Oh and when someone else opens up about it, it’s all love and support and strength but when DICKHEAD FAILURE me does, I’m a weirdo and “negative” and “selfish” and “playing games”.

c34ko8,SuicideWatch,My girlfriend killed herself a week after we broke up,"Hello. I don't really know how to start this. I guess I'll tell you how I met my ex.

Roughly 2 years ago, I was a patient in a psychiatric hospital. As a side note, I've struggled with depression for most of my life, and have had alcohol dependency issues for many many years. While I was in the hospital, I met this girl. We talked a few times, and she told me that she was being treated for depression also, though she didn't seem very depressed at first. She told me stories about her ""previous life"" as a med student, and how she failed out of med school. I found myself drawn to her charms. Not much later, she left the facility because the treatment wasn't working for her. I gave her my number, and she texted me that same day. For 2 weeks, we would text all day, talking about everything; mostly how bored we were, she with her life at her apartment all alone, and I with the therapies. We realized that we really liked each other and went out on a date. Then another, and another. I was so happy to have found someone who understood the things that I had been going through. We were a couple before we even knew it.

Things were still difficult for both of us, but they were near perfect when it came to our relationship. I got discharged from the hospital and started focusing on healing myself before looking for a job. She was supposedly doing the same thing. She came over often, to the point where she would need to ask her mom to look after her cat while she was with me. She met my son. Things started getting more and more clear to me though. She slept a lot. And I mean A LOT, up to 18 hours a day. She was bored all the time. Thinking about finding a job gave her anxiety. There were days when she'd lay in bed all day, get up to do something, and then get an anxiety attack and need to get back in bed. I won't say that it wasn't somewhat tough on me too to see her like that, but I always hoped for it to get better. She'd have good days where she would meal prep for an entire week for the both of us, or make 3 paintings, or talk about going back to school, but it was the minority of her days. I loved her though, and despite her depression she was sweet and caring and funny, and she got along great with my son.

After a year or so, I decided that I needed to start looking for a job. I found it so quickly that I was kind of stunned by it, but happy, of course. She was really happy for me too. I enjoyed my job at first, but found it pretty stressful, even from the beginning. Months passed, and the stress started building up. I started drinking again. Small amounts, at first. I tried to hide it from my girlfriend, but she caught on pretty quickly. She tried helping me. I wouldn't let her. The drinking got worse. I'd come home from the bar late at night to find her waiting up for me, and we'd argue, which I usually had forgotten the next morning because of how drunk I was. She told me that I shouted at her, insulted her, made her cry. I'd be so ashamed, ask her to forgive me, to please please please give me another chance, promised that I would stop drinking. And I would. For a while. Then it would all repeat itself again.

One night I came home late again and we did the same old routine. The next morning, I found her in the garage with her bags packed. Said I had said all kinds of nasty things to her, as I had so many times before. But this time was different. She told me that I had said I didn't give a fuck about her. That I wanted her to leave. And when she started sobbing, I shouted at her to sob less loudly because I couldn't hear my music. I couldn't believe it, I just couldn't. At first I thought she was bluffing about leaving, but when she started silently crying I knew I had fucked up. I told her, of course I don't want you to leave. And then I begged her to stay. Her mom eventually arrived and took her away.

I tried calling her so many times, on her cell and even her parents' landline. I got her mom on the phone once, and she confirmed that she was there, but she didn't want to talk to me. 

One week later, I got a call from her sister. She hanged herself. She apparently left a note, saying how lonely she was, and how I had been her only friend. How terrible it was to hear from her only friend that he didn't care. How it had been the last straw.

I feel sick even writing this. I killed her. I killed the woman I loved. I've been sober for 5 months now, but it's not enough. It's never going to be enough. I feel so guilty. I miss her so much. Lately I've been feeling suicidal again myself. All I want is to be with her again. If I could only tell her how sorry I am. But I can't.

Thanks for reading to the end."
f9d5go,SuicideWatch,Anyone else not want to die and not want to kill themselves but just wish they could just stop existing,
e8gjky,SuicideWatch,Raped in front of my girlfriend. feeling like giving up.," 

I don't know what to say or do, I just feel like my life is falling apart.

Three weeks ago My apartment was broken into by 4 strangers, my girlfriend was sleeping over. It was an awful, horrific long night, and she witnessed every single thing. 8 hours of prolonged humiliation and abuse.

These 4 strangers destroyed me. They shredded every bit of self-esteem and sanity I had. After the hell they put me through, they simply left me there. bleeding heavily and stunned. My girlfriend was tied up screaming, but I didn't move. It took me a while to comprehend that this is now my reality and eventually get up.

Weeks later, I am paranoid, unable to look at my reflection without feeling disgust, and I spend my time in my university lectures thinking about ending my life. I didn't tell a single soul about this because I feel so ashamed. I feel pathetic and weak. My girlfriend is the only one that knows, though everyone around has been telling me I've been ignoring them lately and calling me an asshole for it, yet I don't care. I just feel numb. I want to die, but I'm too afraid to say it out loud. That night they not only violently violated me, but they took something from me, a piece of my soul.

Anyways, ever since that night my girlfriend has been acting different. she treats me differently, touches me differently, and most importantly she looks at me differently. A few days ago while we were sitting together, she told me that it's alright if this experience turns me ""gay"" and that we don't have to continue dating. this is coming from a 19 year old girl that has common sense, it all just made me feel really bad. It just reflected how after all this, how disgusting I feel was valid, that I am gross in her eyes now.

Today is my birthday, I turn 20. I bailed on all the plans and decided to spend it alone. I'm sitting at home drinking alcohol and thinking about bashing my goddamn face in. I just feel alone in a way I never felt before. I just never thought this is where I'd be, that this would be my life.

I hope I'm posting this in the correct place, I've only had Reddit when I was younger. thanks for listening for whoever is out there. Hopefully I'll feel better for writing this.

UPDATE 1:
Two of the assailants were caught by the police today. I’ll post a more detailed update in the next few days. 
Thank you everyone for this support.

UPDATE 2:
sorry I’m late with this, I’ve just been going through a lot. I’m gonna try to give everyone a bit of closure on everything that’s went down. 
The four assailants were part of a sex trafficking gang that my shitty dad got involved with and owed a lot of money. I’m not comfortable sharing the details of this specific aspect, but I hope this general explanation is enough. 
Two of them were caught and will be most likely going to prison as they plead guilty to avoid a trial. 
I’m currently trying to get myself together, but things have been getting worse and worse mentally. I’ve been going to gym, jogging and trying my best to not lose it, I didn’t start therapy, but I’m considering it. 

Me and my girlfriend broke up and there’s no bad blood. I just need to focus on myself. 

And again, thank you everyone for the immense support you’ve given me. You have no idea how much it saved me and made me feel a little less alone. Thank you."

There is true evil in this world. I don’t trust men or women anymore. Everyone is a monster. There were so many women in these videos. So many. For a long time afterwards I was paranoid I was a pedophile, a freak, a creep for having seen them, although I am a bisexual woman who has only ever been with people my age or older.

At the moment im containing myself from crying because she didnt want anyone to cry when she passed and im going to hold up for her since its the only thing i can do right for her.

iq0w21,SuicideWatch,Please remember that NO ACTIVISM of any kind is allowed here. Not today or any day.,"Activism, i.e. advocating or fundraising for social change or raising awareness of social issues (and suicide *is*, inescapably, a social issue) is absolutely against the rules here at all times.  

Please understand that we're all for well-informed, strategically-savvy activism.  It's essential in the fight against stigma, misinformation, and discrimination, and the fight for research, treatment, accommodation, acceptance, and understanding.  Most of us, one way or another, are mental-health activists IRL.  

But activism just doesn't work in a dedicated support space that serves a vulnerable population.  We used to allow it, until the evidence that it was undermining our primary purpose became overwhelming, and, not without regret, we made this rule.  Our population is all too well aware of the issues and causes that need support and largely not in a position to take action, so besides the fact that activism is often salt in our members' wounds, it's a waste of the activists' time.

gzuqi3,SuicideWatch,It’s extremely messed up that you can’t even go to a psych hospital for help with suicidal thoughts without getting a multi-thousand dollar hospital bill.,"I was in a psych ward once when I was 17. I struggle with suicidal ideation daily. I would totally go back and get treatment at a hospital again if it weren’t for the horrible treatment of patients and the bill that would come along with it. My bill at my psych hospital was about $20,000. All because I wanted to jump off a bridge. You can’t tell anyone that you’re suicidal without them throwing you in a mental hospital, but you can’t go to a mental hospital without owing thousands of dollars and being treated like a prisoner, just making your problems even worse. There’s no good solution. I want to have the right to die. Or at least get free help. The suicidal hotline doesn’t do shit. I want real help. And not to be thrown in a hospital. This system is horrible. We are all victims of it. It’s time for a mental health industry overhaul."
c40k9f,SuicideWatch,Not a single person actually cares unless you kill yourself,"If you say you're so depressed you can't function it's ""Aw it'll get better"" and they forget about you. Then when you kill yourself everyone's like ""Oh I never would've thought, I wish he would've given some sort of sign.""


I said how many times I want to kill myself and I think I might do it, but I know if I do people will act like it's a huge surprise.


I've been serious all along. I have a rope tied into a noose in a box in my room, so that it's always ready. I'm not joking or just looking for attention when I tell people I need some kind of help. Everybody only pretends to care and then when you're dead tries to say they cared all along"
ceryei,SuicideWatch,"I am never ""suicidal enough"" to be heard. I am too well-dressed, too articulate, too friendly ""too"" everything to be worthy of any support.","And I am gradually withering away because of it.

Mental health professionals never take me seriously. I can see it in the hint of amusement in their eyes, their disengaged body language, their patronising tone of voice. They say I'm ""too"" well-dressed, ""too"" articulate, ""too"" intelligent. I am ""too"" kind, I smile ""too"" often, I'm ""too"" calm.

This has not only been offensive to me, but it is such an insult to people who are mentally ill and suicidal. Their implication that suicidal people are dumb, frenzied and rude slobs was - and still is - fucking preposterous.

I have tried to get help for approximately 8 years. I have begged and pleaded and been reduced to tears. But unless I'm trying to end my life right now in front of them, it doesn't matter. None of it matters. I don't matter. 

My public face is ""too"" convincing. But this was carefully created and crafted, over many years, because I had no choice. I had no option but to hide the abuse and isolation and pain I have suffered behind a smile. I was never given an alternative, and when someone glimpsed the reality behind this façade, they did nothing.

The truth is, a part of me is frightened of dying, and my survival instincts kick in when I don't want them to. But that doesn't mean I want to live, either. If I could switch off this deeply ingrained fear and just be done with it, I would. 

Why do we have to kill ourselves or almost die before people care? Why do we have to present ourselves in a specific way before we even get listened to? Why do they wait until every glimmer of hope and willingness to live has been stamped out? I hate this. I hate my life. I hate myself. Let me be what they want me to be, please.

**EDIT:** I never ever _ever_ consider others as ""dumb, frenzied, rude slobs"" by the way. I'm so sorry if I made anyone feel that way. It's simply how I interpret the reaction of mental health professionals, when they say ""But you're so clever/hygienic/pretty/well-groomed"" etc. It feels like a slap in the face, as though suicidal people are looked down on if they are well presented, and looked down on if they are not, too (but the latter apparently ticks more boxes from their point of view).
If someone is unkempt, hasn't showered, is visibly distressed or less coherent, I do NOT judge them or advocate doing so. _But using someone's appearance as a way of invalidating their pain? That's **completely** wrong._


**EDIT 2:** Thank you everyone for your supportive comments and sharing your experiences on this subject. It means a lot to me and although it is awful that this resonates with so many people, it also brings me comfort. I am sorry for not responding to everyone yet. If you have had a similarly invalidating experience, I am so sorry. I appreciate the difficulty internalising this, but it is _not_ your fault. You are not to blame for the misconduct of any medical professional, who ought to know better than to belittle us during our darkest and most vulnerable moments.


In positive developments, the crisis team visited me at home this evening. Both mental health nurses listened to me, emphasised that the way I was treated for the last 8 years was unacceptable, completely validated my feelings and showed a lot of empathy. It has restored a little bit of faith in the NHS. They are going to report back to the psychiatry team and recommend that I be allocated a Care Co-ordinator, who will be able to assist me with being prescribed the correct forms of treatment and provide support with finances and social connections. I have not allowed myself to anticipate too much, but I cried with relief after they left. I hope they keep their word. I hope they meant it. I desperately just hope. Until I receive an outcome, I will sincerely try to stay alive. I am not in a position to promise that I will survive, but I can promise that I will try, one more time."
j0ptio,SuicideWatch,"i told my mum i want to kill myself. she said, “ok, just don’t do it in my house.”","that’s basically it. it hurts. i wish people didn’t romanticise a mother’s love so much because then maybe these words wouldn’t sting as much as they did. how is a teenager supposed to feel when the one person who’s apparently supposed to love them more than anyone and anything, doesn’t?

edit: 
yes, I totally understand that parents are just human beings...but when a relationship, any type of relationship, starts to cause damage to one and the other knows this but refuses to acknowledge it or somehow change for the better, then they simply do not care for the person. I only opened up to my mum about depression very recently though I’ve been dealing with it for a few years now. at first, I used to think the reason I was constantly hurt by her actions and words was because she didn’t know the mental state I was in back then so I never blamed her in anyway. but it all became too much that i impulsively told her everything and she still refused to do anything. she’s not empathetic in the slightest and she made it clear that whether I commit suicide or not doesn’t matter to her as long as, like I said in the og post, I do not do it in her house or say anything in my suicide letter about her that’ll give her a bad rep or get her in any trouble. point is, I thought I was suffering so much because I kept my feelings to myself. I thought sharing them raw with her would help even a little but it didn’t and I feel so defeated. people always say you shouldn’t keep these type of things to yourself but there’s comfort in that. giving myself the illusion that the only reason I hurt is because I keep it to myself hurts less than sharing it with others and realising that that hasn’t changed the way i feel. you don’t suddenly get better. it only stays just as bad or gets worse. 

and to anyone and everyone who’s sharing similar stuff, I’m sorry that some of your most treasured people aroused some of the most negative feelings in you. it’s okay to feel hurt but don’t let someone else’s decision to be a dick affect your own life decisions because in the end, everyone will be looking back at their own life and their own life only. make sure that yours isn’t just a reflection of what others have said and done to you.

i apologise if this is really lengthy I know I keep rambling I just wasn’t expecting this many people to see this. to everyone who’s tried to help or who’s hurting, you have a special place in my heart. I’m here if anyone needs to talk."

###Summary###

**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** 

###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###

We're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  

But there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. **It's both possible and important to convey understanding and compassion for someone's suicidal thoughts without putting your finger on the scale of their decision.**

Anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. 

Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  

In [the most useful empirical model we have](https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2009/06/sci-brief), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. 

**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""I hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  

###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###

Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  

* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try"".  People who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   

*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. 

* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. 

* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.

To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.

###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###

Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  

They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:

* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.

* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: 

* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)

* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.  

Please [let us know discreetly](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) if you see anyone exhibiting these or similar behaviours. We don't recommend trying to engage with them directly."

koywap,SuicideWatch,"My parents just laughed about the ""funny"" time I didn't shower, brush my teeth, comb my hair or eat without being forced to for 3 years.","It was from 11-14 and I was suicidal and struggling with trauma they gave me.

My dad called me lazy, my mother said it was my rebellious phase.
They both agreed that it was hillarious.

Why did I not do any of that? Because I was dying. Literally dying.
My chronic illness wasn't medicated, my ADHD and dyslexia wasn't diagnosed, I had no friends and my parents insisted that my transness was a phase that had to be crushed down.

Did I get therapy? No. Not at all. Instead I got yelled at and told to kill myself.
It all ended in me trying to off myself in a school bathroom at 14 which was stopped, not by teachers, but by my friend who was younger than me.

Afterwards they decided to yell at me some more and call me a selfish asshole for ""giving up"".
I only got therapy because my headmaster and math teacher sat me down and gave me an ultimatum.
Go to therapy or be thrown out of school.
I honestly owe them life. They're great.

To this day I still struggle with suicidal thoughts and they still think depression = being lazy and being trans is a sin.

But I won't kill myself anymore. The thing that saved me was not giving a shit anymore.
Cool, my parents hate me. But I hate them too so why should I care what they think?

I couldn't care less about what anybody says. I know myself better than some random chucklefuck or my family.

Also friends. I found some friends.

Edit: thank you for all of your kind replies, y'all are literally the best💖💖
I wanted to add that I'm doing fine right now.
I used to be suicidal, but now it's more suicidal ideation. So I think about offing myself sometimes, but I like being alive too much to actually do it.

Which os a huge step towards healing! This post was meant as a kind of haooy thing. Well, as happy as suicidality can be.
I stopped giving a shit about others opinions and it made me less depressed. Highly recommend it. 
Also therapy and setting boundaries with the people who hurt you.
Learning to say no and when to walk away is the most valuable tool you can have."
g2jkre,SuicideWatch,I just saw a post asking “If you committed suicide a year ago what beautiful things would you have missed?”. I can’t think of a single thing.,"When I saw that post it stopped my mindless scrolling instantly. I have been thinking for almost half an hour now with no luck. Even if I think of the year before that. Although I have been suicidal in the past with many attempts, that was so long ago and I didn’t realize I still felt this way deep down. 

This last year has been be laying in bed day after day other than the few times a week I go downtown and waste my whole cheque on heroin. I guess I haven’t felt like dying because I’ve been so focused on being high. My mom refuses to let me outdoors alone for more than 5 minutes because she can’t trust me to not go downtown and pick up.

I considered finally dating my best friend of 4 years as a thing I would have missed happening, but if I’m honest, things don’t feel the same as they did when we were best friends. I do love him, but now after years of him being clean he’s relapsed. It’s only been a week and he has already ended up in the hospital. He’s one of the 4 people in my life that I actually talk to. The other 3 are my family members.

My dad is across the country with his girlfriend and we rarely talk even though he reaches out. It’s the first year ever that he has not gifted me something for Christmas or my Birthday, which are only a week apart, and it made me terribly depressed sitting at home with his gifts never opened and now stored away in my closet with all the other junk that doesn’t matter. I know my mom is disappointed in me and so is my grandmother who, the same as my dad, I can’t seem to get myself to call back or message. I have no friends. I am alone and broke and unhappy.

This all came out of nowhere. I don’t know what to do. I have been trying so hard to get in touch with a psychiatrist but my office just ignores me and I’ve already called and gone there begging over 15 times in the last 4 months. There is too many things wrong and I can’t solve them all. Every time I told my mom about being suicidal in the past she would get angry and call me selfish, so family is off the list of people I can talk to since they tell my mom everything. My boyfriend interrupts me when I tell him I’m depressed and goes on about his own feelings, so he’s off the list too.

My mother won’t let me leave the house alone at all either, so I can’t get away from her unless I want to leave for good. If I do leave, she will kick me out and not let me back inside, which would force me to stay god knows where. I know that is illegal since I pay rent and sounds crazy but it is only because she fears I will run downtown and pick up heroin. 

Unfortunately, all that is on my mind is getting high. If I do, I’ve got no home unless I go to treatment and there are no options for that currently with this virus that I can think of. Even if there was, I can’t commit. Ironically, drugs are probably the main reason I’m not dead yet and why I’ve been so distracted from realizing I was still suicidal.

• • • • •

I’m feeling a million emotions a minute and I have nothing to stop me from making the “wrong” choice. I’m sorry this story is so long, I just want to be as detailed as I can so if I do end it, I’ve left at least something behind. Everything else is dirty and messy and worthless. I feel that I deserve to end things after all the rape and abuse and hatred I’ve had to deal with in my life. I REFUSE to believe it is a selfish thing to do anymore. 

I’m so, so tired.

Edit: some words."

jf6oe4,SuicideWatch,Today I realized that I'm probably going to actually commit suicide sometime in my life.,"It may not be today, tomorrow, or even 10 years from now, but I honestly think there's a 90% chance that the way I will end up dying is by killing myself. I've struggled with depression since I was 14. I've been making significant progress in therapy and I am the happiest I've ever been. But somehow I keep ensing up depressed and coming back to these thoughts.

I have a fear of being elderly and alone. I am divorced, don't have kids, and don't have many friends. I'm afraid of living in an old folks home and just being forgotten about. And then today I realized that I pretty much already am forgotten about. I moved across the country a couple years ago, none of my family or friends ever call me. My mom never calls, my sister doesn't call. The only time my best friwnd messages me is to complain about her life. She never asks me how I'm doing or what's going on with me. I'm always the one calling them, and if I don't we simply don't talk. It's like my fear of being alone has come true, the only difference is I'm younger and able to take care of myself still. I do have an amazing boyfriend, but lately I keep screwing shit up so I wouldn't doubt it if he left me soon too.

So ya. It may not be today or tomorrow, it might even be 10 or 20 years from now. But unless I have an accident of some sort this will probably be how I die.

Edit: Wow I can't believe how many people have the same thoughts and feel the same way. I'll try to reply when I can. It's comforting to know we're in this together. Thanks for the encouragement everyone. It actually brightened my day a little. And please please don't hurt urselves. One thing that has made a huge difference so far for me is EMDR therapy. I've tried all kinds and that one has helped the most. I still do have suicidal thoughts, but they aren't as often as they used to be, so that's good I guess. Consider looking into it?"
kjm8vf,SuicideWatch,I wish i could donate my life to the person who truly wants to live,"I don't deserve to be alive, i don't deserve anything, i don't deserve any kindness, i don't to deserve this i want to die. I only deserve to die. The only way i will get rest is by dying"
hugg4i,SuicideWatch,Plans foiled by a f**king cat,"So I was going to do it yesterday, had my kit already and was psyching myself up to do it, when this young stray white cat comes up to me and just won't leave me alone. So I brought her inside and fed her. 3 cans of tuna later, she's still hungry and breathing kinda weird, but I'm allergic so I brought her back outside with a tuna can for the road...tonight I was also trying to work up the strength to end it all, when the cat shows up again, but can't eat and breathing is worse. So now I've taken her to an emergency vet and have no idea how long I'll be here, but my plans have been foiled. Goddam cat has no idea what she's done. 

For the record, vet said she's fine, just hungry, so I guess I've got a new neighbor.

Update: she's back in her parking lot where I found her with an extra big of tuna and water, and I know nothing about cats because apparently her ""breathing problem"" was non-stop purring.

Update 2: I'm alive, and a few weeks later the cat is staying with us for the time being until a foster or adopter shows up. Her name is Summer and she loves being part of the family.

Update 3: 5mo later, she follows us on our walks and loves our dog. I'm doing much better now and am going back to school in 4 weeks. Thanks for the love!"
iyhf1k,SuicideWatch,I wonder what it feels like to have never considered suicide,It's unfathomable to me. How do they do it? Are they lying?
l521pq,SuicideWatch,Police showed up.,"Well last night I got close to killing myself last night but than stopped and called the suicide hotline using *67 (supposed to make my number not show up) I got talked down and was extremely tired I feel asleep before I could make a 'safety plan' and the dude disconnected. Like an hour later the cops show up. Freaking out sounded like they were gonna knock my door down. 
Turns out *67 doesn't work with the suicide hotline and my number is still seeable. So thats great, won't be calling again because they also went to my former addresses, including my families house and my bestfriends place, so now I have everyone freaked out and smothering me about this and won't be calling again since I now know if the person isn't comfortable with what I've said they'll send the cops to literally everywhere. Honestly this whole situation has just doubled my anxiety and depression, so thanks suicide hotline dude for publicizing the feelings I didn't want to make a big deal about."
eyjkyc,SuicideWatch,"People say life gets better, but that’s a fucking lie.","I’m 25. I’ve been a depressed, anxious, suicidal mess since I was 12 years old. I’m sick of people saying it gets better. It doesn’t. Everything is more complicated now. Bills are piling up around me. For years I was told I should get a credit card so I could build credit. Finally did it and immediately ruined my credit score. I’m in debt. I can barely afford rent and groceries. I’m not qualified for any decent jobs. I have no skills or talents or even interests anymore. I’m not even pretty or funny or social or anything to make up for being so pathetic. I’m literally just fucking done trying"
cgus30,SuicideWatch,"People always say; ""just"" get a job, ""just"" find a new hobby, ""just"" go for a walk, ""just"" make new friends. Newsflash: IT DOESN'T FUCKING WORK.","Every conversation I have had about suicide in recent memory with mental health professionals or volunteers has included variations of the following:

""Have you considered listening to music?""

""Have you considered going for a walk?""

""Have you considered taking up a new hobby?""

""Have you considered making new friends?""

""Have you considered volunteering/getting a job?""

It happens every time. It happens in every conversation. It happened yesterday, and it happened twenty minutes ago. I finally summoned the courage to text a helpline for the first time because I just can't call one, and this is the only ""help"" I received.

Fuck yes. Fuck yes I have _considered_ every possible option and opportunity to make me **not** imagine shooting a bullet in my skull or dragging a blade across my throat or tying a rope around my neck.

Here's the problem: **It never works.**

I have had meaningful employment and voluntary roles that I genuinely enjoyed. I have socialised and met plenty of lovely people. I have spent the last six years in a loving and nurturing relationship with a wonderful man. I have taken long, beautiful strolls in nature by the river. I have fed the ducks and petted dogs and helped the elderly and looked after children. I have listened to music and played the piano and sang my favourite songs. 

The thing is, I can't walk without imagining myself hurling my body in front of a car, or drowning in the lake, or lying on the train tracks. I can't bake a cake from scratch without imagining myself plunging the kitchen knife into my wrists and bleeding out all over the counter. I can't meet new people without withdrawing, isolating myself and remembering that I am a burden. I am a parasite. I am worthless and I need to just die. I can't trust anyone because I have been abused and broken and betrayed so profoundly that everyone feels like a potential threat, the next predator. I can't work or volunteer or commit to anything without my joints aching and my bones creaking, without my mind spiralling and without my energy slipping away until I can barely move anymore. I can't enjoy a hug with my boyfriend without imagining him choking the life out of me. 

I can't do **anything** without wanting to die and picturing the multitude of ways I could end my life. I could be having an amazing day and feel so much relief because wow, for once I feel _good_. The thoughts will linger in the background and watch. They will creep a little closer and whisper in my ear and stand in front of me then climb inside my brain to remind me that they are still here - that they will **always** be here, no matter what I do to distract myself, to find hope, to find meaning. 

I'm lost. I'm lonely. I'm alienated. I'm tired. It is so difficult to find people who understand, because ""try not to kill yourself"" is not a part of everyone's daily routine. It's not on everyone's to-do list.

I have considered everything. I have tried everything. And I still want to die. Every. Fucking. Day.

I know nobody will read this, but here I want to tell my story. The truth is, I want to live. I just want the pain to stop. 




I’m a 13 year old girl. I’ve been hospitalized 4 times. I’ve been suffering a lot. I have no self-confidence. I have no love for myself. 
I sew. I sew dolls. I love my dolls. Nobody will understand. 



Here is my first goodbye.  To my dolls: I love you. I know when I leave you will go to. I’m sorry. My heart breaks. I wish I could’ve taken care of you better. You saved my life 2 times. You helped me when I needed it the most. I will say all your names. I love all of you. I’m in tears. I don’t want to leave you. I don’t want to go.

I’m so sorry. I love you. All of you




To Miku: I love you. Your not even a doll to me. You are my best friend. My very best friend. You where there when no other human friend loved me. You where there when I cried out for help. You are here now sleeping not knowing anything. I can’t even apologize. It won’t mean anything. I hope in another world we could meet again. I love you.




I draw. Everyday. But nobody likes my drawings.  Here is my second goodbye: to my materials. I wish I could’ve used you more. I wish I could’ve made something worth while out of you. But I couldn’t. Maybe someone else can. I’m sorry.




I used to sing. I lost confidence in doing so. Here is my third goodbye: to my unwritten words. I’m sorry I couldn’t sing you to the world. I’m so sorry.




My fourth: To mommy and daddy and my brother. I love you. I wish I could’ve made you happier. I wish I could’ve made you proud.





And finally Binxy. My cat. You are with me now, in my last hours. I can’t even say anything. You won’t understand. My heart is dust now, because I’m being selfish. You are 14.  I don’t want to make you last years sad. I know you love me. You will miss me. I can’t even say anything. You seem to know. You have your head down. I know I’m being selfish. But please know, I love you. I love you so much Binxy. 




I don’t know what to do. I want help. But I can’t with out going to the hospital. I’m sorry. Please forgive me. Hold my hand. Give me a hug. Anything. With one final cry, please. I don’t want to go. But I can’t stay. I’m sorry. I’m sorry.  I’m sorry."

hhpzqn,SuicideWatch,“Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem” I hate sayings like this with all my heart.,"People who say these sort of phrases have no fucking idea what it’s like to be in severe pain. They have no clue whatsoever. They’re either not educated on cases where people are in severe pain and don’t respond to treatment or they just don’t believe it. They can’t believe life can be that bad that suicide is the only option. And it’s because they’re basing their views on their OWN experience. Their OWN feelings and thoughts which aren’t the same as people contemplating suicide. 

If people who say these bullshit phrases could just take a step back and think about things logically. For example, a person posts that they are going to kill themselves. They have suffered in pain for years, they are damaged, they’ve tried countless treatments with no response and every day is filled with pain. Without the fortune of not being in their shoes, can they not understand why suicide is a viable option? Even if you can’t feel their pain, surely the facts can speak for themselves. You have to be a fucking idiot to read about a case like that and say to them “suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem” or “we have to play the cards we are dealt”. 

Do they really think that the suicidal person( after years of pain) is going to think “this quote has changed my perspective entirely. I think I’m going to live now’”. Whether the person intends to or not, sayings like this are patronising to people who have spent months or years weighing the options. I’m not saying they should just let them die if they’ve posted something like that. But patronising and bullshit quotes, when you can’t relate, just makes me pissed off. 

Although it’s hard and the person just wants to post to let the pain out, they can’t without receiving responses that make them feel patronised and stupid. In general I just hate sayings and quotes. They shouldn’t be applied to be such a common thing that applies to everyone and every case. There’s no right way to respond to someone suicidal, but saying quotes is not the way. Best way I can think of is just saying ‘I’m here if you need me for anything, if you want to talk”. I’m just a big believer in free will. No one should be confined to a life of pain."

k5j3qa,SuicideWatch,The fact that suicidal ideation is so normalized makes it impossible to get help,"My friends joke about wanting to kill themselves constantly. “Haha if I get below a 60 on that test I’m actually gonna kill myself.” “Omg my new teacher makes me want to kill myself.” “My mom is so annoying I wanna die.” 

So every time I try to express that I’m genuinely suffering, they don’t take me seriously. It’s like everyone either thinks I’m an attention seeker or kidding. Even my psychiatrist just looks at me blankly, raises my medication dosage and says “try not to do anything until next week” every single session. The only reason I’m not dead yet is because I can’t find a reliable and minimally painful method.

I’ve been waiting for the right time and the right method but honestly I don’t even fucking care anymore. Next time I get the chance, I’m gone.

EDIT: 
First of all, thank you to everyone giving me support and awards! It genuinely means so much. You’re all such wonderful souls and I’m sending you all the love you need to get through whatever it is you’re going through :) <3

Secondly, I feel like this post is getting misconstrued a bit so I want to clear some things up. I totally get that I wasn’t very articulate - It was just sort of an angry vent and I didn’t imagine it would get so much attention. Anyway, My point in the original post is NOT that people aren’t allowed cope with humour - I even cope with humour myself sometimes. My point is that it’s frustrating that wanting to die has become the punchline to half of the jokes on the internet, so even when you’re trying to talk about being suicidal in a serious manner, people treat you as if you’re kidding. 

I also understand that absolutely no one’s obligated to listen to me. I always make sure that my friends are okay with me venting to them before I say anything even remotely emotional. If they’re not, I totally understand and they have every right to ignore me or tell me that they don’t feel comfortable with that. But responding to my “I’m struggling really bad right now” with a laugh and a joke is hurtful and unnecessary.

I also know that people might joke but actually be serious and coping through humour, but there’s just no need to turn what could be a meaningful conversation into a joke. If I come to someone about something and they respond with “I feel that way too, I’m sorry,” that’s absolutely valid. I have no issue at all with that. Just please don’t laugh at me.

cwpqz4,SuicideWatch,Chocolate saved my life,"My last serious suicide attempt was in July 2018. I had booked a hotel in a nearby city for two days for ''a conference'' and randomly packed up so it wouldn't be suspicious to my mom. I didn't want to do it in my room because in a way I didn't want to defile it? I don't know how to explain it. 
My plan was to do it as soon as I got to the hotel because thinking about it and postponing makes it more difficult and I wanted to make sure nothing would stop me. 
I opened my suitcase to grab my toiletries bag that had my pills but when I opened the suitcase, something dropped on the floor. It was my favorite chocolate, 70% dark cocoa with candied orange bits. It had a little heart sticker sticked on the wrapper. My heart dropped and I couldn't stop crying. Eventually I think I fell asleep on the floor holding the chocolate and when I woke up, I felt something I hadn't felt in years. I felt loved. My mom put that chocolate there to surprise me because she knows how sometimes I'll forget to eat when I'm overworked. 
Just wanted to share that with you because I could really use that chocolate today. I really could."

Kinda like if you've ever had a favorite stuffed animal growing up, and you're still fond of it to this day.

I was left with this chilled and frightened feeling, because it was just so new. It had me stare at the ceiling and think about things. But after that i just thought to myself if i really wanted to die or not. It took me a few hours to meditate and contemplate over what i did and now i feel dumb for even doing that.

I would want to share what's up, but I'm already over it. Though I'm not really against opening up, i just don't want to bother too many people. But i just wanted to share that a curtain hook saved my life by being a bad quality product."
glix2m,SuicideWatch,It fucking hurts to know that not even your own mind accepts you.,
jeoloi,SuicideWatch,"I attempted suicide, almost died and did *not* regret it. Am I truly doomed","I see many people here talking about their attempts, how they immediately regretted it, and how glad they were when they survived. That has not been my experience.

I tried to hang myself last month. There was no apparent trigger, and I really wasn't thinking about much: no friend/family, no lover, no pet, no future. I was just glad to finally get out, and vaguely confused why I hadn't done it sooner. Within minutes I tied a noose, stepped on top of a box, put my head through the noose, and knocked the box over. I was not sad: I was just calm, and relieved for the first time in many years.

I don't remember what happened immediately after (must have passed out), but I woke up lying on my back, part of the noose still stuck around my neck. Apparently the rope snapped after I lost consciousness.

I remember being overcome by a deep sense of disappointment. When I looked into the mirror my face looked horrible, all purple (almost black) and swollen. I knew I had every reason to be scared, but I felt nothing.

It's been a month, and I thought about doing it again-doing it right-every day. I did not feel lucky that I survived. Instead, during the past month, there were countless times I thought: ""I wouldn't have to be doing this if I were dead.""

I know I'm going through a difficult phase in life. I know things \*might\* get better. But I'm just... disinterested. All these good things life has to offer seem so out of reach, and so abstract that I feel no craving for them. I'm so so exhausted, yet nobody in this world would accept me for just existing. Living has become a chore, a resistance to the temptation of death, while I'm not even sure what's the point.

I would like to live, even if for nothing other than seeing it through. I'm just... so unmotivated to. Maybe it's just laziness. I don't even know any more."

Depression can’t even be cured. People say it’s “not logical” to kill your self, but it really is for me at least. It WONT get better. Depression can only be suppressed. I’ll have to live with this horrible pain for the rest of my life. And the things in my life that make it worse are even more unbearable because they’ll NEVER go away, no matter what some fucking stranger who doesn’t even know what I’ve been through says.

i6osjx,SuicideWatch,i wish nobody cared about me so i could kill myself without destroying other lives in the process,"hi. i have been struggling with severe depression for almost 2 years now. i don’t really want to get into it but it’s because of something that is no ones fault and just a case of really bad luck. i wish the people who cared about me recognised that i was struggling and that there’s nothing to do to fix it. but i know deep down that if i kill myself they will blame themselves and it could ruin them. 

i don’t want to be here, i’m only here because i don’t want to ruin the lives of the people who care for me. sometimes i think that i can just continue to live on despite being miserable for the sake of other people’s happiness, but i’m not sure whether i’m going to make it. almost every thought i have eventually loops back to suicide, no matter how happy the initial thought. 

i’ve made a plan to stick it out until my siblings finish their exams. after that i’m pretty sure i’m going to kill myself.

hv2k81,SuicideWatch,Sorry little dude,"I'm sorry to that little kid who liked to build forts in the woods and catch bugs. I'm sorry to the kid who when he god a little older always dreamed of being a doctor or entrepreneur. I'm sorry to the high school student who worked so hard for an impossible dream. How could I ever look you in the eye, how could I ever face you with the way things turned out? My past selves. I'm happy for you. Happy that you got to experience wonder, happiness and joy. And that you always dreamed big. Your dreams were always too big, too much disparity between your skills, and what you wanted. Knowing that those silly dreams thought up by some silly little kid are all but impossible, makes the decision to go a little easier. It's a stark reminder of the cold unforgiving nature of the world. A reality check. I guess you were never really meant for this world, and it turns out stopping the pain is all that really matters now. That and running from the disappointment and dissatisfaction until it chases you down into your grave. But it can't hurt you there. But still, I'm sorry little dude.

g3sz2y,SuicideWatch,I’m a Nurse who killed people,"I can’t shake the guilt. I caught covid from a patient in the hospital I work at full time. I work at a nursing home per diem, and went there while I had a slight cough. The day after I worked there I was incredibly sick, and found out my patient at the hospital had tested positive and moved to a ventilator in the ICU. They eventually died and were the first death in my state from the virus. Right now 30 people in the nursing home are positive with covid.

I just graduated from nursing school a few months ago. I have no paid time off, and the three weeks I was out with covid made me have to empty my savings and use my credit just to pay the bills.

Mentally I’m not ok. I don’t think I am coping well. I drink too much. I have been watching suicide videos and been jealous of their courage to go through with it. 

I feel so good when I work in the hospital. But then I’m isolated in my apartment by myself. My girlfriend of five years broke up with me while I was sick with the virus. She had been in PA school in a differed state and has started talking to another guy. 

I just don’t feel good. I cope with alcohol. I have no other outlets. I have scheduled myself to work 50+ this week just so I am not alone in my bed.

Honestly, I feel like I have been screwed. I was on the frontlines treating this disease before PPE and isolation measures were in place. Now work three weeks off after getting sick I can barely keep with the bills. 

I just want to sleep. I sleep all day, because when I sleep I don’t hurt or think about those I have killed. As a new nurse I don’t think I’m prepared mentally for isolation and tragedy.

Edit: Thanks everyone for your kind words. I’m still hurt, but I’m coping. I started reaching out to people. I am going into a program to stop drinking so much. I am safe. I just needed to vent, thanks for allowing me to do so."

And you know what? Fair. Not even I wanna deal with my bullshit. But at least don't act like you do care when you don't. Nobody tried to help me solve my problems. They pretended they did. All they did was get me to a point where my problems were no longer anyone else's problems and called that me ""getting better.""

eeyc3w,SuicideWatch,I’m an attractive white man from a wealthy family. The odds were always in my favor. I think I’m gonna shoot myself in the face.,"I don’t expect you to read this, just need somewhere to vent. 

Here I am again, sitting alone in front of my tiny space heater, trying to find a reason to keep going. It doesn’t help that it’s Christmas Eve. I’m basically a 24 year old virgin and have spent holidays alone for the past 5 years. I remember Bill Burr said at like 39yrs old he stopped going home for the holidays. I envy that. At 18 I went to college across the country to get away from my abusive mother, even picked a college she hated (“it would embarrass [her]”). Speaking of college, I’m still unsure whether I was molested. It’s hard to say when you wake up to some guy in your bed. The not knowing really pisses me the fuck off.

To this day my mom doesn’t think she’s done any wrong. After I dropped out I went back home for a little bit. I don’t know what I expected. A year or two later I move across the country again to get away. Now I am truly and utterly alone. I’m currently on my 22nd or 23rd dead-end job. Honestly can’t believe I’ve lasted so long at this one. I guess I look up to the store manager a lot and don’t want to let him down. I’ve seen a hundred therapists, been on a million different meds, went to rehab for 6 months, and I feel worse now than I ever have. Depression, anxiety, paranoia, they’re all too minor to describe what I feel. Had my first suicidal thought at 9yrs old. At that same age I realized I wanted a girlfriend. It was like there was a hole in my heart. I think I just wanted a female in my life because I hated my mother. But I knew I was too young and figured I’d get one later in life - nope. Never been in a real relationship. I was with a girl in high school for a couple months maybe. We sorta had sex once but I wouldn’t even call it that. Every girl I’ve tried to pursue since either wasn’t interested or I didn’t try hard enough / didn’t have enough experience to understand what they wanted me to do. Doesn’t help that I grew up afraid of my mother and hating her. 

In college I was so desperate to get laid I went on Craigslist Casual Encounters (when that was a thing) but girls from my floor found those pictures and passed them around. That shattered the little confidence I had. That is just one experience but probably the one that most changed my perspective of women. I wish I could tell those girls how much damage they’ve done. Then all my fuckups with girls just added to my pain. Dating apps don’t work it’s like my account is invisible. At this point I don’t try whatsoever. It’s as if I’ve been conditioned to not make a move. And the ironic part is I look like a model (genes, muscles, six-pack), dress well, and I’m actually very smart. The few parties I’ve ever gone to girls basically threw themselves at me and I would freak out, have a panic attack, and then leave. Alcohol didn’t help. I’m not gay. I’m just broken. A beautiful girl might look at me and give all the signs that she wants me to talk to her. She might even come talk to me first. I’ll just shut down. Afterward I’ll get angry at myself, so I’ve stopped going places where I might meet a girl because I know what’s going to happen. I’ve always found it interesting how much I relate to “ugly” guys who won’t pursue a woman because they know what will happen. And those guys take one look at me and hate me. It’s like they’re thinking “man, if I could just trade places with that guy.” Hahaha ain’t shit would change, man. You’d be just as alone and maybe feel worse than you already do.

At this point the only reason I haven’t shot myself in the face is because of my dog. My cat wouldn’t give a shit but I can’t do that to my dog. I just can’t. The sad part though is dogs vibe off you and adopt your personality, meaning he’s gone from an angel to anxious and quick to fight other dogs. So, maybe it’d be for the best if he had a different owner. Can’t exactly take him to the dog park anymore. And I’m sure you can tell how close I am to suicide because I know exactly where to shoot. For your sake I’ll spare the details. I don’t know why I’m writing this I guess the holidays are pushing me over the edge. I just can’t be alone anymore. The girl I like is a coworker who shut me down for a different coworker who went and cheated on her. And now I feel like maybe she’s expecting me to make another move?? I don’t know. But the way I am, I’m not gonna pursue a girl who shut me down. You know how hard it was to tell her how I feel? Couldn’t even do it in person had to send some stupid message. Now I have to see her every day. I guess that’s why you don’t ask out people from work. 

I have panic attacks every night and the thin walls in this ghetto apartment complex do NOT help, nor do the gunshots down the street. I have no one to call. My dad kind of understands what I’m going through but there’s only so much he can handle. Every time I talk to him I feel like he’s about to have a heart attack. My brother says I have an illness that just needs to be treated. I feel like he thinks I just want attention. Obviously I don’t talk to my mom, I actually blocked her. And the suicide hotline?!?! Don’t get me started. It’s like they want you to die. The two real friends I had forgot about me once they found girlfriends. I don’t know how much time I have left, and I always thought I was destined for big things. You’re all I have left, reddit. You and my dog. Shit, the cat probably wants me gone. 

If you read this far, thank you from the bottom of my heart.

EDIT: Thank you everyone, this was more helpful than rehab. And yes I love my cat. He’s actually really interesting, basically a real-life Garfield.

EDIT 2: I think Dave Chappelle said it best when he talked about Anthony Bourdain. That’s why I used that title. I can’t stand when people think I “have it all,” so how can I be so unhappy. Anyway thank you again, everyone. And thank you for the platinum, whatever it means, that made my day.

EDIT 3: I am either delusional or my coworkers read this post. Not sure which is worse. But it really feels like one of them read it and passed that shit along like a hot potato. I hear them talking and I hope it’s just confirmation bias but it sounds like they’re talking and laughing about what I wrote. WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING YOU FUCKS?! More gossip to gobble up? One of the guys here tried to have a real talk with me, “how bad are these intrusive thoughts getting?” I haven’t been acting different at work. Why would he ask me that? I did have people contact me saying they weren’t on this sub but found it just scrolling through r/all, so I don’t know how many people actually read this. I guess it’s possible someone I know came across it. Funny that I care when I’m so close to ending it all. Glad I got it off my chest though, was a huge weight lifted. And the support from you guys was unreal. I didn’t respond to everyone but I read every single message and comment. Speaking of which, you trolls can go fuck yourselves. It takes a special kind of twisted fuck to hide behind a keyboard and say that shit. But it turns out this post helped some people?? That’s such a foreign feeling for me I didn’t believe them. I don’t know why I’m still writing. I just hate being me. Need this life shit to end."

Edit:  In response to multiple requests, I'm adding a definition of activism here:  ""campaigning to bring about political or social change"".  That's straight out of the OED, we aren't making any special interpretation of it. **Any post that is primarily about raising awareness or changing perceptions is activism according to the dictionary definition and thus a violation of the community rules.**

Some examples of the most common types of activists posts we were here, all of which are totally inappropriate:  

* Advocating for changes in laws around suicide

* Advocating for change in the mental-health system 

* Advocating for changes in cultural norms or common perceptions around mental-health.  These are often related to specific days devoted to specific causes, e.g. World Suicide Prevention Day

Keep in mind that our mission here is individual peer support.  Any post that's not a request for personal support regarding current experience related to suicide is probably a rule violation unless it has the ""Mod Approved"" flair."
kygzko,SuicideWatch,"Just been notified that the cancer in my dad has spread and that he is about to die. I dont want to be an orphan. I lost my mom to cancer five years ago, my uncle in december 2020 and half my family is already dead. I cant. I will kill myself when he dies. Tha pain is too much. Not again.","In 2015 I lost my mom in a heartbreaking battle against leukemia and only refrained of killing myself, because my dad and friends were there. At the beginning of 2020 my Dad started another cancer treatment over the course of several months, just after finishing one treatment before. After the treatment, the tumor was removed and he had other complications afterwards which were resolved over Christmas. But he came back weakened and underweight from the hospital. Then he we got infected with Covid-19. Today he was picked up by an ambulance, because he got weaker and weaker. When I spoke with the Doctor over the phoned, he mentioned that the cancer has spread and that they can only stop its spreading even further - something my Dad kept secret from me. It all makes sense now. He suddenly started buying me expensive presents, despite me not wanting them, stopped talking about next Christmas and suddenly mentioning back up plans and so on. Even the thought alone makes me want to rip out my heart, as the pain is paralysing my body and mind. I dont want to be alone. I no longer have friends. My Aunt is old and sick aswell. My Uncle just died of Covid. Why is everyone dying in my family. I cant anymore. My family is small and taken so fast.

This is it. When he dies I will kill myself as I am about to be alone and that thought freightens me. Only my memories will remain of a happier time and even those a fading. Maybe then I will see my Mother again. Maybe then we will be a happy family again. I am living in the past anyway."

dub69m,SuicideWatch,"3 days ago was my birthday, I should’ve done it but my dog and a redditor saved my life","3 days ago was my birthday. I am getting depressed when my birthday comes since it is supposed to be a happy day, but I know that nothing special will happen.

My birthday was the worst, my friends didn’t even greet me, my boss fired up for some reason that wasn’t my fault and got mad at me, I ate alone and like nobody cares about me. I treated myself a good meal for my birthday, an Italian Spaghetti and Pepperoni Pizza. I thought of that as my last meal, and had cookies and cream ice cream for dessert. I would end it that night, or the day after tomorrow. I evaluated all the important persons in my life if I leave them. My mother would hurt, but I know she can manage. My brother doesn’t even care about me. My girlfriend is just using me since if she doesn’t have me, she’s nothing, and that’s the only reason why I haven’t left her since I know once I did that, she’ll kill herself. My “bestfriend” only talks to me when he have problems but when It is me who has problems, he’s not replying to me so I think I wouldn’t be a big loss for him. 

After hours of thinking and finally decided to do it, I remembered my dog. He would never understand what happened to me if I’d kill myself. I can’t stand the fact that he’ll wait for me to come back after a week, a month, a year, or until the day he dies because I am already dead. I cried and hugged my dog tightly. “You saved my life buddy. You’re the reason I’m still here” I said to him while he just stands there staring at me. 

After that, I just browsed reddit just today and saw something on my inbox. A stranger awarded my last post with a silver. “God loves you. Be easy on yourself.” He said to me. At that moment, I started to cry like a fucking bitch because even if I didn’t know him/her, I felt that someone hugged me and concerned about me. 

To you random redditor who gave a silver (I consider it a gold because of your kind words), I wanted to let you know that it is you who made my birthday special. I love you. 

To my dog, Bay, you’re the greatest doggo of all. Imma buy you all the treats you want. You’re the reason why I’m here. I love you so much.


EDIT: WHAT THE FUCK GUYS MY INBOX IS GETTING FLOODED WITH SUPPORT, SILVERS AND A PLATINUM. I DIDN’T EXPECT THAT. I NEVER FELT LOVED LIKE THIS BEFORE.

kq8e6g,SuicideWatch,"My wife committed suicide, i want to follow her","We got into an argument in early 2020 and it came to light she had cheated on me, and wanted to again. I couldn’t forgive but because i already had depression and knew that i decided to start taking medication because I have never cared about any one or thing half as much as I cared about her.

By December we had both tried to take our lives multiple times and after she found me overdosed in our apartment she promised me she wouldn’t kill herself so I promised i wouldn’t try again. But she had to travel for work and found out she was pregnant while away. 

She immediately canceled the trip and came home to have an abortion but got quarantined and i don’t even remember how many days into quarantine before we had an argument and i wasn’t staying there because i needed to be able to bring her food, the last thing my reason for living said was she wasn’t going to mill herself but wanted to sleep, i said ok. Then she wouldn’t respond realized she was in a dark place and went there as fast as i could but in 20 minutes she had died.

I gave her cpr and called everyone who could help hoping i could save her but felt her body go cold under my hands but i was stupid and hopeful i couldn’t be anything else in the moment, the paramedics got her heart started but she was gone already, i didn’t know and spent the next two nights sleeping in the lobby waiting for news then got told harshly by a nurse who didn’t know that I didn’t know she was legally dead already and i tried hitting my head into a wall to die but all i got was a split skull and a dislocated wrist. Was under suicide watch for a time was there when my wife passed but am not on such tight suicide watch anymore and am trying not to care about how everyone else feels but just kill my self.

i dont know if I should before or after her funeral.


Add on, the last thing her parents said was I killed her and that i hurt her memory by living as a liar saying i was ever good to her. I made videos for my family and friends to explain I don’t want them to be blamed, i have a lot of benzodiazepines left from being in the hospital, and got a bottle of vodka.

I appreciate the kindness and love but mine isn’t a case of wanting people to stop me, and a friend told me that funerals are for the living not the dead so I don’t have to wait"

My cat used to enter in the bathroom everytime I was in. I don't know why. 

Yesterday night, around 3 am/4 am I was cutting myself in the bathroom... that was my 2° time doing it. My cat entered in. He looked at me with his pure and innocent eyes. 

I can't...

I started crying. I grabbed him and hugged him. Everytime I look at him, I think ""who will feed him if I'm not here? He would die"", ""I'm the only one who cares about him (my parents don't)"". So I promised to my cat (I KNOW that this is stupid) that I'll live just for him, and maybe I'll try get some friends/help...

hxw9mg,SuicideWatch,"I love it when people say ""you're not alone"" and yet here I am, alone.",
gk7spi,SuicideWatch,"The logistics of killing yourself are so endlessly, frustratingly complicated","I would literally attempt suicide right now if I thought it would work, but I just feel like I would just end up with permanent damage and be accused of being an attention seeker, when in reality, I just want to die quietly without any fuss. 

I hate hearing stuff like, *""if you fail, it's just a parasuicidal gesture""* and *""there are lots of ways to make sure it works,""* because sure-fire suicide methods are obviously not readily available to the vast majority of people. 

* Do I try to poison myself with household products and probably just end up screwing up my organs?
* Do I try to hang myself and risk brain damage? 
* Do I jump off a tall building and freak out a bunch of people who don't deserve it?
* Do I kill myself in the bath/pool and make everyone else feel weird about using it afterwards?
* Do I lie to get a prescription I don't actually need and potentially get someone in trouble?
* Do I gas myself and put others in harm's way?
* If I write a note, would that comfort people, or would it just make them feel like they could've ""done something"" and make it worse?
* Should I ghost my friends before I do it to minimise the casualties? 
* Is it better for my family/friends to find me, or some rando?
* What place/time would be best to prevent me from being interrupted?
* Should I endure the pain and wait until I'm a bit older to kill myself so that I'm not seen as some immature, self-centred kid and people in my life don't blame themselves?
* If I survive, do I lie and say it was impulsive, and not like, years in the making?
* Should I delete my SNS pages and all the messages that I can before doing it?
* Should I try between semesters in case I fail and need to take a break because I've messed up my health?
* Would me killing myself destroy my religious extended family? 
* Should I quit my job beforehand, or do I keep it just in case I survive?

There is no doubt in my mind that I'm going to do it, but I don't want to before I have a proper plan in place. Partly to minimise the damage, but mostly because I'm just so very worried about the consequences of potentially screwing up. I don't even question whether or not this is what I really want anymore, it's just a matter or how and when. 

I wish this self-righteous society didn't censor 99% of helpful information that'll actually let me die instead of end up sick and injured. I wish I didn't have to feel guilty or selfish for wanting this. I wish people would stop spewing their spiritual and philosophical ideologies at me when they have f\*ck all to do with my personal situation. I wish people would admit that it's possible and even sometimes reasonable to want to kill yourself but not be depressed. I wish people would stop changing their tune about whether or not this will get better or worse with age when it's convenient for them. I wish it wasn't so hard and so morally taboo and so painful and so contentious and so risky to choose what I do with my own freaking life that I never even wanted in the first place."

ij88my,SuicideWatch,Today I tried to kill myself,"I got in a nasty fight with my mom. I always said if my mom stopped loving me or died that would be it, nobody would care if I died. I still believe that, but It never should have warranted this. I sat down, cut into my thigh, and took 13 pills. Doesn’t matter of what. This gives me a high and I start feeling stupid and dizzy. I’m texting my friend and joking about all my trauma and i’m just feeling worse. I tell her about what I did and she naturally got worried. She told me to throw up (I couldn’t) and texted my mom and my best friend. It was such a stupid thing to tell her, but over sharing, my biggest fault, saved my life. At this point i’m dizzy, pained, and nauseous. My mom bursts in yelling at me and tells me to sit down. I tell her i took 13. I never told her why. The paramedics come and i’m sitting on the couch. My speech at this point is calm, almost robotic. I get overly polite around authorities because of deep psychological issues. They check me, vital organs are fine. I’m alive. Everyone leaves the room except for the kind paramedic who was taking my blood pressure. He asked me if I was lying, because I swore up and down it was an accident. I told him the truth. About my sexual violations, and my issues with self worth, and my father and brother. I told him how I didn’t want to die deep down. I wish I did. That would make things easy. They left and my mom cried like never before. She told me i’m her only child, she won’t get another chance. That’s when everything hit me. It was like a new chance. A fresh slate. I looked in my room and imagined it empty. Everything had so much meaning. I couldn’t imagine it going to anyone else, me not using it ever again. I just cried. I’m crying now. I’m so fucking happy I only took 13 pills. However i’m not happy it’s an uneven number. I don’t think I’ll ever try to change it though.

But the thing is, I don't give a crap. I have this feeling inside me that I'm done. I've had good times, I've had bad times. I don't need any more new experiences, happy or sad.

Some people live everyday like it's their last day on earth. I live everyday like my last day on earth was yesterday. I'm just an empty shell, a ghost. My future is just something to be calculated, a technical formality I have to endure. It's a fucked up experience to have at this age."

ghjgnt,SuicideWatch,The hardest part of being suicidal,"The hardest part of being suicidal? At least for me (19 F), it's looking into the eyes of someone who loves you unconditionally and telling them that you're fine when you're having suicidal thoughts. 

My dad is everything to me. He is the most innocent and caring man I have ever encountered. He has tolerated all my rage attacks, crying episodes, tantrums, and has spoiled and loved me ever since the day I was born. I suffer from bipolar 2 and have been going through a severe depressive episode which usually happens around the same time every year. This year I know exactly what's happening and I want to try my best to get past these thoughts. If not for me, for my dad. I have not known real pain until I saw his eyes water today when he saw me crying. He knows me and what I go through. That hurts me the most."
lqpncu,SuicideWatch,I hate the misconception that people who are suicidal don't think about how their family and friends will be impacted.,"I've had several people bring this up to me when I've opened up to them about my suicidal thoughts and honestly I'm tired of hearing it. I know I've thought about my family's reactions a lot when I've been considering a plan for killing myself, so I'm tired of people thinking that we're all just selfish for being suicidal. Not only did I put heavy consideration into my family's reaction, I also thought they probably just wouldn't care or would be better off without me even if they did care. Depression and suicidal thoughts can literally warp your thinking and make it hard to think rationally about these types of things. 
I don't personally think that people who have never been suicidal have any right trying to shame us or make us feel guilty for being this way when I'm sure most of us would do anything to enjoy life and not want to die."

We're thrown into a system completely devoid of any compassion, this isn't life, this is servitude and I refuse to play along anymore. I'm so fucking tired of plastering a smile on my face and pretending like everything is going to be okay. 

Have you looked at the news lately? Everything is falling apart around us, the planet is on fire, people are being rounded up, privacy is non-existent and we're told repeatedly that we have no value unless we've been commoditized. Buy this, buy that, you need this random, useless tatt but we don't! We don't *need* any of it but it's still rammed down our throats day in, day out, bombarding us from every fucking direction and I'm just exhausted. 

I can't do this for another 40 years, I'm done, I'm checking out and I don't mean from the hotel. I'm going to have a large gin and tonic while I run a bath. It might relax me amd there's a niggling voice at the back of mind screaming ""PLEASE DON'T DO THIS"" but I don't want to listen anymore. 

Mum, if by chance you happen to read this, please know that I love you and I'm truly, truly sorry for putting you through this. For what it's worth I'm so glad that you enjoyed Silverstone. I love you. I love you I fucking love you and im sorry

Edit: I'm still here. This has been the most difficult 24 hours of my life but I'm still here. I took the train back today and told my mum I needed to speak to her urgently, as soon as I saw her I told her I loved her, I told her why I went to a hotel and then I broke down in tears like an absolute mess. She told me she couldn't stand the thought of burying one of her sons, we hugged and I cried on her for about 20 minutes. I'm back at home now and reading most of the responses here has been overwhelming. I still don't think I can go on, but I think I'm going to at least try, until it becomes unbearable again anyway."

cb655d,SuicideWatch,This quote about suicide is feeling far too accurate,"""The so-called ‘psychotically depressed’ person who tries to kill herself doesn’t do so out of quote ‘hopelessness’ or any abstract conviction that life’s assets and debits do not square. And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire’s flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It’s not desiring the fall; it’s terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling ‘Don’t!’ and ‘Hang on!’, can understand the jump. Not really. You’d have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling.""

This quote is from Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace.

I'm honestly starting to feel the flames, and the jump is looking far too comforting."

gtdvnt,SuicideWatch,Wife cheated update,"Edit: So I've been getting a lot of DM's asking how I caught her etc and what I did. So I came back from a late night jog as I find it peaceful and relaxing as the streets are empty, I came back home to have a shower of course as I was sweaty as fuck. I entered the apartment and just headed to the bedroom and there is where I saw her with another man in bed. My god damn silk sheets tainted by them 😔😂, but yeah it's weird cause I thought I would lash out but I was unusually calm about it. I told the guy to leave and he was literally shitting himself and scrambling to pick up his belongings, like this guy is literally tripping everywhere. 

I think he was afraid as I was just very calm and he didn't expect it. Anyway I spoke to my wife asking how long it's been happening and she told me who he is etc, it's a childhood ""friend"". After that I went to the train station which is where the first post came in.

Edit 2: People are also asking how long we were together. So I met my loyal and faithful wife at 14 and we got married at 20. So in total that's 12 years of faithfulness from the amazing wife. 

Edit 3: Holy shit whoever gave the platinum thanks so much???

Edit 4: People are surprised that I'm over this so quick and I'm calm about it, I guess it's down to the fact I live by the rule that is ""the pains compulsory, sufferings optional""

So it's been about 10hours since I posted this and honestly thank you so much everyone for all the support and comments. 

I'm not going to lie when I posted the previous post I was at the train station just waiting to jump infront of one but as stupid as it sounds the comments honestly helped. 

I've now kicked my wife out of our apartment and the bed that she was sleeping with the guy in, I have now burnt. Which kinda sucks as it was a king sized bed with silk sheets and everything but I wouldn't have even been able to sleep in those cheat stained sheets now no matter how much I scrub them. 

It felt good tho to actually burn it cause it was letting things go, I've cleared out all the things that reminded me off her and basically smashed it up so kinda like smash therapy and it felt amazing. 

Her parents know that she cheated on me cause she tried to spin it that I cheated on her however we have cameras in our apartment and I just sent them the videos 🤷🏽‍♂️.

Now her family has pretty much disowned her which I feel like it may be a bit too much even though she is a shitty person but honestly I couldn't care less.

I'm free, feeling a bit shit but I know I'll be happier and honestly if it wasn't for you guys I probably wouldn't be here. 

Thank you so much everyone, especially the dude that was talking about pasta 😂"

fzu0jt,SuicideWatch,I'm a pedophile and I think I'm ready to kill myself,"I've never had a normal sex drive and I thought I was asexual for a while, but I guess the reality is more insidious. I've struggled with Pure O OCD ever since I was a child, and at first I thought this was it. I've always worried about hurting people. My sexuality has been an topic of anxiety since grade school, since I have been borderline asexual my whole life. Late high school was when it began, although I was never able to accept it then. It hit like a truck last summer where I had multiple panic attacks due to these thoughts that put me in a mental hospital. I hoped the drugs they gave me would help end the fetish, but they only helped the anxiety and depression. It has been getting steadily worse ever since. Most therapists understandably don't want to see me. Yesterday I masturbated to an anime child (thankfully I have never looked up illegal images). I think at this point it hit what I had become and I lost hope for redemption. I am a ticking time bomb before I ruin someones life. And I can't live with myself like this. I can never have a SO, or a family. Even having friends feels wrong. It's going to be be hard as I actually enjoy my life quite a bit. But I feel like this is the only responsible and logical thing to do. End it now while I'm still me, before this takes over. From now on I plan to stop taking my meds, as the mood swings will help me get this done. Then end by exit bag or hanging while listening to Avril 14th. I am tired of the self pity and ready to take responsibility. Wish me the luck and courage to end this. Thank you.
Edit: Still here. Going to look into some more mental or physical health options before making a decision I think. Thank you for your kindness even if I don't understand it."

Everyone is moving forward with their lifes while i slowly decay in my room,i feel mentally stuck at 16(23 now).

I feel trapped, overwhelmed. I'm too sensitive for this world, too empathetic towards everyone. People like me aren't made for the cold reality of life and capitalism.

Suicide is the first thing on my mind once i wake up. Death seems so comforting and warm at this point. Suicide seems inevitable.

Happiness doesn't seem possible,i have no future. I feel so fucking alone. I just want someone to care,i want actual friends,a family,a support system. Everyday is getting harder, I'm slowly dragging myself along until i muster up the courage for another attempt.

Why doesn't anyone care? Why don't i deserve love? Why was i even born?"
7yaf24,SuicideWatch,I hate how when you’re depressed you just forget everything. You forget to do stuff and you forget the stuff you did. Time passes without you realising and instead of doing nothing for ten minutes you did nothing for three hours but you didn’t even realise you were actually living.,
5nii2l,SuicideWatch,"Anyone else here ""suicidal but not suicidal""?","I'm suicidal, but not *suicidal.*

Know what I mean?

In other words, I'm not ""suicidal""-suicidal.

Know what I mean?

That's not to say I'm doing it for attention, though, either. (That's a common assumption/misconception). My pain is very real. My feelings of wanting to die are pretty genuine.

Basically:

**I was just wondering if there was anyone else out there who, like me, has decided *not* to kill oneself—essentially, to continue living—despite the persistence of suicidal thoughts/feelings/ideations/wishes.**

I will not kill myself.

But some days, I really don't want to be alive anymore."

I never was able to develop a true friendship in high school due to my reoccurring depression and generalized anxiety. But now, I have no one and it’s mostly caused by my own actions due to deleting all social medias, avoiding social interaction at school and talking to no one. When you’ve given up on life a long time ago, you don’t care if you have friends, so I’ve been isolating myself until noone remembers me. Eventually, I will have the courage to kill myself and when I do, noone will remember if I was even here."

Mental health support reminds me of this post I saw a year or so ago:

>That's the thing about any of these people they get to talk to you; therapists, counselors, any of them. There is a limit to how much of your issues you're allowed to show before you're deemed out of hand. They can handle the conventional issues that they were taught in Psych 1 but anything beyond that gets you thrown in a mental cell and a combination of pills shoved down your throat.

>The simple truth is that if you are born different, you are fucked. Your life will be one of exclusion, sadness, loneliness, and not having a place to belong. There are simply no resources for those on the fringe, because the world was built for the majority."

This whole time I thought i was alone, when my sister was feeling the exact same way i am right now. She was only 27. She lives four hours away so we are going to her house now. It’s currently 4:11am in new zealand and all i want to do is cry. We have different dads and we don’t really look a like at all but she was always my number one supporter. She was always there for me and always babysat me when i was little. I have a scar on my pinky from the day she jammed my finger in the door lol. We have so many photos together. She always used to come over for christmas and for my birthdays. I can’t even type right now i’m in so much pain. I still can’t and don’t want to believe this. Someone I knew so well gone just like that."
f6vgg2,SuicideWatch,Nobody talks about the after attempt,"I tried to kill myself. I overdosed heavily on a cocktail of pills and medicines. The advice i have? Don't. Nobody talks about the aftermath of when somebody saves your life. The people who know you are torn apart by grief even though you survived. And you get to see it. And you also get to see everybody talk to you as if on eggshells, treat you like you're a kicked puppy.  And the guilt is worse than that before. Because you caused that and they won't admit it to you. The guilt is soul destroying. And then there's you. Your stomach can't handle anything but water and plain bread. The sharp stabbing pains and rises of nausea that knock you off your feet. The shaking for no reason- entire body failing to function correctly at any given moment. Sleep? No. You will wake up routinely every hour or so. And that's if you can fall asleep after fighting your guilt over trying and the physical pain its caused on top of what made you try in the first place. Oh. And when you finally think your body has recovered? Its worse. You cant go out without being drained and you have literally liquid shit. Like youre peeing out of your ass. Water can even make you feel sick. 

Okay sure. You wanna die. But a lot don't succeed. And the failure is grim. I have liver damage, my stomach linings are non existent. I'm suffering more than before and i could never try again because of who i affected and the damage i've done.

Edit: it's been 3 weeks. I have to take medication for my stomach otherwise the pain is horrible and i am still just shitting and vomiting stomach acid"

It’s always just been a day to really drive home the point of how alone and removed you are from everyone else . I hate being alive so much , every day is just pain and loneliness. I hate myself beyond belief and I’m tired of it . There’s a bridge by house over the highway and on my walks I always think wow I could just jump this but I never do , I never do .

kfm89k,SuicideWatch,Passive suicidal thoughts are taking over my life.,"I’m 21, just graduated from college, and I am so ready to stop existing. I think about suicide pretty much all day everyday. I don’t think I would ever act on it, but I think about it every second of the day. Every inconvenience that happens every day makes me think about wanting to die. I don’t have active plans but I think often about what it would be like to disappear or die. I want an escape so badly. Life feels so heavy. These thoughts are overtaking me, yet they are somehow my only escape. 

I’m not sure why I am posting this, but I just felt like I had to get it out. I haven’t shared this with anyone in my life because I am afraid my family will think I’m just being dramatic. I’ve struggled with depression for most of my life and I am on Zoloft, but I’ve never felt this bad. Any support would be greatly appreciated."
ak2d7u,SuicideWatch,"They'll let you be homeless but tell you suicide is ""never the answer""..","Honestly, this is one of the most puzzling things about society. People tell you that ""we don't live in a vaccum. everyone has people who care"" along with other shamings of suicide calling you ""cowardly"".

But when you want to live...oh no. You're entitled to nothing. If you don't do well in school your parents kick you out and you end up homeless liviing on a cardboard box. 

But remember, don't kill yourself because ""people care about you so much""

I understand having to work to participate in society but I find it so stupid that people can't see the incongruity. I can't honestly imagine telling a homeless person freezing in the cold ""keep struggling because life is worth it"". If they want to die, then let them die and vice versa."
ffcy1q,SuicideWatch,"If you make enough suicide attempts, people stop caring.","That’s what I feel has happened to me. It’s like I don’t have the right to say “I’m sad” anymore because I either get ignored or eye rolls. 

I’ve come up with a pretty fool-proof way to strangle myself while I am unconscious, and I have decided to have another go at trying to die (this is my fifth attempt, my first I put a gun to head and chickened out, second I stranded myself in the wilderness, third I tried to mix pills, and fourth I basically drank poison).

I didn’t think it mattered, being supported. 

Maybe it’s seeing friends cut me out of their lives one by one. Maybe it’s family looking annoyed and just saying “I’m sorry you feel like this.” Maybe it’s my marriage partner flat-out saying nothing when I tell him I want to die. Maybe it’s my mental condition that causes me constant grief and pain, then shoots me up to mania so I feel like I have no control of my life. Maybe it’s because I’m spending my life savings just sitting at home jobless, I don’t contribute to society, I should be allowed to be euthanized. 

Thanks for listening like usual r/suicidewatch, I appreciate it, no one else wants to. Though you have my gratitude, I hope I never post here again, because I will finally be successful."

Please no :( i want to stay here at home.

In school i do nothing but sit myself in the school toilet wishing it will be over. The loneliness is so strong. St home i can fill my Time out and ignore it. In school i have to face it. I'm scared because I'm not ready.

This got way more attention than i expected. Thanks everyone.  I'm going to see how it goes...

kr5hpn,SuicideWatch,The worst part about being suicidal is realizing I’m not in enough pain to do it—yet.,"I know how I’d do it. Sometimes I sob and punch the wall and try to remember why I’m supposed to stay alive. I try to picture how devastating my death will be to people around me—even the people who hurt me—anything just to find some desperate scrap of nobility or meaning in my pain. But I still just want it to end. I want off the ride. So I decide how I’m going to do it and crush meaningless diversions like notes or cries for help—but something stops me. And then the cruelest wave of despair hits me. The only possible reason I can’t do it is that I’m simply not in enough pain yet. It’s enough to torture, to make every moment meaningless, to make sleeping and waking a living hell—but the reality is that if my torment was bad enough, I would end it. If only I could die of despair... How could it get worse than this? I don’t know, but it will."
j2cmuj,SuicideWatch,I wish I was allowed to commit suicide.,"I hate how suicide is so stigmatized by society, and how much guilt-tripping there is surrounding the issue. I am not ""mentally ill"" for being suicidal, rather my wish is a product of rational choice. I no longer believe that life is worth living and I am not interested in living it. Everything in the whole world dies in the end, and I would rather that end be sooner so as to avoid putting up with all the hardship in between. I can hardly bring myself to be interested in anything anymore, so to me the world is at best boring and at worst painful. I have little interest in ""improving"" either myself or the world, as both things turn to dust in the final analysis, along with any accomplishments I or anyone else might make. I just want this whole pointless existence to be over already, as I see literally no point in it continuing. I am aware that this might hurt people around me, but honestly their entire existence, let alone any pain they might feel, is as fleeting and pointless as my own. I just wish it was socially acceptable to see that suicide can be a rational decision and to act accordingly. Maybe then people would not feel so trapped in a worthless life, and would be able to commit suicide in a relatively safe and painless manner rather than using their own makeshift methods."
i6y5rt,SuicideWatch,"""If you were REALLY suicidal, you wouldn't tell anyone about it. You'd just do it.""","Those words were said to me hours after I attempted suicide and was recovering in the hospital, trying to get my kidneys to work. 
I called 911 on myself because I knew I wasn't gonna die anyway. At least, not for days and days after the overdose of the medication I chose. I was told by my guardian that I did it for attention. Totally not true, for the record. Instead of supporting me like I really needed it, most people turned their back on me or punished me in some way. I spent 2 weeks in a psychiatric hospital. That was my 8th inpatient hospitalization for the same reason.
I was really suicidal. I still kind of am, just not as strongly as I was then. I've tried to move on and not attempt again. I haven't told anyone I'm feeling this way again because I don't want them to think negatively of me again. I'm so tired of being alone.
Sorry if this makes no sense. Depressive episodes usually don't."

fqtx8q,SuicideWatch,Anyone else going to miss the part of them that could have been so great?,"The real part of yourself. The part that had dreams and ambitions. The part that dreamt of meeting someone you could fall in love with. The part that used to get comfort from things so simple such as showering, sleeping and eating your favourite foods. Maybe movies, tv shows or sports that made you feel alive and hopeful. The innocent part, now buried by the pain inflicted by your mind. This is not a post of optimism, more just typing what floats in my complex mind.

I think we all knew the potential we once had, and could not imagine things to flip so unfairly. Some recover, others don’t. Others endure the pain knowing they can never break free but accepting it. Some can’t end their lives due to the pain, others can more easily. 
I used to think I wouldn’t miss living if I died. 

But I don’t think that’s true. I would miss the part of me buried deep within. Not the part swarmed by all these mental illnesses, but the part of me that was inclusive, kind and dreamy. Realism is a terrible thing for people suffering, with no indication of improvement. And the way hope plays on your mind and pulls you back, can be a terrible thing too. Do not let hope control your life. Personally, no matter how comforting hope can be, it has a harmful agenda in the long run. What if the hoping never ends."

After the hospital, I had to attend therapy for two years. Therapy did help me cope for the most part but towards the end, something else started building up. I know I should have said something about it, I just felt like my therapist and my family were already so proud of me and were happy that I was so close to finishing my treatment. I started having compulsive feelings, whenever someone raises their voice at me, gets angry with me, or anything that makes me feel embarrassed (or just anything along the lines of those things), I just feel like shutting down and my mind and thoughts just go straight to wanting to kill myself.

I don’t know whats happening with me, I had been diagnosed with bipolar depression in middle school and took medication for it, it worked at first but then it made me feel completely numb.

And like cutting doesn’t even give me any sort of nice relief it doesn’t do anything for me. Wanna know why I do it?

That just makes me feel even shittier because I should be seizing the opportunities I have, but I don’t. Keeping myself from spiraling down even further is like a full time job, leaving me no time or motivation to do anything else. 

I don’t see how I can possibly move past this when I can’t even bring myself to have a basic daily self care routine. I feel like I’m working my ass off and moving literally nowhere. I’m 30 with no job, no money, no girlfriend (or friends in general), and no self esteem. 

I’m a fucking manchild who still has to be supported by his parents. I constantly see and feel the judgement of people when they start to piece together my life and realize I’m just a fucking loser.

I’m so lucky to have parents who offer to help, but they’ve already spent so much on me that I just feel fucking pathetic making them do anything else for me. I can’t stand leaving the house now and I’ll put off simple tasks like getting groceries for weeks, rationing my food and sorta starving myself until it becomes unbearable and I work up the courage to go outside.

Everyone I get close to fucking leaves me and I’m sick of building up relationships just to be broken down over and over again. This shit is fucking dumb and I really don’t see the point in putting myself through all this suffering just to inevitably end up with a mediocre life. This wasn’t how shit was supposed to go down.

I just wish my parents weren’t around so I didn’t feel so bad about killing myself. They’ve already lost their only other kid, and I can’t put them through that pain again, especially when I have a choice. But I just don’t see how things will get better. I’ve been spending fucking years trying to improve myself and I feel like I’ve only gotten worse."

Things were good, better than good. You were smiling that idiotic smile that I love. Wearing that old and faded track pants that I begged you to throw away but you never did. Then you saw me. Your face lit up. You came towards me, held my hands and said the silliest, stupidest joke that I ever heard. You know I don't like jokes but you still make me laugh. How do you do that??

We were together after such a long time. Me nagging you, you making me laugh, falling in love all over again. It was just like old times. 

I saw you today. But then I woke up.

I wanted to hold on to you, to be with you and never let you go again, to go back into the dream where you were. But I couldn't. The harder I tried the farther you felt. 

Realization hit; I'd never see you again, I'd never talk to you, nag you, hold you, be held by you, give you the cherry on top of my ice-creams because I still don't like them. 

I hate you.

I hate you. I hate you. I hate you.

I hate you because you never loved me enough. I hate you because you never trusted me enough. And I hate you because you were in pain and you never bothered to share it with me.

Everytime I needed you, you were there. You never complained about the time. You let me cry, shout, rage when I was in pain. You helped me so much. But you never told that you were in pain. Why?? Why didn't you??

Did you not think that I'd do everything to comfort you. I may not have been able to take away your pain, but I would've held your hand through it. 

I hate you. and I'll always hate you. Because I love you. and I'll always love you. 

No one can take your place. You were entirely special. All that sickening positivity and patience. Was it all a lie then? A mask? A cover-up for your feelings?

I'm sorry I failed you. I should've looked deeper. Should've been a better friend. May be if I didn't rely on you so much, you would've been comfortable to rely on me. Is that why you couldn't even say goodbye?

I hate you and I'll always will. And someday I'm going to die as well. It may be now or eighty years from now or anytime in between. I'm going to die and then I'm going to find you in the afterlife. And I'd hit you and kick you and scratch you and strangle you and God knows what else. But I'll never let you go then. I'll always, always be with you. 

Till then, I'll hold you in my heart and dreams and memories.

I'll always love you, you perv."

jyagp1,SuicideWatch,My sister tried to kill herself two days ago.,"So. 

So. Friday night, my sister took a whole bottle, 60 pills worth, of her antidepressants. Beforehand, she had called around and apologized to a few people about things that I'm not privy to. This set off alarm bells, and somebody called emergency responders to the scene. 

When they arrived, they found her with a note, and... well, she survived. They took her to the hospital, but now she is in a behavioral health clinic. A state away. And we can't go see her. 

I am at a loss. I. Don't even know if this is the right place to come with my story. Or even what I want by telling said story. I just. 

I almost lost my sister. I was *this* close and had no idea. None. I hate this feeling. And I can't even go to her. I don't know. I don't know where to go, or what to think.

I think if I was more charming or attractive maybe people would be more understanding, idk. I also think people are just generally selfish as a coping mechanism for their own difficult lives. They don’t have room for anyone else’s issues. 

Anyone else experience this?

kzv0ef,SuicideWatch,I started writing a suicide letter and all I came up with was “I’m sorry I tried”.,"I’ve always contemplated writing a suicide letter. Never in my life did I think I will reach a stage where I actually write one. It all started like any other day, woke up wondering why the fuck am I still alive. I felt this intense suicidal feeling that I have only felt once before when I started taking my medication. I spent the day in bed crying wondering why the hell am I still on this earth. The only things holding me back I realised were one, I don’t know what comes after death, and two, the thought of upsetting my friends and family. But at night, even these two didn’t matter. I sent my phone PIN to my best friend and I told him to open notes if anything happens. Went on my notes. Wrote down: “I’m sorry, I tried”. Who was I apologising to? Thinking of it now probably my friends and family? Maybe myself? It doesn’t matter. I know I have tried to get all the help I need and even that wasn’t enough to make me feel better. I sat on the side of my bed crying, staring at the drawer where I have pills I can easily OD on. Scared as fuck, for the first time too I call the suicide hotline for help. After about 30 mins of talking me out of it I go back into bed and cry myself to sleep. The guy said there is strength in knowing your limits and your vulnerability but honestly that meant fuck all to me. I still feel like I want to end it all. I still feel like my life has ended and it’s only a matter of time before I kill myself. I still feel that no matter what I do my life is not going to get any better. I am so tired of getting meaningless support that only makes me feel worse for not getting any better. I am so frustrated, angry, and exhausted. I am honestly so fed up with having to fight every day just to survive for the next day.  This fucking sucks."

lrka22,SuicideWatch,I’m 26. I live at home. I can’t handle the stress of a 40 hour work week. I’m your town’s loser who never made it out.,"I don’t think I’m made for society. I haven’t been able to stay at one job very long, and at my last interview, the interviewer basically said I was stupid for changing jobs so much. I don’t know what I’m doing. I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to keep a full time job. I feel like I’m just weak and not made for this world. In school, we learned about how the less adapted animals don’t make it, and I feel like I’m one of those. Everything feels foggy right now. I think I’m the guy in the neighborhood that everyone talks about. I’m the one who did fine in school but it just didn’t pan out. I’m my sister’s alcoholic brother (I’ve been sober for a while, but still). I’m my parents’ son who never left the nest. I don’t know how long I can keep up this “everything is okay. I’ll tough it out” act for. If I just stopped existing today, I’d be fine with it. Best case, I move on to something new in an afterlife. Worst case, there’s nothingness so at least this pain would stop. I know I’d be missed, but I feel like they’d get over it. Eventually, I’d just be a distant memory. I don’t know how I’ll ever get to 30 or if I even want to.

Edit: I just wanted to say thank you to everyone who commented or even upvoted this. I’m definitely not alone, and while I don’t wish this feeling on anyone, it’s nice to know I’m in this with others. I didn’t do anything to hurt myself, and today I contacted some psychiatrists and looked for a therapist. I’m in a much better place mentally, and I am so grateful for all of you."

There was no pain other than a sting, but once I did it I got to the hospital asap, I haven't seen anything like it but once it happened I just wanted to cry, being alone is harsh and I respect anyone who goes through it.

I hate working these goddamn meaningless jobs that only serve to ruin my day. New job already is off to a terrible start and I can’t imagine it’ll get better. 

I have constant irrational thoughts about many aspects of my life and it makes me want to puke. I will never know what it’s like to be “normal” and it eats me up inside. How does it feel to not worry about everything, even things that don’t make sense, but my brain convinces me are real?  

Nostalgia is not comforting. I remember parts of the past and only feel pain. 

I am fundamentally broken on many levels and I do not believe repair is possible. The only permanent fix is a bullet to the brain. 

Goodnight.

Edit: I am very grateful for the kind words many of you have shared. I am so sorry that many of you feel the same as I; it’s truly unfair that modern life is built this way.

kl157u,SuicideWatch,I tried to hang myself today. I need a reason to not try again tomorrow.,"Woke up at noon. Stared at the ceiling, slept again, woke up again and stared at the ceiling for a while once more. Took a thick cloth belt from the closet, tied one end around the bookshelf, put the loop around my neck. 

First thing I noticed was the pressure. My face felt like it was pulsing and expanding, like I could feel myself turning red. Then a loud ringing in my ears drowning out everything else. Then choking and sputtering as I breathed in and couldn’t. Arms and legs spasmed, took a conscious effort to not reach for the belt. Twice I tried to die, but both times I couldn't help but struggle to ease the belt off my neck. Strangling myself made my being alive feel so much more immediate, which was nauseating compared to the dissociative sad stasis preceding my decision to die. Which is ironic because I had previously believed I'd want to be conscious when I die, but it would be so much easier to just slip away silently in my sleep or something. I now have petechial hemorrhage all over my face, and some on my neck. My throat perpetually feels like it has a lump in it. I have a persistent bad headache, nausea, I feel like I can't think more than one looping thought per minute, I can barely focus on any coherent train of thought nor input from the physical world. It has taken me hours to write this. Honestly, not a good time. 

This is not the first time I've tried to kill myself and frankly, I am seriously worried it won't be the last. Somehow I feel both like I want to end my life and also like I don't, and in those fleeting moments of unsuicidal lucidity (madness?) I try to find ways to save or at least prevent myself from what I might do. I've heard that stuff about people who survived jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge saying right after they jumped they realized all their problems were solvable and they shouldn't have jumped, but for me that wasn't really the case. After the second try didn't succeed I kinda just sat there for a while feeling nothing. It was oddly soothing, feeling totally blank when usually my mind and emotions spiral incessantly in a depressive pattern. I wasn't relieved to be alive, I felt no new resolve to live my life to the fullest or even at all, and most of all, the things that made me want to die are just as present and real as they were before I strung the belt around my neck. In fact, the biggest thing that made me decide to die feels itself immortal and unkillable:

Evil. The world is evil, pervasively and ubiquitously so. I have been on the receiving end of it in more ways and more times than I care to remember, and I know I've contributed to it through my own thoughts and actions. Yes there is beauty and love and joy in the world, and such things are real and important, but in my experience they are fickle and pale in comparison to the omnipotent, omnipresent capacity of human evil. They don't make life worthwhile to me, and it follows that I don't feel as though life is inherently worthwhile either. To find happiness is fortunate and fleeting, because evil is the backdrop, the default. You are guaranteed to find evil, and you never need to look far.

Since I was a child, I would cry for hours on end, heartbroken at the suffering and horror caused by the evil humans do to each other. Why do people suffer, and make others suffer? How can such a world, and a life in such a world be worthwhile? I am 25 now and in that regard, I haven't changed much at all. If anything, it's more unbearable now. I have searched my entire life for something to make it make sense. I've read novels and poetry, I've read and listened to various religious and spiritual teachings, I spent years studying philosophy, I've listened to and made music, I've seen and made art, I've talked to people who seem able to cope, desperately trying to find something to redeem this shithole of a world. And I'm still as empty handed as I was years ago, but it feels worse now because I'm surrounded by failed explanations and justifications and it feels like I've run out of new ones to consider. Being surrounded by the husks of failed answers to that eternal, painful question feels somehow more desolate than being in a void of none.

Frankly, I don't want to live in a world plagued by the sadistic, broken darkness of the human soul. It feels maudlin and perhaps naive to say that the bottomless evil of humanity is what made me decide to take my life, but it's the honest reason. And it's not going anywhere anytime soon. The final words of Nicolas Chamfort in his suicide note have always resonated with me: ""And so I leave this world, where the heart must either break or turn to lead."" 

Right now, I don't want to try and kill myself again. But I don't know what to do to make sure that doesn't happen. I don't know that I won't attempt it again tomorrow. It's highly unlikely that I'm going to have a transformative experience that reveals god and purpose that solves it all in the next few hours a la Cat Stevens or something. I feel that perhaps this is the kind of situation where one should check themselves into the hospital, but the thought of being isolated and constantly monitored for several days is straight up terrifying and sickening, on top of the worry of medical costs and not wanting to strain medical services further as they struggle in the current pandemic. I need an answer. I need something, anything that makes it less horrible. What makes life worth living, in spite of all the evil? How? How does anyone face this and manage to live, to find meaning in life, to wake up and feel like it's worth it? Why shouldn't I try to kill myself again, when evil springs eternal, when I contribute to it myself? Why should I try to go on living in an evil, broken, disappointing world?"

Currently, receiving  any mental health is near impossible because my health insurance doesn't cover any resources in (or remotely close) to my area, (and I can't afford the funds to travel out if I had to).


  Out of despiration,
I turned to God in my darkest times, who continued to promptly ignore me **and actively made things worse immediately afterward.**    Felt like I prayed to demon or something. So turning to God/faith is absolutely out of the question. I'm done tearfully pleading my case to the ceiling.
 

Living each day is like a chore. It's not living. It's nothing but soul-crushing days followed by sleepless nights. Self confidence? Never heard of her. If I had a clear path out, I'd do anything I could not to be me.

I’m alive so my death doesn’t hurt anyone around me. I hide it so it doesn’t hurt anyone around me. There is no reward for not killing yourself every day. no thank you for spiraling by myself, cutting by myself, getting drunk by myself so no one sees. 

I am successful, pretty, young, happy, and loved. And the pain continues. I don’t think anyone will believe how crushing it is.

--EDIT:

Guys, I am so moved by your comments. I posted and expected silence, but your support feels like a wave pushing me forward.

Something beautiful someone shared: ""Those who suffer are never alone because those who have suffered have their back unconditionally."" I see you all. Thank you for seeing me."
he6nf5,SuicideWatch,"Likely won't commit suicide, but if someone pointed a gun at my head, I'd probably let them pull the trigger.","Does anyone else feel this way? I've been depressed for so many years, and I've been suicidal all this time. I've yet to attempt suicide, although I've come very close.

I doubt I'll commit suicide any time soon, partially due to the small spurts of dim hope I feel once in a blue moon. The bigger reason though, is because my sole living direct-family member is having a rough patch, and I fear they'd kill themselves too.

Nevertheless, if someone threatened to shoot me with a gun or I was caught up in a situation that endangered my life, I probably wouldn't mind too much. It would be even better if I could sacrifice my life for someone else—maybe then my life wouldn't have been in vain. I recognize the hypocrisy in that statement; after all, if I were willing to sacrifice my life for someone else, then why not sacrifice myself and live for the sake of my family member's life? I suppose that makes me selfish...

And yet, I can't help but feel drawn to such a death. Dying at the hands of someone else would give me a chance to die without the guilt of willfully abandoning my only family..."
ge4tw1,SuicideWatch,I hate living in this world. Everything is about money and I’m sick of it.,I don’t want to sound ungrateful or like I’m complaining. But I’m really fed up with living in this world everything is so expensive I’m so miserable. I feel like for the rest of my life I’ll be slaving for some green paper till I’m dead and gone. I’m tired of paying bills and I’m tired of living here. People keep saying that this is a free country and you can achieve anything that you want to. But how can you when everything is so hard. Nothing is free here everything has a price tag. Everything is not easy they make life a living hell. I feel so trapped I’m tired of it I want out. The crazy thing is we cannot take none of this with us so why is it so much pressure and stress on us to make money. I understand this is the way the world was formed but it’s honestly draining.
lj3nrl,SuicideWatch,"""Don't kill yourself, live for other people, it's selfish to kill yourself,"" Why do people say this?","Why does the difficulty and pain of existing with depression and your own desire to kill yourself matter to people.

Isn't it more selfish to expect me to go through this and just live for the sake of your guilt?

I guess this notion is fine except normally it's offered instead of actual help. If you're society doesn't help how can they ask you to continue?"
i53sce,SuicideWatch,It hursts seeing your friends have fun when your at home thinking about whether or not you should live.,"No one knows that I’m going though this so I can’t really blame her for ignoring me. When I do bring up my feelings and how she hurt me, it always turns into an argument. “Oh so you’re saying I’m just a bad friend?” And then when I don’t tell her it’s “you never tell me anything.” I’m so tired of having to tell her what to do or how to make things up to me. We’ve been friends for 6 years, I wish she just knew to apologize without being contradicting and defensive. When she tells me that she’s hurt I beg her to tell me why. I make sure to sit down with her and get to the bottom of things until she feels better. 
Anyway, all of that is just useless drama and doesn’t have a lot to do with me thinking of killing myself, but it sure doesn’t make it easier to live. Basically it sucks that I hate myself and my friends seem to hate me too.

Edit: the amount of upvotes on this post is really concerning, I truly hope you all find happiness :/"

It’s close to midnight. It’s dark and cold. My door is closed. As I lay about to fall asleep I hear something. I’m half awake half asleep so I don’t really acknowledge it. I turn on my right side and try to fall asleep again. But then I hear something. I open my eyes too scared to turn back over to see what it is. It sounded like someone was crawling beside my bed. Here I lay, trying to figure out what it is. Then I hear a very loud “hey!” Yelled right in my ear. I instantly sit up and look around my room but of course I see nothing. I must just be paranoid.

It was a few months after my mom married him. I never really liked him. When he did what he did, I was too young to understand what it meant. He’d put me on his lap, grab my sides and butt when my mother was working. He called me his “favorite”. It was just touching then. How I wish it never had to be more. 
~••••••~
2007
We had just got back from a family party the first time it happened. It was really late at night and my mother went to sleep as soon as we got home I remember being half awake as she told him to carry me to bed as I was already sleeping from the car ride home. Their room was upstairs mine was in the basement. As he put me to bed he started touching me. By then I was awake. He was on top of me and told me to be quiet as he held his hand over my mouth. I remember crying and looking out my bedroom window counting in my head thinking of when it was going to be over. I was in so much pain. When he was done, he told me again how I was his favorite. I couldn’t do anything but cry. The next morning my mom was already gone at work and there I was, stuck in a house with a monster.

2013
It was going on for a few years now. Yes, I did want and try to tell my mom about it, but I was so scared she wouldn’t love me anymore and would blame me for it happening so I never did, because he said if I told, she wouldn’t want me anymore. In school my grades dropped, my attendance dropped, and I’d never pay attention. I felt so alone and so scared. Yes, I did self harm as I felt that the pain of that would not hurt as much as the pain from him. I did run away, and when my councilor found out, I talked to her, I told her an excuse saying I didn’t wanna go home because I hated when he yelled, I couldn’t tell her the real reason was because of what he did to me almost every night. I couldn’t tell her as much as I wanted to. I felt so isolated. She called him and he had picked me up from school, when we got home he immediately did what he did to me almost every night and said I deserved it for being bad. My mom was always out working as she worked two jobs and would really only be home 7am-12pm.

2015 
A few years later and it was still happening. I was sick every morning and when I told my friends about it they joked around saying I was pregnant. I laughed along but in my head I thought, “could I really be?”. I remember stealing a pregnancy test from a pharmacy and took it as soon as I got home. It was positive. I felt sick, then and there I wanted to throw up, no not from being pregnant but from being pregnant from him, my step father. I just wanted to die. I remember a few days going by as my mom cleaned my room she found the test. She yelled at me for not being careful and was yelling at me for becoming pregnant at such a young age. Little did she know, the father was the man she married, the man that has been sexually abusing me for years, my step father. I miscarried at 10 weeks, as bad as it may sound, I was glad I did.

My mom had finally divorced the piece of shit after she found out he was cheating and I had so much relief after that. I thought finally no more pain. Later that year, I was constantly getting in trouble, doing drugs, trying to be cool hanging with the “bad kids”. I was expelled mid freshman year. I started going to an alternative school for kids who got expelled from high schools. There I met a friend I’ve known since kindergarten. We started hanging out everyday after school. I thought to myself that wow someone is actually being nice to me. There was this Friday where I was hanging out with a different friend when I ran into him and his friends. We decided to all hang out and we went in an ally way to drink and he had given me some pills saying it would get me “high”. Being the uncaring trying to fit in cool kid I took them and drank. My friend I was with had left with some dude that he was hanging with. So it was just me him and his other friend. We decided to go chill in a stairwell. I was so gone off whatever I had taken and from all the drinking I did. I remember him asking to have sex and I said no. I passed out and next thing I knew he was on top of me as his friend watched. I quickly pushed him off put my pants back on and as I ran down the stairway crying I seen him and his friend high five. I called my sister for a ride home but didn’t tell her what happen. When I got home I started crying to my mom but all she did was yell at me for coming home late and didn’t even ask me why I was crying. I went in my room wondering how could he do that to me? Someone I knew since elementary school. How could this happen. As I laid in bed, I thought to myself that I was nothing. I was already being sexually abused from my step dad for years and now it happens again at age 16 from someone I called a friend. By then, all I wanted to do was die. I thought after that monster was out of my life I’d be a little okay, yet it happened again from someone I knew and considered a friend.

2018
I am 18 and I try to drink every weekend I can with older friends. Because I didn’t want to be sober on weekends when I was by myself I didn’t want to be alone with my thoughts. Because on weekdays I’d be occupied by work. So weekends I’d just drink every chance I could. It was not good. Everywhere I went to drink, there was always one dude touching me and pushing his self on me. I thought to myself wow I really can’t get away from this stuff. All my life I’ve endured so much pain from people I thought were supposed to protect me. Sure I drank and maybe you think it’s my fault for putting myself in such a situation like this. I couldn’t get away from it. I thought to myself the best way out of this hell of a loop is taking myself out. I’ve attempted suicide 3 times the past year. Soon it will be my time to go, because all I feel is pain and loneliness. I’m so scarred and paranoid from the things my step father did that every night I have to sleep with ear plugs in and a blanket over my face because I’m scared that he will be standing next to me even though I know he’s gone. 


Not the place to post, but at the time, I just needed it out of my mind. And yes, cops were eventually involved for everyone asking. "
j9f1nj,SuicideWatch,"Why do all the articles that show up when you google ""reasons to live"" absolutely make me want to kill myself even more?","UPDATE: So yesterday was the lowest that I have felt in a very very long time. I reached out to my Dad, he blew me off, reached out my mom, she gave me hippy bullshit that I didn’t want to hear. I finally decided to go to my GF’s place to convince her that I’m okay enough to get my gun back so that I could go through with ending my life. Instead I broke down as soon as I saw her. She listened and cried with me then encouraged me to reach out to my therapist. I just had an emergency meeting with my therapist and we built a plan for what I will do the next time I feel this way. 

I am going to try medicine even though I still feel most of what’s depressing me is based in reality. I wouldn’t describe my current state as beyond suicidal ideation but I will say that I am at least considering trying things to help. 

Thank you to everyone who messaged me and commented below. And to anyone who is seriously considering self harm or suicide... I understand, you’re not crazy and you’re not alone but don’t listen to your own brain right now. Spill your guts to someone, anyone, hell send me a message. But seriously consider that your brain is fucking with you right now and you can’t trust your opinion of yourself when you are on this mindset.

I’m still here today and I hope you all will be here with me dealing with this dumb fucking life tomorrow.

kwhzmx,SuicideWatch,I often think killing myself is the most logical step to creating a better world.,"I don't like myself. I feel intersectionally toxic at the core because of a shitty religious upbringing and my own autism. I am lazy and self-centered, stubborn and unkind. I've been in therapy/on medication for a few months to some avail, but when it comes down to brass tax I think I should probably be killed sooner rather than later. 

I don't have a plan to commit suicide at the moment, but I do think if I ran into myself on the street I'd probably push myself in front of an SUV.

lfqio9,SuicideWatch,"Every time I consider suicide, something keeps me holding on.","There hasn’t been a single day these past few years where I haven’t thought of offing myself. No matter how attractive I became, how many good people in my life I’ve had, all the lovely experiences and memories that brighten my day, I’ve always hated myself and my past. I was a Poor Hispanic who never appreciated his family enough. I never realized how much hell my mom went through to keep me happy. I tend to forget how wonderful my sister is.
In 2020, I got blessed with so many beautiful blessings every moment I wanted to just blow my brains out or jump off the bridge downtown.

And now, as I sit, depressed and tired in my room, I stumbled upon a letter from my younger sister on how much of a wonderful brother I was and how I need to let go of my demons, and it’s pushing me to go further.
Im not telling anyone that it gets better, or going against the rules on here, I just know that some divine being is telling me to hold on, to grab tight and never let go, never let my light burn out."
bjzs6w,SuicideWatch,"Just graduated from college today, planning on taking my life tonight.","Like the title says, today I received my bachelors in medical lab science and have every intention of taking my life tonight. I am not sure why I am making this post, maybe its a cry for help or just a way to make me feel like at least one person knows why I took my life on a day I was supposed to be happy.

Here's my story for anyone who cares to hear it. I grew up in a household with a very verbally and occasionally physically abusive father and a mother who could do very little to stop what was happening considering she was just as much a victim as I was. I also have a younger brother who my father favors and can do no wrong. Growing up, I would get yelled at for the smallest things and had to be careful whenever I did anything whilst my brother was apparently special and needed his space so he could do whatever he wanted. He didn't have anything wrong with him, like a mental/physical disability, he just was allowed to live how he wanted while I took the blame. He ended up dropping out of school first year of high school and working with my father in construction while I went on to college.

Where I live, the minimum wage is far below what is the minimum you need to live. This meant that even working a job while going to college, I had no choice but to live at home. My family problems became less of an impact when I simply locked myself in my room the moment I got home. It was normal for me to never speak to or even look one of my family members in the eye for weeks to months at a time. That being said, it comes to no surprise that nobody in my family attended graduation. They probably didn't even realize I had graduated at all.

Life at school wasn't any better for me. I was overweight and not exactly the most attractive person so I was more or less left alone save for a few bullies here and there. I never really had any real life friends and it became customary for me to find a quiet spot away from everyone and eat alone during lunch and attend my classes quietly. Even if I wanted to talk to others, I found that incredibly difficult because of severe social anxiety. So I just went class to class, graduated high school, did the same in college. Never having friends never really bothered me probably because I don't know what having a real life friend is even like in the first place.

The only part of my life I would have considered to be somewhat decent or even normal would have been when I logged into WoW. I was about 13 or 14 when I first started playing and that was the only time I ever found a place I felt like I belonged. I eventually got used to getting know know people through them talking to each other over ventrilo (I very rarely spoke and never on coms) and I felt like I belonged even if i was just some quiet kid on the side. Eventually what I would consider to be the highlight of my life going forward would have been when I became very close with someone I met in my current guild. We were both 15 and became very close and eventually became a couple. We were together for 7 years and helped each other finish high school and get into college. Because of circumstances, we never ended up meeting in real life over those 7 years, mostly due to her mother being extremely over protective. Despite that we spoke and played many video games together over those years. Neither of us had real life friends, but that never mattered because it was us against the world.

It was 2017 when she left me without a word or reason. She had been depressed (not eating, staying home from class, ect.) for about 3 or 4 months prior and I did everything I could to try to lighten her day best I could but it seems that nothing worked. This was all very stressful for me and I am sure I might have said somethings out of frustration from time to time, but all I ever did was try to help. I was trying to plan a trip to visit her, but that wasn't easy considering we lived of opposite sides of the US. Before I was able to finish planning out the trip she suddenly blocked me on everything and I never heard from her ever again.

The following two years were a living hell for me. I had been accepted into the medical laboratory science program at my college just one month prior to her disappearing. The whole reason I pursued that degree and career was so that I could easily find a fairly high paying job anywhere in the country because of the high demand for medical lab techs. The plan was to graduate and find a job immediately in her state and move there to be with her. However she was gone now, I was still accepted to the program, and had nothing else in my life so I just kept going with the program. Flash forward to today, I've now graduated and even have a job in my field already (note new hire wage doesn't even pay enough to live on your own in this state) but I feel completely empty. The whole speech about how we will go forward into our careers didn't even feel directed towards me, and all the congratulations felt wasted on me.

I know I planned my entire life around someone who I've never met in person and I am fully aware how stupid that is. Honestly I expected things to work out better considering we had been happy together for a 3rd of my life up to that point, but regardless of that I know how dumb I am. My entire life has been a joke and even the biggest accomplishment of most peoples lives today, for me, was just a joke set up by another joke.

This is why I have every intention of ending my life tonight. I have no family that will care enough if I am gone, no friends that will miss me, i'm sure my boss won't be happy that I am gone but I was only still a trainee anyways so losing me won't affect anyone's schedules, and my position will be filled by my classmate who deserves the job more than I do anyways.

Sorry for this being so long (23 years is hard to condense but I did my best), maybe didn't make any sense at times, and I am not sure this is even the right place to post considering I've never posted on reddit before so if it gets removed that's okay. Maybe at least one stranger will read this and know why I died since I don't plan to leave a suicide or anything of the like so I guess this will be it. Thank you to whoever reads this for taking the time to learn about me and maybe even care that I died.

Edit: Thank you everyone for your kindness, it really does mean a lot to me. I struggle a lot when it comes to talking to people and I find it hard to reply to comments but just know that I am reading them and can't thank all of you who have shared your stories enough. I'm going to keep fighting today and try to get through today best I can."
ee66b1,SuicideWatch,Do you guys ever feel so horribly alone even when you're around close friends or family?,"I feel like nobody gets it, life feels so fake and plasticy.

fua0n1,SuicideWatch,'sUicIDe iS tHe eAsY wAy OUt',"Is that supposed to deter me?

Why would I want to take the hard way? I'm TIRED of taking the hard way, that's literally why I'm suicidal in the first place.

Trying to make us feel bad for wanting to die really isn't helpful. 

It just makes me feel like a terrible person for being weak which makes me want to die even more.

I really don't get some of these arguments...



Edit: I don't mean to say that the actual act of dying/taking your life is easy, but that suicide is giving up, and giving up is easier than continuing to live. I hope that makes sense.

It's like the actual suicide will be intense and scary, but afterwards I'll never have to experience anything ever again and I won't ever have to be conscious again."

We originally said we were gonna eat them when we got them but the more we hung out with them, the more we realized how smart and kind chickens are. As stupid as it was, they were part of the family. We named them, celebrated their first eggs. Cuddled them, spoiled them. Like I said, they were family. 

Now imagine the absolute horror I felt when I saw some big ass dog eating my babies while they bleed out screaming, knowing I could’ve saved them if I wasn’t a lazy piece of shit. I ran out there as fast as I could screaming in terror. At first I thought it was just a case of a stray dog because there was a hole in the side of the cage but then I started investigating. 

The dog had a knot around his leash connected to one of the perches that were stapled to the ground. 

The lock on the bottom of the door was open but the top was closed. My sister and I always close the top and the bottom. 

After we got the dog out, we found five alive chickens and put them in a dog cage but he had no interest in them.

The hole in the side of the coop was jetting outward, meaning something tried to escape

I think that what happened was that someone waited for my mom to leave to go to the park 7:40 am, grabbed the dog, put it inside the cage, unhooked it to tie the leash to the perch, the dog tried to get out which in turn led to him biting the hole in the chicken wire, and halfway through the dog’s escape the intruder pulled it back in, causing the bloody pieces of dog fur on the rim of the hole, the the intruder made his escape through the door but since the door was jammed he only locked the top lock.

It’s probably the same person who broke into our cars about two days ago. I don’t understand why I’m being targeted. I called the police but they of course didn’t listen and just took the dog to paws. Someone needs to be in jail for this. I know that if this happened any other year the police would’ve put more effort but they’re probably just trying to make a statement that blue lives matter just cause I’m black. 

Also my parents and I have been arguing like crazy. I came out as trans (ftm) to them maybe like 2 months ago and it’s been downhill from there. My mom was supportive at first and then I told my dad and she suddenly switched to his side?? Now she keeps being passive aggressive about it by constantly saying stuff like “Some girls have guy features but you don’t. You need to embrace how PRETTY you are. YOURE such a PRETTY GIRL.” My dad finally let me cut my hair but he constantly bashes on trans people saying stuff like “Trans people don’t deserve rights because they’re mentally ill” despite me being not only trans but also schizophrenic. And he also threatens to take away my internet every time I respect anyone’s pronouns. They’ve also been arguing between each other a lot more. Nothing physical but they get really loud and it freaks me out because I have really bad noise sensitivity.

I want to get out of here so bad. Not like my home but this entire existence. I could rant on and on about how much I would enjoy an eternal slumber but I’ve already been typing for like 2.5 hours so I should stop here

TL;DR Someone killed my pet chickens, broke into my car and my parents hate trans people despite me being openly out to them"
lvcexy,SuicideWatch,Is this really it,"How am I supposed to believe that anyone can feel anything other than whatever it is I feel.

I used to spend years trying to put into words how I feel and I truly no longer care.

People emotionally abuse me. I abuse myself. At this point I don't care. Seriously, I'm not even special with my problems. I'm a genetic boohoo feel sorry for me because I don't know how to deal with life bitch

Any pleasure is momentary. Any feeling is pain. At what point do you allow yourself to stop fighting. Why must I fear death if this is life.

It doesn't matter I speak too much and do to little.

Have a good day"
k2kti9,SuicideWatch,my rape ruined my life and I can’t escape it anymore,"after i was raped, i got into a relationship w my best friend and current boyfriend. i love him more than anything and he’s been great for not just my mental health, but he has helped me find hope so many times. 

because of the rape, i ended up creating a fake past where i wasn’t a virgin and ive dated other men. i don’t know why it happened - it’s not excuse at all. my therapist thinks it just happened because i needed a way to cope, so i made up a new past for myself. it just has been painful to watch me be with him knowing ive been a liar and it’s my fault. 

i just don’t know what to do. i cant escape the rape. or my own faults. i have attempted twice. i was hospitalized in a psych facility once and it was horrible. because of the rape, i wasn’t able to walk for two months. it ruined my life and school. i failed two semesters of college and had to redo everything. i just can’t do this anymore. it is too hard and im 20 now - i cant imagine life getting better from this point. 

i just don’t know what to do. i feel like i have nothing left."
h887xb,SuicideWatch,I just joined reddit. I'm 40 years old and suicidal. I have problems with porn. I've never had sex with a woman.,"At the suggestion of my therapist, he recommended I join reddit.  So, I'm giving this a try.  I'm 40 years old and suicidal.  I live in New Hampshire, USA.  I have been thinking lately, that, it is my time to leave this world.  I am also addicted to porn and have been viewing it for years.  I've never had a girlfriend, nor have I ever had sex with a woman.  I have only seen one escort in Boston, Massachusetts.  I was excited (too excited) about the prospect of having sex that while the escort and I were lying in bed nude (she was caressing my chest up and down) and she put her hand over my d\*ck, my rocket launched unexpectedly - yes, premature ejaculation.  Sometimes it happens.  Needless to say, we didn't have sex.

I am so depressed and lonely.  I have come to the realization that I'm unattractive to women and that there is no point in living anymore.  I hate my job.  I work in a call center for a major Boston-based insurance company.  It's a terrible job.  I get yelled at by people and I'm completely exhausted every day after talking on the phone with customers.  My job has nothing to do with my college degree.  I majored in marine transportation while attending a maritime academy.  I worked as a junior ship's officer aboard oil tankers for 2 years, but eventually I was fired.  The captain who fired me thought that I was incompetent.

My porn use has escalated.  I look at it almost every morning before I have to sign-on to my work computer to take calls from customers.  I'm working from home right now because of COVID-19.  Also, I don't look at porn on my work computer - I'm not that stupid.  I only look at porn on my personal computer.

In 2017, I asked out a woman at work who was older than me.  She was in her early 40s.  A beautiful blonde who had a very sexy face and a beautiful body.  Anyway, I got rejected and sometimes I think she rejected me because she thought I was ugly.

I'm currently seeing a psychologist and a psychiatrist and the therapy just doesn't seem to work for me.  I feel so hopeless like nothing will ever get better.  I don't think that I will ever find a woman because I am unattractive and skinny.  I was going to the gym to lift weights, but then I stopped.

I did attempt suicide about a year ago.  After my attempt, my family suggested that I go to the hospital.  So, I went to Portsmouth Regional Hospital in New Hampshire into their Behaivoral Health Unit.  I spent 7 days there.  After I got out of the hospital, I felt better but then later on I started looking at porn again and felt depressed and lonely.

I've tried dating sites like [Match.com](https://Match.com) and [OKCupid.com](https://OKCupid.com) and haven't had any success.  I had a subscription for about 1 1/2 years and decided to unsubscribe recently because I just wasn't getting any responses from women.

The only thing that keeps me going are my two nieces who are 8 and 4 years old whom I enjoy playing with like hide-and-go-seek, ride bikes, play catch, play Monopoly and swimming in a pool.  I just love them so much.

Any advice?  I plan on seeing another escort because my goal is to have sex with a woman.  I just don't I have much of a life left in this world.  My uncle committed suicide at 45 years old and I've been strongly considering the same thing.  Maybe sooner if not later when I reach 45.

Thank You for reading my post."
jtgib2,SuicideWatch,This is by far the loneliest and saddest birthday I ever had,"I'm literally just sitting here playing games, hoping something falls on my head. From minute to minute the need for inflicting pai.n or more raises..."
g80e6c,SuicideWatch,"I told my abusive narcissistic sadist of a mother to “Fuck off, eat the shit that comes out of your mouth & die painfully you sadistic cunt!” Right before cutting contact with her.","My mother has been cruel, verbally, emotionally, psychologically & physically abusive ever since I can remember. For example when I was diagnosed with schizophrenia & severe depression when I was 7, she took a tarantula from outside, threw me in a closet, threw the spider in & locked me in there while screaming like a banshee. That 8 legged monstrosity bit me 5 times before I passed out from fear. When I woke up, there were 4 more bites. She always made me her scapegoat. The first out of my 9 suicide attempts took place when I was 9 years old. When she found out that I started cutting myself, she severely beat me & called me a mistake. Years have passed & after starting to see a psychiatrist, I was diagnosed with severe PTSD & a severe anxiety disorder. I tend to drink to cope with my problems. If anyone were to personally ask me how I would describe myself, I’d say, “Damaged beyond recovery & broken beyond repair.” I barely sleep in fear of yet again reliving my past in my nightmares. I’m 24 now & I’ll be 25 this year. Damn, to those who read this post, I need to know. Was I wrong to tell her off like that?"

gq7agw,SuicideWatch,My despicable legacy,"Today, as 25th may I've decided to kill myself. Not sure if it's because I've finally gathered enough confidence, or if it's because I finally understand things I didn't before. I do not seek help, however, attention would be nice, to be heard at least one time in my life; to finally show the world my most secret flaws, my archivements, the things I've accomplished, the bad memories, overall: to finally tell my despicable legacy. 

I feel invisible. 

I've been invisible my whole life. While never completely ignored, always felt invisible. 
I feel alone, even when I'm with the ones that are close to me; it is something I've been trying to stop for around 10 years, but finally give up.

At first, I was born as an accident, I've never been told that, nor made feel that way, but is clear that a mother who is 19, and a father who is 21, didn't exactly planned a child outside even a stable relation. 
I was lucky to be born in a somewhat rich family. I lived with my mother, her parents and my uncle until I was 5, then moved to a flat, with my mother and her new husband. 
From 0 to 4 life was decently good, I don't personally recall any bad experiences, but I was told recently from my grandmother that I would usually cry and reject being taken from my home to hers. I don't know why. 
My dad was poor by that time, he was still studying as a ecologist. He was present, to be fair, he was more present when I couldn't remember. 

From 5 to 12 I lived in the flat I mentioned early. I was there alone most of the day. Now I think, what kind of parent would leave a kid alone in a flat at the age of 5? Well, one that clearly didn't care enough. At 6 I joined school, the same monotous hell I assisted for 12 years. I never really fitted with the average person. I wasn't an outcast, or a creep, I had friends. They weren't good friends, but they were friends after all. We would normally go to each other houses and play together, watch movies, etc. 
I never did good in school, I barely did decent. Parents reacted in the only logical way they could think of, by beating me. Luckily my mother and dad broke up when I was around 3, so each of them went their way. 
My father never, ever hit me. He was a rational man who believed in dicipline through love, tho he never showed me love. 
Nothing particulary especial happened from the age of 6 to 12, besides being bullied by some classmates; leading me to bully the ones who were weaker than me, which I completely regret. 

At the age of 10 this odd feeling started in my chest, some kind of void? Some kind of sucking force that was draining my energy, my happiness and somehow, my willing to live. I didn't understand it. I had no idea why it was happening. Suddenly, the world was no more love painted. A great hatred towards this new enviorement grew in me. To see everyone as an enemy. Years later I understood that was when my depression began, my daily prison, the loneliness I feel every day; that was the starting point. 
At 12, I cannot recall what was in especific that made me cut, but something made me look for some kind of redemption in flagellation. I enjoyed it to some degree. I never did it to a serious level, and I stopped fairly quick, it only lasted for around 6 months. Months of carving my hatred and depression in my horrible body. 
I forgot to mention that I've been called, or been made feel ugly my whole life, untill today. So a natural doubt about myself, and my body arise, and it's been here with me since so long... 

At this point I'm a bit drunk. Getting everything ready for my departure, as I listen to There's no beauty left here, amazing album. 

Sadly I never got hug any significant another, let alone kiss. I never felt the love of someone else, never got to cuddle anyone, to trust, to love, to have sex with, to share my thoughts. I've always been by my own, I've always been alone. What saddens me the most, is that I've never been heard. I've always been ignored.

Invisible. That's what I've been feeling like for about 4 years. 

Everyone around me gets talked by others. Others interact with others, but not me. 
It covers many aspects, not only been talked but... I don't know how to explain it. I am a somewhat smart person, but sometimes I believe I'm really invisible? 
Sometimes I talk to people in real life, and they just ignore me? 
Philosophy has been an interesting topic for me, yet I cannot answer myself. If I'm ignored like that, am I even there? Was I part of a community? 

But this is about the good things I did, too. 
I joined the fire brigade. Had a good time there, it filled myself more than any other activity, I helped men, women and children. Tho it was never enough to bury the loneliness and emptiness I felt. 

I also rescued a kitty that was pregnant! I called her Mamou, she had 4 little kitties which I gifted to people I knew who would take good care of them. 

But it's been 2 years since I've been living on my own, Mamou died 3 weeks ago, which made me realize the futily of life. But overall, made something a bit more clear for me. It wasn't hatred what I felt for the world, but disappointment. We've come so far as a species. We have so much potential, but it's been wasted, and me myself I am guilty of this. I haven't done anything remarkable. 
I am disappointed at the selfishness, the antipathy, the greed, and the distancing of humans. 

For those reasons I am sorry for whoever will have to clean my body, or cremate it? I am sure my parents won't want a funeral for me. I mean, even less with whats going on with the world right now 

That leads me to my next point, betrayal, backstabbing and abandon. That's what some of my friends did to me. They ditched me out of their lives like a spent torch, like a used tissue. 
Sure, I did a mistake, I admit it. I did many mistakes. But looking at them in a objective way, is not much different of what our true nature is, in other words, I never did something worth abandoning your friend, and then getting them fired of their job.

Quarantine is fucked up, makes me realize that the little chances I had of meeting someone before, now are completely gone. Tho it hasn't been all bad, I got fit. I lost a lot of weight. I've read hundred of classic and cult books, same for music. 

Anyway, to the last point. The things I most regret in life? Probably not being more myself, that would have probably brought more pain, but it is uncertain. 
I regret never meeting and loving someone, it was harsh seeing everyone around me find someone, everyone but me. 

If you made it this far, I cannot properly explain how much I appreciate the time you dedicated reading this. This is more attention than all the one I've been given through my whole life. It felt really good to open up after so long

I am Tomás Renard, these are the last words I want to say before leaving this world, and venturing into the next one. If anyone is concerned, know I will leave happy that at least read this post. I will leave with the only thing that has been here for me my whole life, a nice bottle of pipeño wine"
j1yrto,SuicideWatch,Fuck Friends,I lost my best friend. She told me she can't take my depression. Like I ask for this. Fuck her. Im over trying to open myself up to people and then stepping on me. When I kill myself they will all be sorry. At least I would be at peace. Fuck people.

bayxv8,SuicideWatch,"Sleeping is so peaceful, I hate waking up.","When I am sleeping, nothing around me exists. No duties, no burdens, no depression nothing. I can just live. Even dreamless sleeps, where there is nothing but darkness feels so comfortable. I can just close my eyes and leave this world for some moments. 

I am so tired. So tired of everything. They always say ""there's light at the end of the tunnel"" but I've been running and running with no end in sight. No relief in sight. I'm just endlessly running while wearing a mask of a sane man."
ll6ip3,SuicideWatch,Okay fuck it. I'm telling my therapist.,"In telling my therapist I'm suicidal, I've attempted on my life in the past 6 months and that I'm loosing control. I need help, I don't care if they throw me in the psychiatric ward. Actually I'd prefer that. I'm really scared of the consequences though. Am I going to hurt my family? Or myself? What will happen?"
enakk8,SuicideWatch,Does anyone else ever think to themselves “any day now I’m going to kill myself”,I just feel like I’m constantly on some sort of pin and needle. Just no way in hell I can survive anymore. Each day is the same boredom and misery. Prison. Let me out. I just don’t see where it’s worth it. I’m not super talented so the creative ability necessary to better myself isn’t there. Self destructive plagues always end up fucking me up
g0dgke,SuicideWatch,I want to kill myself to avoid the future,"Generally speaking, my life isn’t terrible right now. But I know the future is going to be unimaginably painful and it scares the crap out of me. So much so that I’m willing to end it all to avoid it. 

Maybe I’m just overreacting, since what I’m scared of is what pretty much everyone goes through. But I really don’t want responsibility. I hate that the more I age, the more people expect of me. I don’t want to turn 18 and suddenly be an adult, thrown out to the world. There’s so much that will have to be done in my life and I can’t handle it. 

Getting into university, getting a job, a drivers licence, hell even just the idea of having to get groceries... it all scares me. I feel like everything is happening too fast. 

I hate that this problem isn’t something I can just fix. It will never “get better” because what troubles me is life itself. How am I supposed to fix the fact that I’m too anxious to live?"
ihhdyn,SuicideWatch,Please someone just notice this,"I’m so tired of almost constantly crying and being angry and sad at everything

I feel so alone, I’ve lost everyone and everything over time and I’ve got no goals

Nothing makes me happy anymore

I don’t know if I’m ready to die, I don’t know if I’m ready to stop existing entirely forever and never see the sunlight of day ever again, or ever hear the voice of my friends or remember anything or ever feel happy again even if for a brief moment

But I’m in constant agony and I wish this would just end

Life for me is this endless cycle of misery and sadness and for the past year it just doesn’t end. Ever.

Thank you for your support. I’m sorry...


Edit to Add:
Thank you for your support. My therapist deserves the time off (particularly from me) but is such a compassionate man, he has offered/insisted to still see me if I need to none the less but I’ll be damned if I’m going to bother him when he is so accomodating to me and always makes time to see me whenever I need. He is not the problem. 

I am taking this opportunity away from him while I will feel zero guilt and getting it “done” to stop this neverending hell of isolation, loneliness, severe depression, and zero social support likely to go on for another YEAR due to Covid. I had pretty severe issues pre-pandemic also.

I appreciate ever one of your comments, *all of you* who took time to say anything at all... I know many of you are in the same boat. I hooe you can all join together during this time to help each other. You are all the best.

I’ve reached a point of no return and uncovered levels of hopelessness I never knew possible. I’m unable to communicate directly with people at all at this point, I have not spoken to anyone except my therapist (also my psychiatrist) since March due to trust issues.

This sub has been so amazing and it continues to be. I’m sorry to disappoint, I just can’t...

I was recorded the one time I wasn't putting on a front, pretending I had my shit together head held up high. Maybe it's his fucked up way of trying to motivate me to sort my shit out but it just makes me wish I could stop existing. I fucking hate myself more.

There has been attempts before in the past, but never too serious to the point where I needed to be hospitalized. Once saw a post that said, ""Can I have a 30 day free trial of being dead?"" Never related to something so much in my damn life. Let me be an accident, not to the point where I die, but maybe in a coma for a while. Just to escape. 

I'm the friend that no ones wants to hang out with. I don't have anybody. I made a bad reputation for myself in high school and college (mainly just rumor-based) and I never bounced back from it because of my anxiety. I don't know who I am. I don't know what love is. Being suicidal is the only feeling I truly and wholeheartedly know, which is both comforting and petrifying at the same time. 

Lord forgive me, I'm going to need it. "
lcgyws,SuicideWatch,depression has given me brain damage," 

God i hope im not alone in what im experiencing. Im completely rock bottom now

I swear this severe and constant depression has destroyed all my brain cells. God, i cant even begin to express how fucking moronic i am- ive zero common sense, absolutely no critical thinking skills. Im not joking, my mind is blank 100% of the time and i cant even reason or use critical thinking. Im just really dumb.

I struggle to grasp obvious jokes and sarcasm/satire goes over my head. Jesus, im just not thinking at all, i cant think whatsoever- my brain is super slow.... I LITERALLY DONT KNOW OR UNDERSTAND ANYTHING; i am completely divorced from reality.

I cant even put forth a proper argument- ALL I HAVE EVER BEEN CAPABLE OF IS RECYCLING THE SAME ARGUMENTS LIKE A BROKEN RECORD- i literally canmot think, im a fucking vegetable.

My brain has deteriorated soo much that i dont know even basic shit; i cant do mental arithmetic anymore. I dont know what capitalism meams.... literally... absolutely nothing, no knowledge.

I JUST CANT THINK

kwx100,SuicideWatch,I don't bother telling anyone in my life that I'm suicidal anymore.,"I've wanted to end it since I was like 5. at 25, IDK if this is ever going to go away. But frankly, it isn't fair for me to put it on my friends and family every time I want to end it all. The thing is, I want to end it MOST of the time, so it ends up just being emotional manipulation when I tell them. As in, I wanna kill myself most days, but I only ever brought it up when I wanted attention and affection and people didn't want to give it. I've ruined plenty a relationship and friendship that way, no sense in doing it again. It makes them so sad, and hurt, and afraid when I tell them, and usually they can't do anything anyway. Plus, I don't think I'll really do it anyway... so might as well just reach out to random internet strangers."
komu9e,SuicideWatch,I hate my rapist controlling my life.,"I was raped and forcibly impregnated by a much older man. My family pushed me into marrying the guy because I was no longer a virgin and he came from a good family.

So I dropped out of school, married and had a daughter. I started realizing as she developed that I was teaching her staying in an abusive relationship was not just okay, but what a ""responsible"" adult does. That's what my mom has always told me- that the responsible thing to do is work things out and keep my family together.

But she wasn't the one being routinely forced into sex. She wasn't raped one week after giving birth to ""prove"" she wasn't thinking about a different man. 

I tried to leave him so many times. It was always bad. Somehow I finally clawed my way out in one piece, but he's refusing to cooperate in the divorce.

I got a shit attorney that won't file any motions on my behalf to force action from him. He was served six months ago but has refused to respond with his financials. 

My attorney drained my several thousand dollar deposit.

The ex-husband allowed squatters to move in to a house I bought before we were married (with my aunt's help) and now in order to sell, I must spend thousands in eviction court.

He's also taken my tax refund despite me making twice as much as him up until Covid, when he lost his job and I was forced to take a job at half my previous pay.

I'm drowning in debt because mortgages + childcare leaves me a few hundred to live off and support my daughter with.

He's threatened to disappear with my daughter and said he will not agree to anything in the divorce to make it expensive.

My daughter witnessed an altercation this summer that I don't remember, but she said he was on top of me hurting me. He called an ambulance for me a few months ago and I couldn't remember the context but I think it must have been that. I suspect the ambulance was to make sure I didn't die from what he'd done. the hospital recently said I complained of severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and suspected a burst appendix. But on my bill was a doctor who's a neurologist. 

A few days after returning home I took my daughter to her primary doctor. He noticed one of my eyes was dilated strangely and urged me to go to seek medical attention. I was so certain I would have remembered if something had happened. So I didn't.

This fall, my daughter broke down about abuse she encountered while visiting at her dad's. She told school. Me. Her babysitter. We all contacted CPS. CPS said it was a co parenting issue and my daughter was confused. During this, my daughter also told me about what he had done to me.

My house has a flooded basement. I can walk down there still, but it'll cost 13k to amend the issue and an additional 4k in mold remediation.

My job is going terribly. I can't focus, and therefore can't hit any of my goals. I'm not productive but if I lose my job I have no safety net.

I feel trapped. As long as I live I will always have to see that man. He will always be an influence in my daughter's life. He stole from me the escape of suicide because regardless of how she came to be, I love my daughter. I didn't protect myself from her dad. And now she suffers for that.

Sometimes I think that if I died, at least my life insurance policy would take care of the mortgages and maybe he would change. Maybe he'd be inspired to be a good dad to her. Or maybe since she'd no longer be useful as a means to manipulate me, he would relinquish custody to my aunt (a wonderful and good person). Maybe dying would be the best kindness I could offer my daughter and would free me from existing. It's so exhausting to exist. I'm tired. I just want to sleep.

Edit: it was a long night but thank you for all of the comments and notes of support. I'm in New York. My parents are very devout Christians. I tried to be, but ""you're worthless without your virginity so marry the guy who violently stole it"" was the final nail in the coffin of my religious life. 

I am in counseling, although I don't find it to be effective. I make too much money to qualify for assistance. Last time I checked 32k is the poverty limit for two despite the fact that it barely covers rent in much of NY.

I feel better today. You internet strangers seemed to really help, so thank you. To be honest I thought I'd be shouting my suicidal wishes into a black void. I'm grateful for the connection.

I asked my (shit) attorney about a restraining order. He said without me lying in a pool of blood or with eye witnesses older than my daughter, it was a lost cause and could further incite him. ""Pool of blood"" comment was word for word. Like, thanks for your professionalism man. I'll really sleep soundly tonight knowing you and the state of NY value my well being so much."
l7t135,SuicideWatch,My parents shouldn't have given birth to me,"My parents clearly dont know shit about raising a child right. Cant get a job, cant survive school, and having lots of issues with my mental health, and its all because of how my entire family has treated me since I was young. They have done even more fucked up shit in the past as well but Im not gonna mention here in this post. Im such a fucking mess right now. No one in my family gives a single shit about my mental illness, even after my suicide attempt. My parents will just be shouting and screaming at me and be like ""oh, just suck it up!"" or ""stop being so sensitive and anxious"". Like jesus christ just stfu.

Im currently seeing a psychiatrist and he has been pretty okay I guess, but during our last session he told me that he doesnt really know how to help me anymore because of my parents are always taking away my meds and not believing anything what my psychiatrist said. He just told me to just go for counselling, but i really dont think its that helpful so far.

I really wish i was dead, this is just too painful"
euag3u,SuicideWatch,Anyone else feels like a burden to their friends?,"I feel like my only friend is tired of me. Honestly? I don't blame her. Dealing with a miserable fuck like me must be pretty tiring. Whenever I bring up the fact that I don't feel good or try to share something personal it almost feels as if she wants to tell me to fuck off lol I feel bad saying all this, she means a lot to me and I'm sure she means well but.. damn I feel really lonely and alone with my problems. Maybe I'm just whiny and selfish but sometimes I want more than ""Don't think about it, others have it worse"". Sometimes I feel like I'm the problem and just pretend that everything is okay so she won't get uncomfortable around me. Is it selfish to feel this way? I feel really alone."

cwio6u,SuicideWatch,"My name is Tyler, that’s my real name this is my only account, I’m highly suicidal, have been since I was about 6-7 years old, I’m 26 now and it’s different now. I’m going to tell you my story in a new attempt to gain enough relief to fall asleep tonight. Thanks for reading if you do <3","
Growing up, I was always a really weird kid. I distinctly remember that I had just seen the world differently. It seemed that my imagination had a bigger play in my life than most. Me and a friend in kind garden would squeeze batteries in our hands and pretend that we were Mario or Pokémon because neither of our families could/would buy us a game console but we were exposed to them by relatives and tv. It was so simple back then and looking back so pure,  but it felt like we were there. We didn’t have what other kids had to have fun so we became those things. As far as I know I was a decent enough kid however when my brother came along around age 4, we would fight, I would hurt him, not bad (typically young brother bs) but still enough to get beaten from my father when he got off work. My father more so was (he is still with us) a rigid, traditionally Hispanic in parenting, angry, regretful person. When he was in the house there was always a strange energy of danger even if nothing was going on. It was better to just stay quiet. This didn’t really work because my younger brother soon learned that it was an easy win when we’d bicker to just cry out loud, our dad would come in, beat my ass and I would curse my brothers name for doing so but alas it would get me to stop. My real last memory of child abuse before my teens is about 15 seconds of my dad putting me in a corner on the ground, telling me if I wanted to fight to put my hands up and when I did to just shield myself he pummeled me with closed fists. I was around 10 years old, maybe give or take a couple years, not sure, I have terrible memory of most my life. As I got older, my brother and I actually started bonding, he liked the way I started standing up to our dad no matter how bad I was beat down. He’s told me i inspired him. My mom btw is/was awesome, but didn’t really do much except yell to stop from the sidelines or leave the room since she couldn’t bear to watch. I can’t blame her, not much negativity felt towards her for I know she unconditionally loves me and that must’ve been a tough and traumatic experience for her as well. Moving forward, I’m a decent student, normally averaging around low A’s my brothers straight A’s if not 100’s, not much of a big deal there, my mom started adding incentives once we grew into our early teens (for every A we got in a semester she’d give us like 10 dollars or something, it was dope so we did well). Through out life I feel like I found connections that I would replace for my fathers love, through friendship. I grew very close and desperately wanted to fit in with my friends. I would spend hours out of the house riding bikes around the neighborhood doing dumb lil kid shit, but it was a really freeing time out I remember. Fast forward, around when I was 14, my brother 11 my mom bought me a bass guitar because I had been getting into random enough Japanese rock from the anime I would watch and to me the bassist was always the most bad ass and going crazy member, my brother came along and she bought him a guitar spur of the moment, figured it would help us bond. It did. It really did and I thank everything in this world for those times that followed because they were hands down the best years of my life. I was a shitty bassist and soon transitioned over to wanting to be a singer and my brother excelled at guitar, going onto be called a prodigy by everyone from teachers, producers and most of the respected music industry people we would eventually encounter. But at the time he was my little brother and being a fresh teen thought it would be wack to have my 11 year old brother in the band. I started a couple bands, the second one introducing my brother in as lead guitar. This was a turning point.

Back to family life, my dad started to realize he was aging and I was starting to gain my testosterone fueled teenage body, this didn’t stop anything, but only extended our fights into actual fights. My dad, a correction officer, doing manual labor his whole life handed my ass to me every time. All while telling me to kill myself and how no one loved me and I was a mistake. Nothing like this was said to my brother, unless in terms of how I’ve manipulated him into becoming just like me. I became a bit of a shitty protector of the house hold, two accounts stick out immeasurably to me. The first being (funny kind of a call back to how my brother would yell for my dad to come) my brother was upstairs and screamed Tyler help dad just hit me. In a blind fury, i bum rushed my dad onto the floor, commanded my brother to hold his arms down and pummeled him in his face, chest, balls, anywhere i could hit before he brother free all while yelling the likes of “it used to just be me, that’s where you should’ve left it”. It was a powerful moment. My father spent the rest of the week walking downstairs like a caged tiger screaming and laughing about how he was going to kill me. ‘‘Twas still a sweet victory. No fear.

I’ll speed up the rest: me and my bro made a band, everyone betrayed us, we made another and took full control of who was in it, wrote all the music, what we looked like, who we recorded with, and what not. With his help i created a two year plan to get signed to a label called Fearless Records. We played metal. It was therapeutic and empowering stuff to play after everything you’ve read thus far. 

We did it in four months.

I got a text by our newly acquired manager that we had been offered a deal by the label of our dreams. I cried and got sent home early. A record that I wrote all the lyrics to and my brother wrote all the music to, all fueled by the hate and distinction of our father son dissonance. It was the biggest victory a small town probably has seen, at least our small town. Every time he said we were garbage, we should try something else, i couldn’t sing and my brother should play something nice. Every time he laid a hand on us, put into songs and we did it in four months! Still makes me proud to this day man. 

Btw, this isn’t a story about my father.
He is not the reason I want to kill myself anymore.

The label fucked us over, made us record 3 different records each time hating something that they previously wanted and we called it quits. Our deal was good n no need to recoup anything, just disband.

This is where whatever is inside me to this day was brought into this life. A foe I don’t know if I can beat this time. Throughout the story so far, I had a flame inside of me. The whole time a purpose to prove. A will to fight. I always told people that I wasn’t sad, I was angry. And the anger forged who I was. A determined, skill ful musician, with the mane of a lion and the attitude to match, a man who did it. But when that all went away. I became a worm, but not yet.

Shit with my dad cooled off, he retired. I’m assuming his job really was the culprit of the aggression and I stopped holding the past against him. At this point I had been a dumbass at points too and figured it was not worth the energy or the negativity of keeping that cloud around. Was he still an incredibly ill informed, ego centric prick? Yeah, but I was a different person now and couldn’t be bothered with it. Most times shrugging off his comments. I had worth now.

Me and my bro made another band with just our drummer from the previously signed act, but it didn’t last long, we did an all over the place EP that was uninspiring yet everyone we showed loved it. Drummer left, became a solo artist, he’s a whole other story. I can’t help but feel as tho I’m responsible for his and my brothers mental state as I’m 3-4 years older than both of them (i was always the dad figure to them).

Fuck it tho, rock n roll, we did it once we’ll do it again. Me and my brother move to Los Angeles California in hopes of creating a new sound within the fusion realm of rap, emo, metal, and pop genres. We moved with two of my friends from NY and got a shitty two bedroom apartment and split the rooms. The other two room mates were supposedly friends for years yet fought constantly, shit talked each other and created this crazy negative space in this 1000 sqft. It was not comfortable to say the least. However the one room mate in specific, targeted my brother, who at this point basically didn’t talk to either of them. (This is point one and point 2 is my confesssion) And then there was me, i had developed an alcohol problem, not that i drank every day or even every weekend. But when i did, i became a different person, i would usuallly drink myself to sleep as well. My brother picked me up from a bar one night and while on his way i began to get robbed. I refused it and tried to buy time and ended up running to his car when he got there. Amped on on about 10 jack n cokes and the adrenaline of potentially dying, i flipped shit on my brother. Cursing him out, saying i didn’t need him, i could pay someone 20 dollars to do what he does, etc. it was awful. And it was the last straw for him. Within the next week or so he packed up, quit his job and went back home. 

I was heartbroken, but covered it up with anger. My other two room mates, if you can believe it, convinced me that i didn’t need him and that he held me back. I thought I’d be okay and he’d come back, i left our room exactly how he left it for months. He didn’t. 

This was the final nail in the coffin for my mental state to date. I spend every night analyzing the past, and i think I’ve learned that at first i created a whole identity to hating my father, then after that i created a whole identity around me and my brothers music career and once he was gone and to this second of typing it, I’m lost. I don’t know what to do. My personality feels like it’s splitting. Some days I’m this really cool extroverted ladies man guy and some days I’m a worm in my bed spending money he doesn’t have on post mates so he doesn’t have to leave the apartment. When i sit down and try to write music, i can, but i don’t feel it anymore. It’s the only skill i have. I didn’t go to a real college because of the deal, I’m not good at anything and I’m not interested in anything other than music. But there’s no inspiration left in me. Nothing really makes me happy anymore. I had a gf, nothing, broke up with her, nothing i have a new one, i miss her sometimes but for the most part nothing, i have written 6 new songs, nothing, i post a photo on Instagram, nothing, i go to work, nothing, i watch a movie, nothing. Everything just seems so pointless now, i don’t see myself as the star i once did. I don’t even believe myself when i sing, or have conversation with people. It’s like I’m watching the most boring movie about someone that i just don’t even care about. I just want him to die. I just want to stop wondering and working and fighting, i don’t want to do it anymore, and i was the relief of death. 

Idk what i expect from this but it was slightly therapeutic, thanks for listening."
k512jt,SuicideWatch,I want to kill myself more than anything but I can’t;(,I can not go a single day where suicide doesn’t cross my mind. Sometimes I think about it just to give myself comfort. The thought of just ending it all and not having to deal with any of this ever again gives me unbelievable comfort. But I have a very loving family who would be heartbroken and I can’t do that to them. If my entire family died tonight I would kill myself first thing in the morning. My life is constant sadness and I hate myself I just want to end it all. Sometimes at work when I literally will think about suicide just to make the time go by faster:( does anyone else have the thought in the very back of their mind that their mom/family would just die so you can kill yourself without hurting them?

hikm53,SuicideWatch,the plan,"you take a nice shower. you put on your comfiest sweater and fuzzy socks. it’s the middle of the night, nice and dark and quiet. ideally it’s raining. you prepare your favourite meal. eat until you feel just right. pet the kitties goodbye... they were always there for you. dont cry. they will be loved by your relatives or other kind people of this world. 

you wrote out a note explaining everything. hand written, over and over. hell, it’ll never say it all but it gets the point across. they will get a glimpse into what you were thinking. no more frantic late night texts. no more of them pretending to care. no more troubling the ones you love the most. they’ll be sad at first but in time they’ll remember all the good things about you and thats what they’ll say... she was so sweet. her heart was too big for this world. she had so much potential. we all loved her so much. 

so you’ll tuck into bed, knowing all that. you’ll finally feel at peace. thankful. it’s over. no more pain. get extra comfy, cover up. put the gun to your head and pull the trigger. 

then perfect, sweet, sleep and silence forever. the only true thing that lasts forever in this world. death."
iw41dk,SuicideWatch,I don't care if I'm loved if i can't feel it.,"What if someone kept feeding you sugar or something saying it was good and so sweet and glorious but you had a phsyical issue that negated your sense of tasting sweetness? You never tasted the good, just the grainy painful shit like sand that never nourished.

That's how I feel when people say ""don't go, you are loved.""

I know I'm loved.

I know its sugar.

I can't feel it.

I can't taste it.

The only reason I stay alive when people say ""you are loved"" is GUILT. Isn't that fucked up? You're guilting me into suffering more because that makes you happy somehow? Either find a reason that makes sense to my brain or turn your back and let me fucking die already!"
81zuxe,SuicideWatch,Attempt failed. Currently in the hospital.,"I tried I really did, but the second I took the pills I instantly regretted it. I called 911. In the ambulance is when I really noticed what I had done. And having the paramedics there to calm me down and help me was everything to me. I'm currently in the hospital. I can't leave my room unless it's to go to the bathroom. I can't even close my curtain to get privacy. They took every single cable and metal object out of the room. I'm in terrible pain. I didn't sleep at all last night. Hospital beds are the worse. I miss my bed and my dog :( 

Despite the dreary scene of the hospital the nurses and doctors have been nothing but nice and supportive. The nurse who drew my blood even drew a little smiley face on my bandaid to cheer me up a little. One nurse even gave me her number in case I ever need some support. I've never been treated so nicely by a group of strangers. Every single one of them giving me a different purpose to live. Thankfully I didn't ingest too much pills to damage my body too much. Just slight kinda damage but nothing life threatening. 

But this has made me realize a lot. Life really is worth living. No matter your situation. There are PLENTY of people who can be there for you. Every single nurse and doctor here gave me thousands of resources to help me. And this has given me the will to live. 

I should be getting out by Tuesday when a psychiatrist comes to mentally evaluate me and give me permission to leave. Until then I'm in a hospital room prison being watched over like a baby but it's good to know that there's people out there who truly care. 

To all the people considering suicide. Please don't do it. It's not worth it. I truly thought I had no one and my family wouldn't care. But seeing their crying faces when the ambulance took me away made me realize that even when you think you have no one you're wrong. The selfish decision I made will be in my mind forever but it gives me a reason to go on. We're all strong enough if we really try. 

Stay strong and reconsider your choice. 


EDIT: I didn't think my post would get so much attention, seeing as my other posts wouldn't get much. I'm sorry if I can't reply to all of the comments it's really a lot! However, thank you to all the kind people and positive messages. I'm glad to see my story is helping others as well. "
i9a0a8,SuicideWatch,Suicide is not irrational at all,"Every day that I’m alive, I suffer

And who cares? Genuinely who cares? I've come on here just to rant and I'd bet any amount of money you who's reading this did the exact same. Everyone is self absorbed, the only people who care about you (if any) can't help. They have their own lives to live. They beg people with depression and who are suicidal to ""talk"" well who do we fucking talk to? I don't have the money for a fancy fucking therapist, I honestly don't just feel sorry for myself right now.. I feel sorry for mankind. Do you think in a tribe if someone is crying they walk past them and pretend they didn't see them? For whatever reason this 21st century, though being the safest and most peaceful time in all of history. Is also some on the most uncaring, sociopathic fucked up times in history. Well... maybe not. Maybe the world has always been fucked and we just have selective memory. 

No-one cares about you, no-one cares about me. I wish I could look out the window and see a fucking meteorite screeching towards Earth. I'm done, I really don't know how I am going to get through Christmas this year so I might as well leave a trail so my family don't blame themselves if I do something. I doubt I will, I'm a pussy and too scared. So I'll just sit in my misery, watch another year come and wonder how I will survive this new year coming."
c9o27b,SuicideWatch,"UPDATE THANK YOU, EVERYONE,​ WHO PUSHED ME TO LIVE!!!!!!!", THANK YOU EVERYONE WHO HELPED!!!!!!!! so after posting this 28 days ago I wrote my Best friend who's out of state a suicide note and I closed my phone and social media and popped some pills and right then there was a knock at my door and it was the cops they took me to a psychiatric ward were I spent a few days a little over a week it felt like a month but I swear I meet some amazing people and my family and friends visited every day and now I'm on my medication and things are turning around a lot!!!!!! I'm moving out to my Best friend and taking a semester off to recoup from school I explained to my friend about the 1k and she wasn't sweating it she said my life was more important but long story short everything worked out I love you strangers and thank you for helping me\^\_\^!xoxoxox
itczgq,SuicideWatch,I am back :(,"it’s me again. hello. i (17f) tried to ask my mom for therapy and she basically used money as a reason not to do it and screamed at me saying i had no reason to be depressed because i have no responsibilities or children. she then went on to say that only stupid people commit suicide and that i must be “very free” if i can “afford” to be depressed all the time. she said a bunch of horrible stuff after that and it ended up with her being the victim (she said i was making her feel like a bad mother by being suicidal, which honestly she is) and crying and me being left alone to deal with everything by myself. 

i think i just kind of need comfort right now idk what to do anymore. i at least hoped my mother would care enough about my mental health to send me to therapy but i was once again proven wrong"

fhzr9a,SuicideWatch,found and performed cpr on dead friend/looking for help,"I found my best friend dead from hanging herself just under 3 weeks ago now, I called the ambulance and untied her and gave her CPR for 12-14 minutes before anyone showed up. They ended up working on her for 60-90 minutes and got a faint heart beat back and she was put into an induced coma. I had to call her boyfriend and ex/best friend and we all spent the night in the ICU. I spent a week in shock, meeting her parents who flew in from interstate. Her father thanked me for giving them the opportunity to say goodbye to her. For the first  6 days it seemed there was such a low chance of her making any kind of recovery that we were just waiting for her family to decide to withdraw life support. I had begun grieving, although I was by her bed most days and evenings brushing her hair talking to her and reading to her from our favorite poetry books. On about day 6/7 they decided to take her off sedation and see what would happen and she ended up opening her eyes in front of me for the first time. It was a miracle, and it was also the saddest part reflectively of the entire experience. All she could do was lay and sob. I spent a few days with her like this. I would talk to her and I knew she could hear me because there would be certain things she would cry about and then certain things I would say would calm her back down. It was so incredibly painful. I was convinced over these days I had ruined her life by doing what I did. She was dead when I found her and that I had brought her back to a life of hell. It was my worst fear that she would stay in that state forever, I just couldn’t wrap my head around how incredibly unjust that would be. She ended up within 24 hours of having her breathing tube taken out and her sedation completely ceased able to start breathing on her own, speaking a little and even started moving. It’s all been so surreal. Now that shock has worn off I’m having constant flash backs and panic attacks. I have constant invasive thoughts of killing my self. It’s so painful. I truly want to die, I feel so conflicted and invisible. Because she is recovering our mutual friends almost have forgotten just how traumatic this experience has been for her first and foremost (and realistically this is only just the beginning of a very painful road for her...) and traumatised I am from finding her, untying her, giving her cpr while I knew she was dead, cleaning the blood off the door she was hanging from, and spending 2 straight weeks by her side through every single state in ICU. I even moisturised her arms and legs so her scars would heal properly because nobody was doing it for her. I’m so heart broken. I want to die. I feel invisible and I don’t know where to put my pain. I have nobody because it’s too heavy for anyone to deal with, and all our mutual friends just want to focus on the positives that she is recovering which I understand but it’s like they don’t understand that she hung herself. I’m traumatised for life, and her life is changed for ever even if she does make a full recovery which who knows—she’s still very brain damaged and doesn’t even know what’s happened to Her. I have never posted before, I don’t know anyone who’s had any kind of similar experience. It’s so layered and I have a 11 year history of self harm and drug use, both of which I had recovered from, years since I have self harmed and 3 months since I have used drugs or alcohol, but all I want to do is hurt myself in anyway I can.

Edit: she had hung herself on the back of her door, so by opening her bedroom door that’s how she was released from hanging. I called 000 immediately as I untied the belt from her neck and checked if she was breathing or had a heart beat. All I did was find her and untie her and try wake her up realise she was very obviously dead/not conscious and call 000 and then do what they told me to until anyone arrived because I was in so much shock I was just doing what they were telling me to, even when the woman was like you need to somehow get into that room and I had to kick her desk back and squeeze my way into her bedroom I had no idea why the woman was saying she needed to be laid out flat on her back until all of a sudden the woman was telling me to give her mouth to mouth then I realised I was about to do CPR. I was screaming and crying why are you making me do this she’s dead the entire time and the woman just kept saying I know *my name* but just keep helping her until help gets there. So I did"
kxu41c,SuicideWatch,Being disabled has ruined my life,"I’m pretty badly autistic, I have dyspraxia/dyslexia/dyscalculia, I have ADHD, I got the neurological full house when I was born it seems. My parents (divorced and separated) used to abuse me (independently of one another as they didn’t talk), it got to the point where my mom was trying to murder me for quite a while. This left me severely mentally I’ll. Boarderline personality disorder, skitzo-affective disorder, bipolar 1, and C-PTSD. I’ve been assessed 3 times so each doctor has a slightly different opinion, but those are the words they chose to diagnose me with. Irregardless of what they say, the symptoms are absolute hell. Delusions, rapid violent mood swings, auditory and visual hallucinations, I hear voices, fully immersive flash backs of my trauma, break downs, anxiety attacks, self-harm (I do it automatically in my sleep), night terrors, lack of self-control, black outs, lack of impulse control. I could go on. It has crippled my life. I have no job. No family. No friends. I have my dog and a collection of ant colonies. What kind of life is this? What kind of future do I have waiting for me? I get worse every year, how long does my mind have left? Will I ever find love? Will I ever have friends? I just don’t know. I don’t want to die, I just don’t want to be trapped inside of this system anymore. I worry that one day I won’t even be aware I’ve killed myself because I won’t have been present during the moment that event carries out. It’s a very strange fear to have to carry around - looking over your shoulder, looking for yourself. Some times I think death would be a mercy. I just don’t know what the future holds, all I know is that I’m trying. I’m trying to be a good person. I’m trying to be likeable. I’m trying to be funny. I’m trying to be loveable. I’m trying to be human. I’m trying to make something of myself. I just wish that I hadn’t been given Mt. Everest on my first Rodeo. 

Thank you for reading this, if you bothered to make it this far that is. I appreciate it. This was very cathartic."

gwxvkc,SuicideWatch,I’ve started wishing that I would randomly die of a natural cause in order to avoid suicide.,"Over the past month leading into June has been the worst its been in a while. Almost anything has sent me into the thoughts of killing myself. About two years ago I used to cut to deal with this but i stopped and have been clean since. I still sometimes drag slightly sharp items across my skin but never enough to cut or leave a mark. Now suicide is an every day thought in my head even on good days. Im a minor and not allowed to seek treatment or medicine. I firmly believe that when I go it will be due to my own hand. Whenever I get sick or feel pains that are abnormal, I no longer tell anyone in hope that it’ll kill me before I do and that my family and friends will have me dead due to something medical and not suicide. I don’t know what I believe in but I have even found myself praying to have a stroke or a heart attack just to end it all or praying to fall asleep and not wake up. I don’t know what to do anymore. Im struggling to live."
ikl28m,SuicideWatch,My mom is screaming about how she wish I was never born downstairs,"The past few days have been an absolute nightmare. My aunt (my mom's sister) is visiting the week or so, and she rarely visits because of how far away she lives. She's super rich and difficult to please, and my family isn't terribly poor but we're low income and a wreck. 

I recently went to the doctor for my mental health issues, I never tell them I'm suicidal because I know what'll happen if I even mention suicidal thoughts. I've been on two different medications for the past few months and neither of them seem to produce any affect. 

My sister who used to abuse me severely as a kid came over the other day, we're both adults now and I think we get along okay, I never really talk to her. Shes kind of psychotic and paranoid beyond fuck, I think she may have schizophrenia or something fucked. But she came in and she said to me, ""OK OP WE ALL KNOW I DID TERRIBLE STUFF TO YOU AS A KID BUT IF YOU COULD PLEASE STOP TELLING EVERYONE ABOUT IT THAT WOULD BE COOL. STOP MAKING ME FEEL LIKE SHIT."" And she went on and on about how I was telling everyone just to turn on her and what not. When I do open up about what she did to me as a kid, in the rare times that I do, I only mention things really briefly and I never say things like, ""she did this horrible thing now go attack her about it."" I just say what happened and that's it. My dad was sitting in the room, and my dad has older siblings and she was like, ""DAD YOU HAVE OLDER SIBLINGS, IM SURE THEY DID SHITTY THINGS TO YOU AS A KID, BUT YOU NEVER WENT OUT OF YOUR WAY TO MAKE THEM FEEL LIKE SHIT ABOUT IT."" 

Now to top it all off, its my mom's birthday today. And the house is a wreck as usual because she refuses to ever clean. I stay in my room 24/7 and never really clean down there because none of it is my mess, its 90% my mom's own messes, mixed with kids. And my dad came in this morning and woke me up and said, ""do you think you could help mom clean today? It's her birthday."" And I said yeah, and went back to sleep cause it's still morning and we have all day. I was awoken by my mom downstairs at 8 am screeching demonically and throwing stuff and screaming about how much she hates her life, she hates the kids, she hates that I'm a loser who stays in her room all day, she wished I was never born, and a lot of other hurtful and hateful things.

If I didnt have more of a reason to end my life then idk what would be. 

I'm scared to go down there, I was gonna help her clean today but I really dont want to now, birthday or not. 

I'm not sure what I'm gonna do. I havent cut myself in a long time and it is really tempting right now to brutally injure myself and or kill myself. I wish we had a gun."

I always end up in the same place. I am alone and unloved. The only thing keeping me here was the one person who loved me. I’ve reached out to everyone I thought would care if I died.

Not developing social skills...

Being socially inept as an adult

l3xiex,SuicideWatch,My gf made an attempt,"She has had the toughest life of anyone I've ever known, and yet she's the kindest, most loving person I've ever known. We fit together in so many ways we've never come close to before. We make each other feel normal when the rest of the world does the opposite.

Recently, her anxiety skyrocketed, and she had been a bit more receptive to discussing getting some help (past trauma included incidents related to therapy and psych treatment). I asked again Wednesday night when she started getting antsy again after a calm, positive day. She said she would ""get there,"" she would be ready soon.

Her anxiety spiked a little later that night, and she got upset with me over a very minor misunderstanding. It threw me at first, but I realized it was her anxiety talking and did what I could to help her calm down. The anxiety didn't seem as bad at it had been in nights leading up to that.

We snuggled up in bed and went to sleep. I woke up in the night and noticed she was very tightly holding onto me. She didn't move much when I got up, just kinda rolled over. Same thing when I came back to bed.

I got up for work later, and she apologized for being mean the night before. I apologized for not realizing what was going on at first. Nothing seemed amiss, but she's tough, and mornings are hectic.

She sent the usual sweet message while I was on my way in. Then right after my work day started (and she knew I couldn't get messages for a while), she messaged that she needed to be committed. When I got the message, I asked if she was in danger and messaged our trusted friends near the house. She had reached out to them already, and they were there.

They took her to the ER, she went from there to inpatient.

She took 2500 mg of benadryl. I'm not sure how she woke up. She didn't mean to wake up.

The misunderstanding and everything happened later the night before, and she took the pills before that.

Anyway. She has been receiving inpatient treatment for a couple days. She just got cleared to receive the clothes I dropped off her first night in there. She got a fork at dinner tonight.

We've been able to talk a handful of times. She sounds better and more hopeful each time. I'm so proud of her for finally agreeing to get the help she needs, and I cannot fathom how hard this is for her.

Due to COVID restrictions, no one can have visitors, so she has short phone calls, and she has the photos and books I dropped off. And she has time. She is doing the work and going to sessions and everything (confirmed by her nurses). She is feeling hopeful. She said she was really happy about today.

I'm so glad she's getting help. I know she's in good hands. The facility she's at is local, and I have friends who gave family who've been greatly helped by then, too. I'm also feeling lost being less than a mile from her but unable to give her a hug or even look into her eyes.

We have a small but tight support network of friends, and I don't feel like harming myself. I just don't feel like doing anything other than calling her. 

Sorry if this is the wrong sub. I looked a bit and couldn't find a better fit, and I needed to get this out there.

Update: I just got word that she's been cleared to come home. She has medications to be picked up at the pharmacy, and she has follow up sessions scheduled.

I can't thank you all enough for the kindness and support you've sent our way here. Each night of this has been rough, but last night felt particularly miry. I posted here because, although I have good friends whom I can talk to admit this, and who came through the other day and got her to help while I was gone, I felt a need to just say the story to people who didn't know, who don't know, what was going on or don't know us, etc.

I am so happy she is coming home, and I am so hopeful for the future. I know the struggle is not over, and it's one that will likely go on as long as we're alive (just like my own struggles with mental health), but I am supremely optimistic at the change in her demeanor and her willingness to continue on the path to health and happiness. Together.

Thank you. As silly as it will seem to some people, your comments, messages, and everything have really helped."

fvd2oi,SuicideWatch,I tried to kill myself but survived and no one knows,"January  8th 2020 I was driving home listening to Amy Winehouse and decided that this was my time. It was on a windy, empty country road, late at night, in torrential rain- accidents happened there all the time. I had just finished having dinner with my housemate at University and was on my way to my hometown to see my family. No one would suspect a thing. I closed my eyes, let go of the steering wheel and put my foot down. 

When I opened my eyes my vision was blurred, but I could see that my windshield had caved in. I proceeded to crawl out across the passenger seat, opening the door with my elbow as hands were covered in shards of glass. There was no shock, no confusion. I felt a small sense of relief that I wasn’t paralysed, and a bigger sense of relief that I hadn‘t hit anyone else. But other than that, I still felt just as dead inside as I had prior to the crash.

I went through the motions. Strangers came to my aid, followed shortly by the paramedics and later my parents. I laughed and smiled through it, cracking jokes about ordering my preferred cocktail of pain relief and apologising for keeping everyone up so late. I had just survived a near fatal car crash and already the guilt and shame of everyone worrying about me was kicking in.

I had aquaplaned across the road, accelerating into a hedge, before flipping my 2004 corsa four times, knocking down a row of silver birches in the process and spinning 20m down the country lane. I had landed upright but the roof of the car had moulded around my headrest. I’m only 5’2”, if I was a couple of inches taller my head would have been caved in. I should have been dead. 

Instead, I spent a week in hospital lying on my back, completely immobilised, awaiting my C7 spinal surgery. Post-surgery, my doctor told me he’d seen MRI scans like mine where the patient had already been paralysed, so I guess the fact that I walked out of hospital after 9 days with Just a neck brace was a silver lining. 

Since then I‘ve carried on keeping up appearances. Things have changed, some for the better, some for the worse. For a while, my frustration that I had survived was outweighed by my relief that I wasn’t paralysed, and in truth that is still the case. But my fear of putting my family through something like that again is starting to wear off. It‘s a constant fight between my happiness and their grief. What’s more important? Should I continue to suffer silently in a world where I feel completely lost and alone, just to postpone their mourning for what will eventually happen anyway?"

But I was to much of a coward and cut it. Some people know like my father but they don't care. I really need a hug. I haven't heard or seen someone familiar in the past 2months. I really grave love, understanding, kidness, a hand, a shoulder. I am so lonely. I don't understand that people don't care what happened yesterday I don't. Am I this bad of a person? U don't think so I'm just mentally unstable. Anyone from Belgium whom wants to be my friend? I don't  want to be pathetic but I'm so lonely I miss love so much. I'm going to stop now I don't want to cry ;) thanks in advance for the people reading this."
hizc1t,SuicideWatch,Killing yourself is selfish.,"That’s what most people would say. But do those people know what you struggle with on a daily basis? How hard it is to get out of bed? How hard it is to look into a mirror? How much pain they have been through? It isn’t fair. I give nothing but love and I get shit in return. I feel as if life isn’t right for me. I know I’d hurt people if I were to die. My mother would be destroyed the most but secretly does she know her child is already dying inside? That her child has no reason, none at all to keep trying. I don’t want to be in pain, but the ones I love the most, hurt me the most. So why keep trying? If I love someone so much to the point where they can hurt me 1,000+ times and I still continue going.. why keep going? They obviously don’t care about me, they love the fact that they’ll never lose me. I don’t want to die. I am just tired of feeling trapped in my mind."
fyxzv9,SuicideWatch,"No one really cares, they're only trying to make themselves feel good.","A while back I removed myself from the contacts of my 'friends,' trying to isolate myself before I stepped in front of a bus. No one spoke to me, ever reached out. I had to initiate every conversation, I was the runt hanging around that no one had the balls to formally tell to fuck off. Of course, the moment I do leave, everyone suddenly cares, everyone is buzzing my phone asking what's up and how I'm doing, they even got a hold of my parents. It escalated at some point to where the only one from that group I had any respect for is on the phone pleading that I don't die, that suicide is irrational and that I should consider meds.

Guess what, I said sure, I won't die, I'll go back business as usual. And you know what, it is business as usual. I am never anyone's first choice, I haven't spoken to another human in over a month. Even when I come back from an attempt it's like I died anyway. Really glad I got talked out of it, it would fucking suck if I missed out on being ignored and forgotten again."
95icab,SuicideWatch,nobody cares if youre suicidal until you actually commit suicide,"I often fantasize about dying. I don't want to be here anymore. it's not even so much out of sadness anymore as it is just out of thinking realistically. there's literally no point. the only thing holding me back from doing it is I don't want to do that to my parents. 
besides feeling like I just want to be dead, I also deal with intense depression and thoughts that torment me. I can't shake the feeling that something is just wrong with me and I'm never going to be happy or deserve to be happy. there's this void in me and no matter what I do, nothing fills it. 

I tried talking to my ex about this while we were dating. I told him about my self harm and how I just want to die. about the self harm, he told me to cut the ""right way"" if I wanted real results. for the depression and suicidal thoughts, he said he felt the same except he had a worse life, so his depression was more justified. he said I have a lot to be happy for. 

it just made me want to kill myself even more. but the thing is, I don't think I want to die. I just wish everything would stop and I could start over as someone else. 
and honestly, when I think about killing myself, I fantasize about it not working, but working just enough to hospitalize me. it's a sick fucking thought, I know.
I think the main reason I want to attempt suicide is so the people around me will realize that I'm not just faking it or ""choosing"" to be depressed. it's not just for attention... which is ironic to say, considering I want to do it literally to get their attention. but I just feel like, in order for my pain to be taken seriously, I need to show it to people somehow."

I will either drink myself to death or jump off a bridge before my 50th birthday.   When I think about my fate, I am comforted.  I don't have to live in my personal hell if I don't want to.  Knowing I can end things on my terms whenever I decide brings relief.

hsjdld,SuicideWatch,Update,"2 days ago I had all the necessary ""equipment"" gathered and felt so ready for my exit. I was sitting on the pier watching people in the afternoon, taking it all in, mentally saying goodbye essentially. There was a man playing with his daughter nearby, and I remembered the times my dad would play with me in the snow, at the park, and when he explained why the sky was blue and sunsets red, and how his voice trembles when he talks to me now because they're so worried, and how I haven't called him in days because I'm so ashamed of where I am.

I've felt half dead for 15 years and for 15 years my parents guided me to the surface at every step. How can I do that to them and take their only daughter away? There is no way. No fucking way I'll allow those two people suffer like that. 

I called my parents today, picked up my antidepressants from the pharmacy and made conversation with a lovely stranger over ice cream. I'm here, if anyone was wondering. I'm not going anywhere. I forget sometimes when it hurts too bad and it does hurt a lot but I've never stopped loving life. It's just my brain.

&#x200B;

I don't know why I keep writing these. There must have been many who have reached out for help numerous times, having done everything right, putting up a good fight, only to submit to that dark desire. It's not as though people notice when a stranger stops crying out in pain. We expect people to *not* cry out in pain most of the time. That's just how things are normally. It's the chaotic pleas that catch our attention *because* its unexpected. Yet, how many people have the strength, or desire, to tend to those that are suffering? If you ignore someone in pain, you take no responsibility for them unless you're personally called on. We only actively tend to others if there is a reward, or a heightened sense of sympathy.

&#x200B;

I find it common for others to do just enough to keep you from committing suicide, but few do more than that. I don't think we should be babied, but it certainly feels like we get abandoned.

It's common to feed a starving person until they are strong enough, tend to a broken body until they are strong enough, raise a small child until they are strong enough, or even nurture a dying animal until they are strong enough. But not the emotionally damaged.

&#x200B;

So why do I keep writing these? Desperation, probably. I know full well that, even under the banner of ""suicide watch"", most people come here squeezing out their last drops of hope over mounds of despair; taking that last gamble that maybe someone can save them. I'm sure there are a great number of them who never actually commit suicide, but what about those who did? How many messages are on this subreddit that serve as someone's last words? Will this be my final message to the world?

Like I said; I don't think most of us commit suicide *just* to die. We die as a last resort to end our suffering. At the same time, I don't think any of us live just to live. We *want* goals, passions, a sense of belonging, self-worth, feelings of accomplishment. Yet we're told not to die because it's ""better"" to live. Even if that means living in misery.

&#x200B;

It's at this point that I realize I'm only writing for myself. I'd *like* it if someone heard my cry for help, but I'm just another drop in the ocean, aren't I?

I dunno.

&#x200B;

I opened this with the intent on explaining why I feel suicidal. *My* [reason](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/dyj1z0/ive_been_battling_depression_for_nineteen_years/). But I've been repeating myself as it is online and offline.

&#x200B;

If someone *is* reading this, then thank you for at least hearing me out.

If someone is reading this; I'm scared. I'm scared that I won't be able to hold this off anymore. So I'll just imagine that I'm not alone. That maybe this message connects us.

I'll just pretend that someone is reading this. So, just in case I can't hold on, I won't be alone in the end.

I've been suicidal for so long that killing myself has become a potential answer to every problem or question or stressor, an advocate for death in the back of my mind. 
Constantly. Even when I've been in better patches, that part of me still breathes these questions into my mind.

""But what if we just stopped existing?"" 
""Is my existence *really* worthwhile?""
""Does your life have any real meaning?""
""Why are you still alive?""

Healthy brains just don't fucking ask those questions incessantly. They don't have existential crises in response to every little task.

There is something so fundamentally wrong with the building blocks of my psyche that makes me hate myself and have no will to exist, and very little seems to touch that basic flaw in my code. Every action I take is thrown off by it, the eccentricities it causes magnifying until my life is coming apart at the seams."

I must really be repulsive when I offend people whom i don't even know.

Noone would read my suicide note. I don't have a single friend. At 30 years of age I have never been in a relationship. I have no family. Who would read this? 

I've written a suicide note every week for 10 years. But I just can't seem to end myself. I wish I could absorb the illnesses of my patients, like a superpower that lets them go home to their families and lets me die. Maybe I would be remembered as a hero.

I wish someone would read my note. But noone will. I have another meeting with corona in a few hours.

Edit: I am a transgender person, that's why people harass me. I suppose they think I am ugly and repulsive. I dont mind if you call me guy, they call me worse things but I wish I wasn't one.

bgq09m,SuicideWatch,I jumped off a (small) bridge,"Surprise! I lived. The water was quite a bit deeper than I thought, and luckily there were no rocks or tree branches just below the surface. I went headfirst, so any debri would have likely killed me outright, or knocked me out and caused me to drawn. 

I still got a concussion just from the water (FYI, concussions suck. Do not recommend). And after I somehow managed to not drown anyway, I swam to shore. Holy crap was it a long, cold walk home. 

Believe it or not, I didn’t think it was that big a deal. It didn’t really feel like a true suicide attempt. More like it blurred the lines between ‘self harm’ and ‘suicide’. Before the jump I had figured a ~90% chance I’d live if the water was deep (I was gambling a lot on that “if”). 

When I got home I told my family, thinking they would just let me go to sleep with some asprin, maybe take the next day off. Nope. Not a chance. We went *straight* to the ER. Then I was volunteered to go to the inpatient psychiatric unit. 

The psych ward. I was pretty terrified. I didn’t think I was worthy of such care. My issues were mild, weren’t they? It was just (extreme) self harm. 

I spent five days in the hospital. And frankly they were some of the most incredible days I’ve ever experienced in my life. I dealt with both extreme pain and euphoria. At several points, I *was* the hysterical, crying, inconsolable woman who you’d expect to find in a padded room wearing a straight jacket. 

But they didn’t do that to me. They talked to me, and they helped me. They gave me the mental and emotional tools to help myself. Somehow, they got me to admit that I *wanted* to live, even though I desperately believed I didn’t deserve to. I’m trying to remember, every minute of every day, that I *do* deserve to live. 

Anyway... that’s kinda my little story. 

TL;DR: Jumped off a bridge, landed in a psych ward, got legit help.

Edit: wow thanks for the support everyone! I’ll try to answer your questions in more detail when I get a chance.

Edit 2: this got a bit more attention than I thought, but I’m glad. If this enourages even one person to consider asking for help, or joining an inpatient phsyciatric program, I’ll be overjoyed."

&#x200B;

I think it was around 3PM yesterday that I decided to end my life. I'd had a relatively uneventful morning. I'd already been on a walk with my mother down to the lake mentioned in my previous post, in efforts to ease some of the emotional tension that had been building for a couple of days. It didn't help. Cutting myself didn't help. I told her I felt trapped.

It was only after the words passed my lips, in the silence of the woods down by the lake, that I realised such language was a hallmark of the suicidal. Trapped. It almost evoked a grin. I hadn't even figured that suicide was already so deeply entrenched in my brain that it was spilling out into my words. I read an excellent book a few years ago where grief was literally a big black bird. It was as if said bird had landed on my scalp and I'd only just realised that its claws were prodding into my brain. What an image.

Afterwards, I got home. Something had finally cracked. I'm not sure what got pills into my brain, but once I'd locked onto the idea, it seemed an obvious choice. I felt a strange sense of clarity and resolution. I knew that it was dangerous to feel that way, but I enjoyed it. I went out into the garden - it was sunny - put my headphones on and listened to the Smiths. I lay down on the grass and crossed my arms over my eyes. I couldn't see, or hear anything (apart from Morrissey). I wondered if this was what it was like to be dead, to have this feeling of being alive but to lack all senses.

The song finished, and I sat up and opened my eyes. Everything was hazy and blue, in that strange way when you've shut your eyes against the sun for too long. It did feel almost heavenly, sat there in the grass. I felt lighter and cleaner than I had in a long time. As stated previously, I'm not a Christian, or any religion for that matter, but it was there in my garden that I first had this sense of God being with me. Everything was beautiful in a way I had never experienced before. It was as if everything had been prepared for me once last time. I felt at peace.

I sat there in the grass until I was called in for dinner. I ate with my family. I couldn't look them in the eyes once. Sticking with the religious theme, it had the same sense of doom as the Last Supper. I almost laughed. I don't know why.

I went out for another walk after dinner, back to the same lake as earlier. I think it had just gone 8PM, so the road through the woods was very empty, and the sun was just low enough in the sky to give that gorgeous golden tint to everything. I have lived in the same house all my life, so I must have walked this road at least a thousand times, but it was as if I was seeing it fresh. The leaves hanging above me looked so light. I saw that golden arch of trees that I mentioned in my other post, just at the end of the road where the woods thickened. It was as if I was being welcomed home. I felt a strange sense of euphoria as I passed through them, like I'd won some sort of prize. I walked past a couple with their dogs. I smiled and said hello. I wonder what the expression was on my face. Did it look as though I was breaking, or was it peaceful?

I got to the lake and sat down on the bench in front of it. The golden light was just skimming the trees - they're tall. It was entirely quiet. I have never known such quiet. The lake was completely still, except for the little circular ripples from the flies hitting the water. The sky had faded into a quiet greyish blue.  It was about 8:30PM. There was nobody else at the lake.

I knew then, in that stillness, that I wanted to go. In that stillness, I felt that every leaf, every pebble, even the rocks at the bottom of the lake had been placed there for me. I don't know whether it was a last-ditch attempt by the universe to get me to stay, or a send off. Like when Simon dies in Lord of the Flies, and all the little silver creatures come to carry his body away on the tide. I think it was a bit of both. It made me feel happy. 

When people freeze to death, they don't feel cold. They feel warm.

I got up, walked back down the road - and the light was fading, but it was still beautiful - and I got home. I messaged a couple of people that I wanted to say goodbye to, just to wish them well. I got changed into my favourite pajamas. I had a cup of tea - how English of me, to have one last cuppa. (I'd never liked this country.) I hugged my mother goodnight and I told her I loved her. I haven't told her I loved her in a decade.

I got into bed - it must have been around 10:30PM by this point - and I wrote my previous post. I'm not sure what I was looking for, by writing it. I didn't expect anyone to respond. I expected it to be the last mark I left on the world. I was okay with that. I hit post. I got a few replies. I responded. It was 11:50PM, I remember it clearly. I turned off my laptop. I went downstairs to get the pills to kill myself.

I barely remember ripping them from the packet. I don't think I felt anything. I was empty as I lined them up. There were only 8, but I'd done my research. One for each year of my life that I'd felt this way. It was enough to die - I don't weigh much - but I realised that it was also enough for me to live. I didn't feel terrible about that. I had responded to one of the comments on my other post about how I was willing to gamble. I had a bottle of water. I was ready.

It was then that I realised my willingness to take a gamble meant that I might want to live. I sat looking at those pills for a long time. I looked at the clock. It was nearly 1AM. I realised I was tired. And the suicide note I'd left was pretty badly written. And there was a party going on, down the street. I figured that even if I took the pills as an act of self harm, not suicide, I'd still have to call an ambulance, and I didn't particularly want that happening in front of a house full of people.

I laughed. It was almost stupid. I wanted to die - I wanted to die so much - but the little things were holding me back. I'd had a perfect send-off from nature. Hell, I'd had a decent last day as a whole. But at the final moment, there were still things that were too amiss for me to go forward. I felt ungrateful. I felt ashamed. I felt empty. But I figured that I could still kill myself another day. It could wait. I went to sleep. I still felt nothing.

&#x200B;

So. I failed, not because I took them, but because I was too afraid to take them. I've been afraid of failure all my life. It's always held me back, but maybe that saved me then.

&#x200B;

I accepted a long time ago that this is just the way it is. Just the way things are. It is the sort of life you might overhear in hushed conversations of the aisles in the supermarket - terribly, terribly sad, and then the conversation is moved on and it is forgotten. Back to the bottles of wine and the crisps.

&#x200B;

But I think there is still a part of me that desperately wants to live. I have so much I want to offer. I write poetry. I want someone to read it sometime. I applied to a summer school. If I killed myself last night, I wouldn't know if I got in. I'm going to refresh my email in a minute, to check.

&#x200B;

I'm here writing this - 11:11AM - and I can still feel that big black bird, sitting on top of my skull. I still want to die. I saved the pills. I put them in a little bag. I understand I might've lost any credibility from my last post - after all, I said I wanted to die and then didn't - but I hope someone is still hearing me. I think I'll take another look at the pills tonight. I hope someone is maybe still holding my hand. I need it so badly.

&#x200B;

But I'm still here, at least for a little while. Maybe a few hours. Maybe days. Maybe years. Maybe just until my 17th birthday. I don't know how long I'll have the courage to hold on for. But I'm still holding on.

I didn't think anyone would listen. This is a really long post - hell, I doubt anyone's reading at this point. But I know I was heard. I woke up to so much love this morning. All I can say is thank you."
ju1ia7,SuicideWatch,There is no easy way to die,"People always say that killing yourself is the easy way out when in reality theres nothing easy about it.There is so many different methods all with their own pros and cons and then on top of that, i dont know what happens after we die. I hope that its the same meaningless void that existed before i was born  but i cant ever be sure. And then all people say ""oh just tell your parents"" as if i didnt think of that before."
jh7cg2,SuicideWatch,My brother (17) killed himself in 2017 and I'm (16) thinking of doing the same,"My brother hung himself in 2017 i was the first to found him. I thought it was a joke, when i realized i didn't screamed i was shocked. I casually walk to my mom's room and tell her my brother killed himself in his room. She called the ambulance but it was to late. There's a note it's pretty long and my mother threw it in the trash but i was able to read it. It basically says that he can't fit in anywhere even in his own family, that he doesn't know if he have a purpose in live, and that he was a burden to me and our mom who's a single mother. Today my mom doesn't mention him at all because she doesn't have any time to think about it. The reason why I'm writing this is because i feel that same way that he felt and i think I'm going to commit suicide. Maybe tomorrow or maybe even next year but i think i will do it no matter what happens.


I don't even know the real reason why I'm posting this. I'm writing to a bunch of stranger that i will never meet and will forget about this post in a couple of hours.


Ps. You don't have to waste money on awards for my post I'm just reaching out because idk who to talk to irl."
hdwiw2,SuicideWatch,I don't eat or sleep anymore and I hope it'll kill me.,"As of writing this I have not slept for aprox 60 to 70 hours, have consumed no nutrition or water besides miniscule amounts that my primal instincts demanded of me. But I resist and have not eaten for 40 hours i believe.

And while as the pathetic worthless low value man I am, I can not even commit the simple heroic act of removing my inferior genes from the genepool through efficent means. To blow your brains out, jump in front of a train, burn yourself, I could've chosen so many ways.

&#x200B;

But here I am now hoping to perish. Eventually my body has to determine it has to shut down hopefully completely. I don't feel any pain from it anymore, in fact I feel nothing slowly becoming a husk.

I can still think clearly, in fact that is what I wish I couldn't. I can think so clearly that I'm hoping to die even more.

While I write this feel all the futility of existence wrap around me, hugging me lovingly, more than a lover ever could, not that I've ever known what a lover will ever feel like ever in my life, or a hug in general that is, not even from a mother.

&#x200B;

Not eating have saved a great deal of money, I used it on material goods that makes me forget the agony my body tries to remind me of. Though slowly the dopamine will stop producing in my brain, it has already happened somewhat. My passions of creativity has no meaning anymore, they're all just a symbolism of emposing death on myself in a vague form.

&#x200B;

Leaving a legacy is the kind of thing a lot of people tend to think about when they're decide to throw the match of chess with the reaper on purpose. It has been on mind all my life really, but not just a material or symbolic legacy but an actual physical one, a family to go on.

But that is not to be, I've reached the point where it's not possible, there is no hope now. And as I view even my material goods and symbols obscure into the black holes just like everyone elses I realize how little purpose there is in anything at all. I don't wanna be here anymore.

&#x200B;

And meanwhile as you skim over these useless words and symbols, it could be that I might've finally went to sleep.

&#x200B;

Hopefully to never wake up ever again.

I want to MURDER myself, that's how much I hate myself","People always say they want to die because nobody understands them or cares about them, but for me, I want to die BECAUSE my loved ones care about me, but I can't give them what they need and deserve, because I'm too fucked in the head and can only ever distract myself with Escapism, neglecting all those around me just to survive, and the pain I'm causing them is making me hate myself but I can't stop. I'm trapped"
etk2kd,SuicideWatch,My post here had not a single like or comment. I feel so alone.,"I guess I really am the only one out there dealing with this never ending crap..people always say you're never alone, but they dont know what its like to be me."
c9hfw3,SuicideWatch,Why is it so hard for some people to accept that life just isn't that great for some people?,"Some people just get completely, utterly screwed, traumatized and limited by life, to the point that living just isn't enjoyable anymore. To the point that any wild-eyed optimism one might have had in the face of adversity just gets drowned by the utter disillusionment that no - sometimes even if there was a will, there's wasn't much of any way, and even if there still is, it's not worth finding.

I've seen people say they can't even imagine what it must feel like to want to end your life or to even be depressed. On the flip side, it's hard for me to imagine what it'd be like to not feel depression as that's been most of my life, with tiny windows of joy where it felt like my efforts to outrun my horrible background were paying off. Those windows have closed and even if there are others left to open somewhere, I don't care, because they don't even look like ways out anymore. I'm at the point someone could give me a million dollars and it wouldn't make me happy.

But guess what the worst thing of all is? You have a *survival instinct.* Living another day feels awful, but dying is still terrifying, and beyond that it's drummed into your head that you'll hurt people if you somehow think you might be able to overcome the strongest instinct of all. You don't even want to die, just for your reality to be fundamentally different, but that's obviously not how this all works.

So, you're stuck in this hell that's been aptly described like the mental equivalent to a burning building, and there's no grand purpose to it - there's no big meaning or reward for suffering through it - you just had really bad luck. You just happened to be the organism born to become self-aware within an absolutely shitty situation, to the point many people  objectively admit you were, and now you've got to either take it or leave it and both options feel pretty horrible, but one at least feels like a solution in that this whole situation simply ends.

The thing is, too, I bet if it was somehow possible for a person that feels normal, or god forbid, happy, to experience this feeling for a day, they'd totally understand wanting to leave it and be incredibly grateful they've never spent a day in the desperate void that leads one to truly consider suicide.

So, fuck it."
d16gmi,SuicideWatch,I just called the hotline and got hung up on. Talk about feeling alone,"He answered and said his name. I said hello Kevin, how are you. He asked how I was I said “okay, I’m very sad” and I got the dial tone. Thank you very much, Kevin."

dt7ns0,SuicideWatch,Why does living with depression just feel like a series of necessary distractions?,"Every single damn day I have to find at least one thing to distract me from the fact that I want to die. 

I don't want to hurt.  I don't want to suffer. I don't want to take anyone with me in the process.

I don't want to fail at it and end up with some kind of neurological issue or permament physical injury. 

I don't want to hurt the ones who care about me, either.  Like my parents. I love them. 


But I am just so damn tired of living.  It would be so nice if I could just fall asleep and not wake up.  

How nice it must be to not have depression. To not want to die.  I can't imagine how nice it must be going a day without fighting my own self..."

lh2wux,SuicideWatch,It’s so fucking frustrating that so many people that have zero experience with mental illness think they know what constitutes an “attention seeker” vs “reaching out”,"When I start panicking, I can’t think straight at all, and I start reaching out for support in any way I can. If my therapy wasn’t helpful to me the day prior, no shit I’m going to reach out to people other than him if I’m really upset. All help lines ive tried are also shit, so I’ve resorted to reaching out online and sometimes to people I know in real life. 

Sometimes when I’m panicking I’ll tell someone that I want to kill myself in the hopes that they’ll respond with something that will make me feel better. Usually I’m told that I’m looking for attention, because if I really wanted to kill myself id just do it right? 

Half of the day I feel like screaming out that I want to kill myself so someone will make me feel better and make me not want to kill myself. I know the reaction I’ll get though. I wish people would use their brains and think through what it might be like to be someone with a  severe mental illness, it’s fucking torture. Like yes, we we don’t deserve to be put on a pedestal above you obviously, but maybe we do deserve a little special treatment, to be told that we deserve to live, to be given support, a hug, anything. You owe it to someone if they’re struggling and they reach out to you to not be an asshole and to give them at least an ounce of support"
d7on6t,SuicideWatch,I tried to kill myself.,"Not today, not yesterday, 9 years ago. No one knows. No one noticed. I took a bunch of pills out of various bottles my family had lying around. Adderal, percocet, sleeping pills, and allergy meds were among them. I don’t know what else. There were more than four bottles. It was just whatever I could find. I swallowed some of each, chasing them with a wine cooler. Let a few dissolve on my tongue because I liked the sickening feeling they induced. I thought that would be enough. After a few minutes of nothing happening, I swallowed more. Got dizzy. Struggled to make it to the couch. Passed out. I was passed out in the living room and my family didn’t notice. They walked by me and didn’t notice. I still remember it all vividly and think of it often. I had no regrets. I wanted to die. Waking up, realizing I was still alive, that was the worst feeling I’ve ever felt. It put me in a daze. I’ve felt on pause ever since. I often regret not dying. I feel like I should be dead. I feel like a large part of me did die that day. The only reason I didn’t immediately try again was fear of not fully dying. I knew I couldn’t go through that again and didn’t have other resources I felt were adequate. I dropped out of school shortly after. I stopped leaving my house. I see all these stories of people living and being ecstatic over it. I don’t have that. Life hasn’t gotten better. I just wanted to tell someone."
b0tmq3,SuicideWatch,I almost died yesterday,"I almost did it yesterday. I skipped school and went into the woods with some alcohol and a rope and I planned to end my life. I tied the noose and I jumped from a tree. Miraculously my neck didn’t break and and a homeless man came out of nowhere and cut me down. In that second that I was hanging from the tree all I could think about was how much of a mistake it was. I spent the rest of that day talking with the homeless man and learning about his experiences and I realized that life has its ups and downs but that’s what life is, you gotta live through the pain because it’s all experiences, not good or bad experiences, just experiences.

eajxf4,SuicideWatch,killing myself on jan 1st 2020,"my parents found out i have depression, now my mom is treating me differently while my dad takes on a more gentler and understanding approach. My mom is guilt tripping me and telling me to kill myself, she wouldn't care she said. So I was deeply hurt, I recently purchased a rope 2 hours ago online. I'm planning to write goodbye letters next to my ex-boyfriend who I always loved, my friend who I drifted apart with but our memories together haunts me, my best friends who stuck around me and helped me get better, which vainly failed. And of course, my dad, I love my dad very much. I already wrote a will 2 months ago. I told my classmates about my plan, and they all tried their best to make me feel better. I love them so much, but if I have to endure the pain everyday at home being discriminated and bullied by my mom... I just can't...

ipg2s9,SuicideWatch,I want to pass away so badly,"I don't want to kill myself I just want to pass away so people won't feel guilty

Life hurts so badly and it just doesn't have any meaning anymore. I keep holding onto the good things and it keeps hurting me. I'm literally useless, I have no purpose. I make everything worse and I'm so done with people having to put up with me. I know what people in my life truly feel about me and I can't blame them. I want to make it easier for everyone and just die. I want to make it easier for myself. But I'm so cowardly I can't bring myself to kill myself. And there's this voice that keeps telling me what I'll miss out on. But I don't want to keep living painfully and regretting every second of my life, and making it hard for everyone else. I'm scared to die and yet I want it so bad. I hope I can just pass away in my sleep tonight or some day soon."

I'm managing, I hope you are too. Please stay safe."
hbd6th,SuicideWatch,"If I could exchange my life with someone who needs it more, I would.","I’m failing, I’m a huge disappointment. For all these years, I acted like I don’t give a shit about everything, my parents are extremely carefree, living almost like teenagers the day they got an annulment when I was 4. I didn’t grew up with any of them for my whole grade school and they’ve staggered back into my life when I reach mid-high school, I hate them. They made me feel like a burden, like an excess baggage, like I was holding them back to go on with whatever the fuck they wanted to do. I’m sorry if you made a souvenir from you fucked up marriage, trust me I didn’t want to be born either. I’m sorry if you always see your ex-spouse in my face and all of my mistakes, I’m sorry that I looked like a splitting image between the two of you. I’m sorry if I’m not the daughter you hoped for, I’m not academically smart, I failed my year, I couldn’t tell you. I don’t want to hear your judgement anymore, I already know how much of a waste I am. 

I’ve made my decision since April, I gave myself a small deadline but it kept on extending because luckily schools still have a hard time reopening and I feel pretty shitty leaving the two most important people in my life, my best friends.I don’t want to die, I just don’t want to exist anymore, so they don’t have to grieve and feel like they could’ve done something to save me but I really am just so tired. I can’t tell anyone how I’m feeling, whenever I opened up I’ll get set aside, told to be strong or they say that they’re for me when they’re really not. I dunno why I decided to spill my emotional baggage to a bunch of strangers in the internet but it sucks when I’m more comfortable opening up here than with my friends. 

It didn’t help either that I’m stuck 24/7 inside the house like most people are during quarantine but there had been riots outside and the government being a huge douchebag to it’s citizens. I know I’m being selfish when there are more important matters in the world right now; racism and discrimination, world hunger, poverty, abuse, people who have incurable diseases. I wonder why the world is such a harsh place, I know that life isn’t fair but what the hell?  If I could exchange my life with someone who needs it more, I would. 

I want people to know that I tried. I tried to ask for help, with my family, friends and even try seeking a counselor secretly because apparently, having a mental health problem is considered crazy, an attention seeker or being overly dramatic. My family told me to suck it up, I’ll survive, life isn’t fair. My friends told me they’re there for me but my trust issues says no, suffer on your own, you don’t want to burden them or overshare your sob story, my pride tells me to keep them in the dark with my troubles too because I’ve been perceived as a fighter in our group, I’m always the one who’d they run to when they have a problem, in need of an advice or if there’s a fight amongst us I’m always in the neutral. I don’t want them to see me so vulnerable like this. I reached out to my adviser and then a guidance counselor, I’ve immediately been told that everything between us with be kept confidential UNLESS they see certain signs and they’d immediately tell it to the proper authorities. Yeah, I ghosted him after that message. 

I wonder if those painkillers would really take effect if I swallowed it all. Would it really kill my pain?  

June 25th is my deadline, it sucks coz I’m actually looking a bit forward to my 18th birthday in July 5th but I have to do it. I can’t take anymore humiliation, suffering and disappointment. I’m still a failure.

I don’t have any other way to contact them or their family. I feel like a piece of shit for not checking up on them or doing anything. I’m praying that this didn’t happen. Oh God

Edit 1: still no reply from them. It’s been ~10 hours since I’ve first reached out to them. I was able to find what I assume their address. Attempted to call their local PD for a welfare check but they are closed on the weekends. No social media of theirs was found. I found their old cell phone number which is either off or disconnected (most likely). I found what I assume their wife’s or daughter’s cell phone which goes directly to voicemail as well.

Please don’t spend your money to give me awards.

Edit 2: Wanted to give you guys a quick update and thank all of you for the well wishes, advice, and just plain support you have provided me in these times. 

This morning I got an email from the company he works for. They told me that he is away due to a medical emergency. This means he is ALIVE.

I have too many responsibilities for that ever to be an option, though, even if I have doubts that I’ll ever be “happy.”

But I can’t say this to anyone because they’ll freak out. They’ll think they should call a hospital, or tell someone in my family, or at the very least treat me differently or not let me tell dark jokes.

cl69bb,SuicideWatch,I don’t want to get “help”,No I don’t want to get better. In fact I want to get worse. I want to get so bad that I have no choice but to kill myself. Why would I want to get better if I want to die? Getting “better” will only slightly decrease my depression to the point where I still feel like shit but not enough to want to die and I’m sorry but that’s the opposite of what I want. I don’t want to dish out a ridiculous amount of money for someone to convince me that I should keep living this ridiculously expensive and worthless life for another few decades. Death is the only way to free myself from all the problems in my life. Medication and therapy might minimize it but it’ll never truly go away. The longer I’m alive the more problems will pop up and ending it right now is the only reasonable thing for me to do.
c5j2vf,SuicideWatch,My daughter (14f) tried to kill herself last night,"To put it simply, I am so lost. This is the second time she has done something suicidal and I have tried my hardest to be there for her every step of the way. There are so many factors that go into this that I could type (on mobile) until my thumbs hurt. I am hurt. I don’t know how to trust her. It sucks so bad I just want to be there for her and twice now I have been informed by second parties that this has happened. I found her in the garage last night after taking a handful of pills. She was scared said she thought she was a freak. I told her I loved her no matter what. I consoled sisters and called grandmas so I could meet her and her mom at the hospital.  I told her I loved her, and now everything today is like normal. I am hurt. I am so hurt and I don’t want to put that on her. But I am tiered of emotional pep talks, and it hurt to know everything I’ve ever said to her didn’t help. I’m sorry for this thread.
I’m honestly overall just sorry."
gttkdi,SuicideWatch,I died yesterday,I died yesterday and now for some reason my body is moving but I’m dead inside. Yesterday was it. I’m dead. I have nothing on the inside. No joy. No sorrow. No up. No down. No conversation. Nothing. I am a body that’s waiting for death whenever that may be because I’m already dead.
gv2cet,SuicideWatch,I'm afraid one day I'll just snap and kill myself,"To be honest every time I'm angry or sad my mind goes to suicide. Even the smallest things: an argument, missing the bus, anything. And I'm just scared one day I'll get so mad or sad I'll kill myself. It's been like this for a year or two, but it keeps getting worse. I'm just so scared. I feel bad because other people have it worse then I do, but I'm just whining and afraid. A friend told me ""other people's worse problems don't mean you're problems aren't bad"" but I'm just so scared"
c1qw03,SuicideWatch,Does anyone else think about suicide every few seconds?,"It's constantly on my mind. It doesn't matter what I'm doing. If I'm at work, or home or outside. The thoughts are always there. I'm talking about literally every 10-20 seconds I think about killing myself."
hcyr32,SuicideWatch,So let me get this straight...I have to do this for another 50+ years?,"So let me get this straight: I never asked to be born, but I was. 

I was born in a shit city and grew up in shit neighborhoods. Still here, still causing mental issues.

I was born with serious mental issues that caused me to harm people when I was younger.  

Never felt human at all or at least not for too long. Could never ground myself and always fantasized about leaving for another world. 

Ah, also unintelligent, going through school with poor grades, school fucked me up and causes my dreams to be themed around it nearly *every night.* Yet, people think I can make it through college. 

For some reason almost always irritable around family and tired of being constantly asked to do things, just want to be left alone. 

People have this romanticized view of me and contradict the truth that I'm evil and mean-hearted and deserve death. No matter how determined I am and how much I build myself up, I can't escape it. 

Pathetic, unless, unreliable, and a child in their mid-twenties. 

Pandemic has taught me how crazy it can drive you to be the house with people all the time. But I realize this just proves even more how mean I am. 

Considering who and what I am, my family would be lying if they say they wouldn't be better off. Who wouldn't reasonably trade not having to deal with that anymore? Or even for something better. 

Humanity can't seem to accept that some people really are not meant for this and a self-inflicted death would be a positive. But they'd rather shame, guilt, belittle, patronize, and spite you into living...because that is the reasonable way to do it..."
ja64if,SuicideWatch,My dad fired the gun,"It’s hard to see the person you look up to the most hurting so bad. 

My dad put a pistol to his head and pull the trigger. The gun fired but I guess he missed? I don’t know. I wasn’t there. 

But now what? We are all sitting up, scared, pissed, hurt, grateful he’s alive, and he is in bed asleep. 

I paced the house for an hour and finally decided to smoke a joint out back. That’s where I am now. Alone. Bare foot and high. 

I keep imagining these made up scenarios where he goes through with it and I can hear my moms screams   I can see his body slumped over on the bed with a blank expression on his face. My stomach starts to hurt and I have to distract myself. 

He’s 73 years old. Father of 5. Grandad to 14 grandchildren and 5 great grandchildren. Him and mom have been through it all. Divorced and both remarried then found each other again. Together ever since. 

I know that I will never know what made him want to attempt to take his own life. But I can’t help the feel the need to know. 

I’m spending the night in my parents living room 10 feet from their bedroom door. There won’t be much sleep and I’ve already taken off work tomorrow. 

I’ve been fighting my breakdown for a few hours now. I know it’s coming and I know it’s going to be pretty hard. 

This is going to be hard."
g7ijp1,SuicideWatch,the amount of people suffering here is insane,"do you sometimes realize that the amount of people suffering from severe depression and on the brink of killing themselves on this subreddit and outside of this subreddit really speaks the painful truth about our socaity and our world in general? the world we live in ladies and gentlemen are crule uncaring and cold
in this socaity we view the mentaly ill as an outcast an alien a very disgusting and unacceptable creature....which we pretend to care about and try to ""help"" them
if you suffer from cancer or any other illness people can actually acknowledge your pain and know you are suffering
they know how hug your scars are
but with mental illness people sometimes understemate your suffering
people understemate how severe your depression actually is
people say go get therapy, take anti depressiants but its not a 100% cure it never cured everyone((i myself took pills but it never worked))
actually depression and other disorders
never had a magical cure like we have on flu...yet we dont take it seriously 
and the result? suicide

i really wish depression was like a flu it could get away with some medicine
but no ...its like a curse...once you get it
its gonna never stop hurting you
only if its not too late and only if you got some huge will to live you maybe can get through it ...maybe
its like a snake ...eats you from the inside out
first it eats your will to live and then it eats your ability to enjoy things 
and finally when it really completely took over your mind and body ...it will make you wish for death and later on plan it
this snake feeds on neglect truamatizing events
and deep scars left unhealed...and we can only destroy this cursed snake with care , love and good treatment
not risk truamatize suicidal people with more shit...i swear people could never understand us and only the ones who suffer like us can only understand what if really feels like to have this shitty disorder...
if only people could at least show a bit of understand and care
we would'nt ever get to this point
that idea really makes me hate humanity and myself even more...everything bad happens to us is what we deserve 
we all cold and greedy
we all just take take and take
we never give
we never gave to eachother nor to this poor plant
we all deserve to die 
no one is good
if there is good left in us its only minor
god if you even exist please end us already
please end me...i dont want to see myself living inside this hell forever
the hell is in me and in the world
i can never fix myself nor i can fix the fucked up world
the best i could do is just die

edit : one day and this many upvotes? well i gusse there are a lot of people who get me , wow im not completely misunderstood for being a sick fuck!
thanks for you all ....you all are my shining hope in this darkness ...im lost here and trying to find my way out of here...
well at least the moment i die i could still think back and see i was never alone in how i saw this world"
lwbgf8,SuicideWatch,I see no future for myself.,"Idk where else to vent because no one cares. I’m 16 and I have barely set myself up to face the real world. All I do is play video games. I feel so dumb at school because I’m only taking one AP class and I’m failing it. I can’t drive, and I have never had a job. I don’t have any useful skills for college and I don’t want to be like my brothers who dropped out and stayed home for the rest of their adulthood. I’m already a failure at even the most basic thing: Eating. I’m anorexic and I wish it would just kill me already. I’m such a failure I can’t do anything right in the real world."

g7szm1,SuicideWatch,I don’t want to live without him,It’s been 8 years since my fiancé was murdered in a robbery gone bad and I wish I could say I’m better but I’m not. I’ve hated my life every moment of every day since he left. I hate this world for taking him from me over something so stupid. I was born to a family that doesn’t love me and everyone has treated me like shit except him and now I have to live the rest of my miserable life without him. I’ve prayed for the courage to end it all. I’ve tried every single antidepressant available and it only makes things worse. The worst is discussing it with others because they always try to force me to date someone else and move on but I don’t want anyone else. The thought of being with someone else makes me feel sick. I’m not over my fiancé and I never will be. I think I was pregnant by him around the time he died but miscarried due to stress. I don’t want to live with this pain anymore. I’m never going to love someone like that or be loved like that again. I will never marry or have a family. I will never watch my kids graduate high school or meet my grandchildren. My life is a waste and means nothing. I wish someone would shoot me in the head too 😭

fvvuxo,SuicideWatch,Please read this if you have the time.,"I'm really hoping somebody sees this, even if that seems selfish.

Maybe this isn't the right place for this. I'm new to this whole Reddit thing, so I was pretty shocked when I found this subreddit. the world is pretty crazy these days, I guess. I have no clue how many people will see this, or if anyone will see it, but I just need a place to vent. So, here's a not-so-short summary of my entire life story.

I was born at a very young age in Korea to a woman and a man (who already had another child, my sister) in a crippling amount of debt. I moved to Canada after a couple of years of living in Korea, my father's irresponsible investments and petty crime following us from across the globe.

I was four when my mother hit me for the first time. I don't remember the particular instance, but it was then for sure. To me, it seemed as if my mother would go out of her way to hit me whenever the opportunity arose. ANY opportunity at all. She would beat me senseless for not cleaning my room or eating too slow, or whatever other trivial matter she felt like punishing me for. There have been far too many instances in my life so far, where I, an innocent child, has cowered at the hands of her mother, thinking it was the end. She has made me fear for my life on numerous accounts.

I was in the third grade when I called my mom a bitch for the first and last time. I just remember being so insanely frustrated with the way she treated me, and the way she was so much more accepting and lax when it came to disciplining my older sister. I muttered it with seething anger on my way out the door that day. She called the school I was attending at the time and told them I was ""sick"". She kept me home and beat me with a metal music stand, aiming for my head, my throat, and just about anywhere else she figured she could land a blow. This went on until my barely present father came home from work. I was sent to school the next day, being given a kiss before I left as if the day before had never happened.

My school performance was never awful. in fact, it was more the opposite. I was considered somewhat of a child prodigy. School was the one place I felt I could truly thrive, if ever. I did have what I would consider seriously awful behaviour in school, as I would lash out at other children with the same violent tendencies as my mother. This was not brought to anybody's attention, so for a very long time, which means it was not corrected until much later in my life.

The (abusive?) cycle kept going the way it was, with her beating the shit out of me for the sake of discipline, and then acting if she was some sort of saint the very next day, with not even a hint of guilt or remorse on her face. I remember being in the fourth grade, sick of being ""disciplined"". I picked up our landline and looked her in the eye,

""I'm going to call the police and tell them everything you do to me."" And she said,""Go ahead, nobody is going to help you."" I felt completely defeated. There was no help for me. There was no escape. Even at the tender age of 9, I started to feel as if there was no escape but death. I felt as if I couldn't talk to anyone about this. 'Mom would probably hit me again.' 'Dad is never home.' ' I know she wouldn't get it.' I knew that if I talked about it at school, that legal troubles were sure to ensue, so I kept my mouth shut for a long time.

Another memorable instance happened in the fifth grade, when my mother fell insanely ill out of nowhere. we were at the pool. She seemed to be completely fine just moments before, but now she was seemingly dying in a changing stall, telling me to get her help over and over again. And I didn't. Call me a heathen. I stood right in front of the stall door and prayed with all my heart and soul that she would just die and leave me alone. She didn't. Some days I still wish that she did.

Fast forward just a little more. There I was, a tender 11, resentful and bitter at the world. I didn't give a shit about anything. I just wanted it to be over. My school performance started to slip, I just couldn't understand like I could before. Anything and Everything was insanely distracting, and I took to watching anime and gameplay videos as a means of escape from the world. Somehow, my hungover teacher would still find any excuse to give me a good mark, and I was still considered a prodigy, despite my near fail scores. I couldn't do math to save my life, but because of the way I was treated, I would chant to myself 'at least I'm smart' to make me feel better about it all. I was accepted into an academic challenge program for junior high, which only further inflated my ego.

When I got to my brand new school, I realized a couple of things: 1. Years of being violent towards my peers left me completely unapproachable. 2. I had extreme trust issues. 3. I was fucking stupid compared to my peers. I so badly wanted junior high to be my break, my way out. I wanted so badly for everything to get better. But I couldn't make any new friends (probably because I was terrifying, we're talking descriptive death threats left and right) and my academics were not improving at all. Focusing was near impossible. I couldn't ever shut my mouth. Everyone hated me. I was at an all time low, and I still didn't have a single soul to tell this to. I couldn't trust those kids at school, they'd hand me over to the police like I was nothing. I never wanted that. I desperately wanted to put my past behind me. My mom had stopped beating me (only after figuring that her multiple illnesses made her weaker than I was) but it still felt as if she would strike again at any moment. I was living on edge at home and school. I managed to raise myself a little, teaching myself to trust little by little. Teaching myself what was morally acceptable. Anything to make me even one friend.

Eighth grade was somewhat of a breeze. I had friends, and people seemed to no longer think I was terrifying. But of course, in a cruel world such as this, nothing can ever be completely good. my grades were slipping hard. I procrastinated to the end of my life, and every assignment I handed in was complete shit. Things didn't really improve family wise either. My mom would be pissed at me if I was sick and bedridden, since that's an inconvenience to her. My dad was drunk every single day and my sister was starting to become a second mother. Definitely not ideal, but I would fight my way through it. look at what I had already overcome!

Ninth grade. shit. I realized that people didn't actually like me. To everyone, I was just a background character, nothing more than a forgettable nobody. I felt invisible, like I was talking and people just didn't even care that I was there. This is also the year I was diagnosed with ADHD. Family didn't take it well, or rather they just didn't take it. None of them have really bothered to look into ADHD at all, nobody asked the doctor any questions, none. Zip. Nada. My parents don't give a damn. They've made no means to learn about it. They just pump me full of what's essentially meth as medication and hope I shut the fuck up. They don't reprimand my older sister calling me retarded at any given chance. Nothing. It's awful knowing that because of this, I'll never be normal. Nevertheless, I kept working towards self improvement. I was making good progress. I really thought I had a shot at getting better and fully escaping my past-

nope. quarantine. I'm stuck at home with my family. My mom has definitely calmed down, but I know that deep down she resents me. Now, my sister is my biggest enemy. She truly is my second mother. She belittles me constantly, insulting me and disregarding me. Worst of all, she pretends she's a fucking saint, just like my mother. When I confront her about the things she does, all I get is a

""No I don't, I don't have any idea what you're talking about!"" And then she just keeps on hanging around in my room pretending like we're best friends, as if she didn't call me a defective retard the other day.

And here I am now, washed up at 14, unable to recover from my past. Broken forever. Defective. Stupid. Unmotivated. Invisible to the world. I want to end it all. I have nothing to lose. I am nothing. I purposefully omitted my current age until the end of the post because I didn't want people to think I was a ""sad girl"" or just a typical teenager. The more I read this though, the more I'm starting to think I am just stupid teenager who needs to be disregarded. My feelings are invalid. I hate myself.

If anyone is really out here, and I'm not completely invisible, please say something. I don't want to be alone anymore. I don't think I can do this anymore. I don't want to be alone anymore. Please."
9rq2jd,SuicideWatch,"I killed my girlfriend, and now I want to kill myself.."," 

Before you read my true story, I want you to know that I'm not very good at English, as it's my second language so bare with me if I have made grammatical mistakes or anything, and honestly I really haven't opened up about this incident in my life, until today.

Anyway,

This one random late night in March 2017, I decided to download the Tinder app (probably the worst decisions in my life) , but I'm genuinely a introvert person, so it's hard for me to make conversation on spot to get to know people. Most people hop on tinder to troll, some to get laid but I was on it to find ""true love"". Fast forward to two months of most girls wanting to just party or I was to boring to form a conversation, this one random day I got super liked by this girl named Laura. We both started to talk, we both had a lot of similarities between us and she was literally 2 miles away from my place. It had been 2 weeks, we both still haven't meet but our conversations started to get more personal, and I felt a real connection between us two. We both replied long, it used to take me a good 45mins to an hour to reply, it was just how it was. It was however odd for me that she was really beautiful, and I was a ugly mf. She came from a small town family, where as me, I was a city kid, from a wealthy family (although she didn't know that for along time).

After the 2 weeks of talking, we both decided to meet up for lunch. Like when I say she was simple, she had no idea about brands or anything. I dressed up with some yeezy 750s, she didn't even know them. And some part of me liked that she was like that, because most of the times, I only wore to show off, to feel rich, to feel accepted. One thing about being rich is that, the definition of happiness is so different to what a average person would say. Like an average person has aspirations of having a nice house, a nice car, nice gadgets and all but it's different being born wealthy, like I had everything that anyone would aspire of having, it's different when you have everything. Anyway that just made me like Laura more because she was a simple person, a bit mysterious and I was always curious to know more about her.

We ended up dating for 6 months, and I knew she was the one for me, she was beautiful, she loved me for who I was, I didn't have to pretend to be this cool dude like I did with my friends, she loved the sensitive little bitch I was. Everything was going well, till (Jan 2018) she called and cried, her father was diagnosed with lung cancer at a bad stage, the doctors said they could cure it but he would only survive for a couple of months. Laura was going through some tough times, but I was always with her, trying to make her strong. She would tell me stories about her dad, like how they used to horse ride back when they used to live on farm lands, and how he would work 14 hours everyday just his both daughters could have the life that every other kid had. Tbh that got me so depressed, like the fact that her father sacrificed so much for his kids and all. But no matter what had happened over the next few months, years or the next decade or so, i said to myself that I would always be with Laura, and I wanted to marry her.

We got back to our casual routines, she was getting better and better, and on her birthday 11th of March, I proposed to her, I honestly didn't know if it was the right time or not, but I felt like I needed to tell her that I'm gonna be committed and not just saying it but i wanted to show her. Laura said yes, cried and hugged so hard that I thought she would break my bones, but I knew that this meant a lot to her.

April 11th 2018.

This part is going to be hard for me, as I am typing my fingers are twitching, I'm really scared, because to say it out is something i haven't done... Anyway, on this very day, I picked up Laura, we were driving to the hospital to visit her dad, we went on the highway. Till this high speeding car (prolly doing 150kmph) tried to overtake a vechile in front of us so we were behind this car, but suddenly suddenly the person slammed the brakes and dropped back, causing me to smash into the car. After this moment, I don't remember a thing. It felt like I died, I could hear my surroundings but I couldn't see anything, Idk how long or anything I woke up and the first thing I asked was ""what happened to laura?"" and my mum started to cry but i thought she was crying for me. I kept asking, and no one replied. Then it hit me, it hit me that she's not alive, and i couldn't understand. It all happened in a flash of a second.. The love of my life was gone, and I could do nothing about it, i didn't know how to take it in, it fucked me up. I only had minor injuries, but I was mentally dead.

Fast forward to a month, I still was in shock, infact I still am.. I went to visit her family, to apologies, but couldn't even let out a word, just cried out loud, but somehow they understood my pain. Laura's dad seemed to be weaker, her mum always had a smile on but she looked so bad, she was in shock and it just made me feel worse and worse. A week later, I found out that Laura's dad had passed away, i wasn't ready for the funeral, I didn't go to laura's too because I couldn't accept it but my mum told me that I had to go to comfort her mum. But laura's mum had completely changed, she didn't want to hear anything from anyone because two of the most people in her life had passed away and I honestly could do nothing but cry looking at her.

Fast forward it to now, there hasn't been a day I felt that I could have done better, I could have reacted better, and if i had turned the other way, maybe I could have died instead of laura, maybe she survived she could have been with her dad for the rest of time, maybe seeing her daughter would have kept him alive for a bit longer, maybe the mum would have been brave having her daughter around. I know it's not my fault, i've heard people say that constantly, it's not fault bro"" but I could have done better, to prevent it, and that is stuck in my mind, and always will. I honestly have no hope for life, I just want to die, i can't get over these thoughts, I just hope I die real soon.... It's not that I want sympathy but I just can't deal with it, it hurts."

Since then I just can’t. It’s not because I don’t want to. It’s not because I‘m incapable of doing it. I know I’m intelligent, and I know I am capable of doing all the work that’s being given to me. But I literally just can’t. I cant bring myself to do it. It’s the worst feeling ever. I feel like all my teachers are silently judging me for “not caring” or being “one of those students” and it hurts so bad. It’s so much deeper than that. I care so much but so little at the same time. I feel guilty because all I do is lie in bed all day and scroll through social media until it gets dark and then I go to bed. I’ve been stuck in that routine for so long. It’s not that I don’t want to get out of it, it’s that I can’t. This is what I’m accustomed to. This is what’s normal to me. I hate it so much but I just don’t know what to do. Okay thanks for reading if you did I just wanted to rant and hopefully get some reassurance that I’m not alone."

* Yes I care about my hygiene and looks because I learned it that way and it's hard to dislearn something like eating with a fork and knife
* Yes I hit the gym every other day 

But why the fuck does that have something to do with my mental health?

I'm a male and it's already hard af to hide your feelings in public because of social pressure (at least in Germany) but shit like that is driving me mad if people think that being attractive makes you imune against depression and so on.

The fucked up part is that I'm just sitting frustrated about why it didn't go off. I saw my therapist last Saturday and told him about it. He asked if I was willing to bring the gun to him for safe keeping. I complied. Later that day I checked myself into an urgent psychiatric center and they almost kept me. They prescribed Zyprexa instead and after telling my story, the psychologist started crying. That didn't help. The Zyprexa has made me feel numb. I'm not sad, and I'm not happy. I don't want to be alive anymore, or rather, I simply wished I didn't exist. Just needed to get that out. To anyone that reads this, thank you."

It's left me absolutely shook. Even writing this I'm shaking and my breathing is unnatural. I'm so scared, I'm really fucking scared. This is my first attempt so I've never felt anything like this before, the tears, the shaking, all of it. I can't stop crying, I can't believe this is real. Who knows if I'm gonna even be here next week, the way things are going I'm unsure, and this frightens the hell out of me.

I've had a therapist for the last 6 or so months and it really helped, but as soon as I stopped I instantly when back into my depressive state. I don't want to be stuck talking to a therapist my entire life. So I haven't been back and I don't plan too. 

If you've read this far, thank you so much for hearing me out, I just had to say this, I feel sick after what's happened.

lklx20,SuicideWatch,All I needed was a job. Now I’ve given up.,"I’m an unemployed Engineer. I spent 18 years of my life in schooling just to get here and be ghosted by every job I’ve applied to in the past 2 years. Fuck it. I grew up thinking that work was the hard part you had to do to live your life. I never knew the true hard part was finding work. I thought work was a necessity forced upon you. Not something that isn’t even accessible in the first place.

Fuck this. If society doesn’t need me then I have no purpose. And purpose is all I’ve ever wanted"
etsvym,SuicideWatch,"No one will see this but if you do, thank you 🖤","I’m at home with my mum (who is asleep), usually my Stepdad is home too but I told him that my uncle is coming round, with even some false proof, he believed me so he has gone to his hour or two work shift. 

I did it so I could cry on my own, contemplating kms, because for years, since I was about 8 I have been thinking about it, getting stronger over time. I am always paranoid, looking around every corner, everyday contemplating. I just want it to end, so much has happened, people think I have it all, but it is all just a lie. About once a week I look up to see what the quickest way to kms is, to see if someone came up with a new and easy way. 

People say that I’m not alone, they all do, but these days I believe I really am, they say don’t do it. I have ambitions in life, but I know that I will never complete them, I will be gone soon and I know it, never having done any good except a few occasions when I made my family happy. I know what could have been, but now, right now, I’m a waste of a life and there is no reason to go on.  I suffer so much, I have no hope but I know things that I want to do in life, things that I want to see, places that I want to go to, people that I want to meet, but I am literally on the edge. They say call these numbers, go to these groups. They to me are worth nothing. I really wanted to live, but I can’t suffer like this anymore.

Sincerely, Kris"
ju7ebo,SuicideWatch,'if you kill yourself your passing your pain to someone else' pretty sure i wouldn't care if i im already dead.,"Im sick and tired of going through the same fucking thing over and over again I'm at my limit where one person telling me not to kill myself just makes me wanna do it twice as bad.

You wanna stop me from doing it? Give me reasons to live don't give me reason's to not die we're all gonna die one day so what's the point? 

At this point even though im only 16F not even in my adult years life really doesn't appeal to me anymore. I get people telling me not to take medication and some even yelling at me to stop it.

I mean..Even the people who tell me life's worth way more then i think it is they can't explain why I've been hurt so many times over the years. 

I even had people believe im just faking this because im one of those ""attention whores"" people usually like me when im not venting.

I even had someone tell me they see potential in me even though i can't even see it in me and they can't even explain it. 

Oh well..Basically today i learned I'll probably not make it to my mid 20s because im getting weaker by the day."

lgv3lx,SuicideWatch,I'm transgender and my family will never accept me.,"I've lived with my parents my whole life, I love them more than anything, but they are very transphobic. I hear them complaining about trans people all the time, and I'm too scared to tell them that they're wrong. I'm not going to come out of the closet, if I do I'm afraid they might disown me. But at the same time, staying in the closet feels like a massive weight on my chest, like I'm lying to everyone in my life. 

I want so badly to have them accept me, but they're so closed minded. I'm considering suicide and just coming out the note. I'm just so scared of everything right now."
jxond0,SuicideWatch,I'm lost,"In my life, I've attempted suicide about 5 times and I've never regretted any attempt once. I remember one time, I woke up in the hospital and the first words I heard were (translated in English) ""Wake up so mother only has to pay -amount-

The thought of suicide crosses my mind every once in a while. I realized my trigger is being unheard (I'm not sure how to translate the word in English).

I dropped out of college after being diagnosed with depression because I couldn't focus, I can't keep a job more than 6 months, and during this pandemic it's getting harder to find a job.

I feel so useless to my family and I don't even think they're trying to understand me. I feel so unheard. No one listens and no one cares. I feel like a tool - unappreciated even after all my help.

Everyday is a struggle and every night I fight the temptation to end it all.

I'm lost in this world and hope it all ends."

*edit: hey, i noticed the comments have been getting spicy and i would like to put my thoughts here instead of repeating them in the comments-

please DONT comment something along the lines of ""i care about you"" or ""i love you"". we are strangers on the internet. you dont know me, i dont know you, we dont know them. that means nothing to the receiving end.

please DO share your own experiences and how they may compare or contrast! i and others would much rather like to hear that we are not alone. theres also no harm in wishing others well rather than telling them things WILL get well.


also, please dont be toxic to each other. i can handle toxic comments, but idk other people's headspaces right now and id rather this post be a chill space than a nasty one. 

thank you.*"

liuy9r,SuicideWatch,I'm so embarrassed that I genuinely am considering suicide.,"First of all: I know I am overreacting, that's what I'm excepting to hear in the replies. So, don't worry, I know. I just want to make it clear that I am diagnosed with Severe Anxiety and I cannot handle embarrassment at all. I normally wouldn't go as far as to say I want to kill myself, but this is a different occasion. 

\[Little NSFW Warning\]

&#x200B;

Last night, I had decided to try masturbation for the first time, normally, I am absolutely revolted by even the thought of it, I am convinced I am Asexual, but I don't want to be. I want to be a normal teenage girl. So, I desperately tried it in hopes it would unlock my ability to feel sexual desire and attraction. I didn't get too far in, being very, VERY hesitant, when my Mom barged in my room to check if I was asleep. I hear her yell ""WHAT WERE \*YOU\* DOING?"", her loud reaction caused my little sister to rush in and also see me, and I'll save the other details.

&#x200B;

We talked after that, and I told her my story of how I was only trying it because I was scared I couldn't feel any sexual feelings, I wish I had've come out as Ace to her right there and then, but I was worried she'd think it was fake. She was so very kind about it, telling me what I tried was normal and that I shouldn't be ashamed that I don't want to do anything like that, and that it was okay. 

&#x200B;

But ever since then, I've been so depressed. It embarrassed me so much, my little sister won't look me in the eyes anymore, and I've felt like utter shit around my mother. I feel so sick that that's forever going to be in her memories, and that she will probably never see me as the innocent girl I expressed I was. The embarrassment and knowing that I cannot change the past weighs me down so much that I just want to fucking kill myself so I don't have to deal with it anymore. I can't sit on my bed without remembering it. This has genuinely made me want to kill myself, and again, I know I'm overreacting. I've tried telling myself that in a few months, maybe even just ***a*** month that this won't matter, but it doesn't work. I feel sick. I don't want to leave my room anymore, I don't want to eat, I don't want to take showers anymore, I don't want to care for myself anymore, because I'm afraid she'll think I'm doing it again (even though I expressed to her that the thought of it was repulsing.)

&#x200B;

I'm sorry, I know no one cares about my weird story, I just wanted to get it off my chest and also ask if anyone knows any tactics to forget memories quicker. Could I just pretend it was a dream? I don't want to feel like this anymore."
jrmi3o,SuicideWatch,Just to thank a girl angel that appears in my dreams,"I'm average teen boy and i've very much depressed lately. I never had a relationship of any kind and I'm loner and socially awkward. I dont like being with anyone I'm like just a sad person who can't handle life well. Even I kinda hate my family as they literally can't understand me and always I'm called demon or monster or someone who cant fit in like im from another country. So I cry, I cry alot but there is one girl who has appeared in my dreams more than 5 times. The last one was like 3 days ago. Let me describe her she is a girl about my age nearly 17 she always appears in yellow sweater with texture like in picture and she wears jeans mostly blue. My dream is like she is just standing in empty space like i cant see far away and I'm always on my knees and all I do is hug her by stomach with my face on her stomach and cry and she just like an angel caresses my head holds me tighter while i cry and just tells me everything will be alright. So to the angel in my dreams THANK YOU, you are the only one who understands me and hold me man I cant tell you how much you mean to me. Thanks for saving me over and over again. I just want to meet you and show you my strong side. I cant thank you enough.

attractive people dont even have to try to be charismatic or socially acceptable, they can say the most retarded shit ever or have the worst personality possible and people will still want to fuck them, as if theyre being hypnotised by their perfect facial ratios and good skin. just fuck this shit. im planning to dump all my money into plastic surgery and if im still not attractive im done. that is all"

f2o37x,SuicideWatch,I want to kill myself. I want to die. NSFW,"**trigger warning - talk of sexual and physical abuse.There is no TL DR, I need to vent. I've never told anyone the entirety of my life. I never wrote down how I felt. I want to see if it helps.**

&#x200B;

I was physically abused by my father. I remember one time he slammed/pushed the kitchen table into my chest while I was eating dinner. It pressed my chair up against the wall, then pushed all the air out of my chest. I remember getting tunnel vision and hitting the floor limp, as the table was pulled away.

When I tried to get up, while on hands and knees, I was kicked in my stomach by him. I don't remember anything other than being on the couch and my mom leaving him after that with me and my 2 brothers. I was 8. This is ONE story.

&#x200B;

My great grandfather used to call me worthless and emotionally abuse me because of my ethnicity. Until I was in my 20's I was reminded daily about how worthless I was over something I had no control over. He basically stepped in as the father figure. I would spend my summers in Southern California helping him super his apartments until I was about 17.

&#x200B;

I have never told anyone this, I was also sexual abused.

&#x200B;

I have never told anyone this, I was raped.

&#x200B;

To me, those are two separate things. When the abuse started, I physically enjoyed it. Had no idea. Then I was brutally sodomized. Then I grew up just a little and that's when I started to hate distrust and not like anyone. I built a fake smile. I built an auto pilot response for everyday things. I don't think. When I can, I do what I can to stop.

&#x200B;

From the ages of 9, to about 14 I was fucking raped weekly by a boy 7 years older(We'll call the fat ugly rapist FMC). I felt like shit because at the start I liked it. I didn't know what was happening to me, I just felt. By the time I was 12, I started to feel disgusted. By 14, I fucking hated everyone. I don't care to discuss the last time he abused me but I will say I don't think he EVER put himself in the position he was in. He left me alone at that point.

By the time I was 18, I was wrapping up making money by taking it from adults to beat the shit out of under age people I went to school with (gang related and they didn't want to get in trouble, and hell whats the worst that could happen to me if I get caught? I was a minor), they all deserved \*this is just how I felt at the time\* it and it was my only outlet. It was shit like, kids stealing and the owners wanting revenge cause a family member seen them with the stolen property at school. Or someones dad wanted me to scare the shit out of the daughters boyfriend. Shit like like that. The last time I did something like this for example - Some kid who was a senior ( over 18 at the time )had his stereo stolen. He gave me $50 to beat the shit out of the kid who did it ( 16yo ). He reminded me of the boy who raped me. When I punched that kid, all I could see was that fat piece of shit FMC. When he was on the ground, in the fencing position, I drug and slammed him around by is hair. Into the side walk. I picked him off the ground, while he was dead weight- and rubbed his head in the top of a chain link fence. I was expelled and arrested for assault. I tested out of High school. I have never ever been violent with ANYONE since then. All the way till now and I'm 36.

During my time in School, seventh through high school, I hated everyone. Fuck em. I had only 1 real friend and I had one crush on a girl. One. It lasted no less than 2 weeks of fantasizing before FMC learned about it. He didn't like it. He told David my best friend at the time (he had no idea FMC was fucking raping me and new him as a friend of my family) that I had made out with her. He knew David liked her. David, pissed from hearing this, asked Christian. Of course she denied it. It never happened, it wasn't true. I was now known as a Liar. She went to church and school with me. I was 13 at the time, so from grade school right on through to high school, if I went to church with you or school, I was a liar. So the one girl I've ever liked now labeled me and to everyone else a liar. My best friend, no longer, because now I'm a liar. This was what happened the first time I ever told another person I had FEELINGS twards someone else. One little bitty crush. Now - No social life. Destroyed. Home life also. Behind the scenes is a literal fucking hell. I liked girls. was being raped by a 300lb+ fat fucking boy. I hated FMC, after my last altercation with him I was close to or at 15. About a year goes by. No girls look at me. Small town. I don't like them, because they hate me, I lie about making out with em. I wanted to have sex though. To be clear, I wanted to fuck. I had been fucked. I wanted to have joy... Just once... So I had a plan. When I was around 16, doing the summer Super Job for my Grandfather, I paid a prostitute for my first sexual encounter that mattered because I wanted to know what sex was like with a woman. When I got back to Northern California after the summer job at gramps, I told my older brother and he called me a liar. I never told him anything personal up until recently because of that. now my family thinks I'm a liar, and hates me to.

&#x200B;

So at this point I am 18 and I fucking hate everyone. My dad also starts developing a mental disorder. He slowly is becoming mentally disabled. I figured, fuck him. Some karma.

&#x200B;

I decide to move out. My cousin, she moves in with me. I was growing weed at the time. Played video games. Didn't think.

She and I connected. She was the first person I ever felt ANY affection for. She didn't want to use me. She didn't want hurt me. She wanted to know why I was hurt. My head at this point of my life is just so fucked I think/confuse that with her romantically liking me. I did my best to sleep with her. She out of guilt, w/e let me. She knew nothing about my past for the most part and we did not grow up together.

I knew her from the age of 1-5, then met her again when she was 17. I, out of the fucked up need to want to be wanted by the ONLY person I actually had confused feelings for manipulated or talked or w/e my cousin into an incestuous relationship. I wanted to kill myself. I kicked her out of the apt. She moved in with my older brother and had a sexual relationship with him for about 3 years. I felt I was the one that fucked her in the head enough to do that.

&#x200B;

I was going to kill myself.

&#x200B;

My grandmother, the great grandfathers daughter had bad arthritis. She was a chef. So I learned to cook and take care of her. I learned that I enjoyed people eating and liking my cooking. This was the first time I felt ANY joy from someone else. People. My grandmother died when I was around 26. she killed her self, the pain was to much. I hate saying this but, I didn't really care. I love her... but I didn't care. At least she wasn't in pain....

&#x200B;

I felt nothing for anyone for a good period of time. No love, no hate.

&#x200B;

So until about the age of 27, I got hit on multiple times. I am not unattractive I guess. I was in 8 physical relationships in my twenties. 2 I sorta developed feelings for. I never asked any of them out. I never once told them I loved them. I never lied to them or cheated. They asked me out, they persude me.  Sex was a chore. I love sex in my head. I love to  masturbate . Watch a healthy amount of porn. But actually having sex..... ugh, I would rather  masturbate  tbh. Everything sex reminded me of two things, the only person I care for and still love like a sister now, my cousin; which makes me sick to my stomach because I felt I manipulated her into doing something horrible, and being raped in the ass by a big fat piece of shit.

With porn at least I can choose any nice loving thing that I want. I like scenes where you can tell there really into each other...  And I don't have to think.

\`

At 28 I was in love for the first time.  Met her at work.

&#x200B;

She started everything. I mean EVERYTHING. She broke up with her boyfriend AT work. Asked me out in front of him the next week. For 6 months she was in a relationship with me, for 6 months I thought we were together. For 6 months her and her old boyfriend who she was in a relationship with for more than 5 years at this point, used me to further his cuckold fantasy. When I found him literally in the closet one night in MY FUCKING APARTMENT that she snuck him into that day at what time I DON'T FUCKING KNOW, jacking off to me fucking his girlfriend who I thought was with me, I flipped out. My life is insane, WTF IS THIS SHIT. Melony thought I was going to kill them. I might've. She left, both naked, with my blanket, peeling out of the parking lot. I quit that job the next day.

&#x200B;

I want to kill myself. Have it planned.

&#x200B;

My father develops a bad health issue, compounded with his now mental age of around 7, his health his slipping. fast.

&#x200B;

I move in with him, the state pays for me to take care of him. I do nothing but play video games and smoke weed. I'm waiting. I tell myself, ""When he dies. I go to.""

&#x200B;

At 31, I leave the house maybe once a month. My older brother decides he wants to reach out cause I'm a ""little"" closed off. At the age of 32 He includes me in his hobby. At 34, I turned it into what might now be a carrier. I still take care of my father. I am not so sad anymore.

&#x200B;

I'm 36, I'm doing well at the job I can make into a career. I met someone. Another Co worker. And for the first time, no confusion, I have a full blown crush as an adult. She's nothing special to look at. Not ugly in any way. But my god the personality, her choice in music, so many things in common. Thinking about her makes me smile. She initiated the flirting. We chatted for hours and hours for weeks. This did not happen over night. She has been there for 7 months at this point, and about 2 attached at my hip when she had free time. Also the subjects she would bring up. She was very much flirting. So of course I tell her. No way can I have any regrets.

&#x200B;

So today I come into work and she makes no eye contact and shuts her office door. Witch is not normal. I ask her if I can talk to her about something later at lunch. We get ice cream some times together so I figured that would be the time. She just avoided and left me standing there after I asked if we could talk later. Didn't answer. So I asked her at the end of the day. Told her how I felt, and the last thing that I wanted was for her to feel weird at work.  Then she told me she has some one, and it's ""complicated"". I am almost positive, she likes another coworker. I see them text each other all the time. Didn't think anything of it till today. The thing is, yesterday I mentioned I might ask her out the next day joking around when I seen the other co worker in the parking lot, the one I think she likes. He doesn't work in the building with us. Hadn't seen or talked to him at all today. He Laughed when he seen me today at the end of the day when we clocked out. Pretty sure he told her the day before, it made so much sense after I thought about it. The way she avoided me.

&#x200B;

She wants nothing to do with me. Went from conversations, her staring at me when she thought I wasn't looking, to her actively avoiding me at work. In just one day. I went from feeling again. I went from finally feeling like I can open up to someone. I even entertained being normal once. I felt again for someone else ONCE MORE. This time it wasn't misplaced I told myself. I should have listened to myself when I told me not to even think like that. because it wont happen. It won't. Never in my life will I ever find someone that wants me for me, not to use me. Never in my life will I want the person that does. I will not be happy.

All I want for my coworker is to be happy. I don't think in any way that anything on both parts was malicious. I think it's just terrible timing. Or this is hell.

&#x200B;

I think I'm done. Thinking about headed to sleep.  I will check tomorrow to see what people have to say if anything... All I know is, I got to feel for once, and what I felt was what people do normally. I couldn't even once in my life have one thing ONE fucking thing normal. I can't be happy I guess. Fuck this world.

UPDATE- I made it home from work. While I was at work I felt comfortable enough to talk a LITTLE to a co - worker. Gave him a little perspective and the day was less award than I thought it would be. he helped just by listening. That being said, she still locked herself in her office all day so there was at least not to much awkwardness. Didn't have lunch with everyone witch is very unusual for me and left a little early so we didn't have to leave together. I just want her to feel comfortable at work. It's not her fault at all. Also everyone at work knows. Everyone including both my bosses thought the same as I did about my co-workers interest in me. One even asked the girl I liked I guess, ""how long do you think it will take before you two hook up?"". So I guess my mind wasn't playing tricks on me. Just wish she didn't play games. All I know is I can't choose how I feel and I bet she's no different. So I am just going to be myself for right now. Do what I do. Don't think, just do. But fuck, I'm still so fucking tired of being nothing, feeling nothing. At least today I felt like shit =) I mean, that at least is something...  


Another thing I will add is my older brother and I have different fathers and my cousin is not a blood relative of his. "
kfdi92,SuicideWatch,Police officer struggling with suicidal thoughts I cannot openly talk about.,"This is a throw-away but I intend on reading responses. I think I just mostly want to type and get things off my chest.

(TLDR; Who can I talk to about my strong desire to kill myself without there being an fear of repercussions?  Every outlet I find wants to know my location or my contact info before they'll talk to me.  I just want to call a suicide hotline who won't trace my call.)

I am 35 years old and live and work in Southern California as a Deputy for the last 10 years; I am no spring chicken.  My wife of 7 years and I have been struggling with infertility for 4 years now. lots of surgery and medication but no end in sight.  The stress of scheduled sex lives has absolutely taken a toll on us.  We're still very much in love, but its not the same.

In July of 2020 I had a fairly ""routine"" call involving child abuse that kind of pushed me over the edge. after the call I had a mental breakdown and I have been out of work since then.

I take 45mg a day of Buspar (my wife says it doesn't help me... I am not sure), Xanax as needed as prescribed by my DO (I originally took....alprazam? but had a rare side effect and had to stop).  He has asked that I see a psychiatrist but the next avail appointment is mid-January. 

I digress...

Because of my line of work, if I talk about suicide it can be... well... career suicide (no pun intended).  So I keep all these thoughts absolutely bottled up inside and have to act like I am not having them when my therapists asks about it.  My therapist is provided by work and specializes in law enforcement issues, which is nice at times.

I think about killing myself... hourly? I usually wake up 1-3 a night in the middle of a panic attack.  I cannot get away from this pain; its almost a physical pain. I have specific plans on how I would kill myself; the works.  I think about the entire process in detail often.  When I drink I usually come so close to actually doing it that I really fear its only a matter of time until it happens. Which is so ironic to type out.  Clearly I have reservations about killing myself when I am in the right state of mind... but when I am in the wrong state of mind it sounds like a realistic idea. I am physically exhausted from all of this I genuinely want the pain to end and I not seeing any answers on how to make it happen.

I want to talk to someone about this WITHOUT putting my job on the line (being put on a 5150 hold in CA means I cannot carry a gun and therefore... yeah...).  I am so heartbroken and frustrated I just don't know what to do anymore.  Every day seems like groundhog day.  I desperately want my wife to leave me because she deserves better; it would make it a lot easier to end my life if she hated me.  I have completely gotten rid of social media and blocked my parents out of my life for no really good reason.  What a downward spiral the last few months has been.

Who can I talk to about my strong desire to kill myself without there being an fear of repercussions?  Every outlet I find wants to know my location or my contact info before they'll talk to me.  I just want to call a suicide hotline who won't trace my call.  I really think I will end up killing myself within the next few months, but ironically I don't want to talk to anyone who might be able to stop me. This is so backwards.

bvuvhb,SuicideWatch,Nobody genuinely wants to help you in the real world,"If you start getting depressed or lash out, first thing they'll think of you is you are dangerous. They'll look for a solution in mental institutions, medicine, restraining - anything to keep you from doing harm. 

They'll call you selfish for bringing hurt to them by trying to solve your own hurts. To them, you should suffer in silence and never exist.

The stories in the movies, books, etc. are all wrong. Humans are selfish, first and foremost. Jesus does not exist in real life. And no, he will not come to comfort you or understand you in your darkest moments. Nobody will, that's why it's just a myth.

To them, you're just an animal. A human turned into a zombie, that needs to be taken out. Your emotions aren't valid responses to your environment. To them, you are broken."
l8ntfb,SuicideWatch,"My life isn't BAD bad, but I don't see the point to living. It just feels like I'm wasting away. But I don't want to kill myself either. I just want to vanish, or maybe fall into a coma.","I'm probably going to sound like a terrible ungrateful person for saying this but, I just don't want to deal with anything anymore. My family is okay, had some arguing here and there but nothing abusive. I'm currently in uni with decent grades but also a whole lot of stress.

I've had suicidal thoughts for at least 8 years now, most of the times they come and go, but recently I've been starting to feel like things are pointless. I don't want to end up in a low paying job in this broken economy, doing the same thing from day till night, rinse and repeat. I hate having to deal with expectations of people and myself. I hate feeling like a fucking failure who can't get a job because of volatile emotions. I hate dealing with people who expect everything but pay you sheckels.

I don't see the point of carrying on anymore. Sure, there will be good times, but even during the good times I can't feel anything anymore. All I can feel is just neutral or depressed, and all I can do is pretend to be alright, all smiles, maybe play a fucking idiot to put on the act that all is well and I'm an upbeat cheerful person, or I'll just get into more trouble and even more depression. I feel like nobody I talk to will understand, and the people I've talked to all just say ""I've been through worse and I'm fine"", and I'm sick and tired of hearing that.

I don't know what to do anymore. I just want to fall into a coma, but that won't happen anytime soon. Sometimes I just wish my brain wasn't this volatile and would take a chill pill, but a therapist is out of the option since they're very expensive and because of the whole covid situation.

I don't want to be a burden to anyone anymore. But I don't know what to do.

I don't know. Thank you for reading though. Deep down I still wish that everything will be okay, even though I hate holding on to false hope.

Edit: It feels surreal to wake up and see that people have responded to this. I don't really know how to feel about this, but, thank you? I'll try to respond to the comments."

c79p5n,SuicideWatch,"I asked last Saturday if ""Anyone there"" ? You answered. Thank you. I was half way through my suicide attempt.","I was on this site last week and need someone that I didn't know.  I'm not doing well lately. I have a toxic abusive relationship, I cannot find a shrink to save my life (Literally. ha), I'm going through a divorce, my soul mate died (dog), I'm having to move states, find work, find a new home, and am living with my parents as of my psychiatric hospital release the day before yesterday.

I had been half way through, and had 2 methods essentially.  I took a medication to make it so I wasn't scared to do it. In the closet I was in, I had my phone, I'd already filled out my suicide note, and dictated in my legal will and burial details what needed to be done. I wanted to go forward.  I can't now, but think if it were again ... I would have not called for help but just let one of the methods run its course and go to sleep. I wouldn't wake up again. I am still ok with that idea.

I stood in the closet and had a fraction of a second that I was sobbing trying to pump myself up and asked if anyone was here.  It didn't save my life, but it gave me a second to think that wasn't thinking about the problem, it was writing and reading. I put \*\*\* \*\*\* down. I called my husband (STBX) and was taken by ambulance.  I was put in a hospital for a 5 day week and am now at my parents house. Everything is locked up, I have no access to anything. I don't have my car. I'm safe.

but Thank you. I wanted to tell someone what happened. I need to feel less confused about it and why or if I'm a risk, or if I'm being dramatic. I can't tell. But I can't talk about it at home. I'm sad and embarrassed to be here.

gseo1a,SuicideWatch,I quit.,"I quit. 

I can’t do this anymore. The world has gone to shit. My life is a mess. I can’t keep going anymore. 

I have no career prospects. No skills. No savings. No real home. No hobbies. No friends. There’s nothing to do and nothing to live for anymore in my life. Nothing to plan or to hope for. I’m not going anywhere and I’m sick of pretending that one day, somehow my hard work will pay off, because it never does and it never will. Fuck it all. 

My partner is a fucking nightmare to be with and is totally self absorbed and unsupportive. And swings wildly between a neurotic stoner who looses it like a skittish racehorse incapable of negating basic daily life or totally callous and cold and removed. No in between. She completely sabotages EVERYTHING I try to do for myself because she’s to fucking lazy and content with living like shit to make a change in her own life and ruins any resemblance of order I try to make for myself. 

I hate my shitty life. I hate the cunts I have to sit on the phone and “play nice with” selling shit they don’t need all day while being screamed at day in day out for less than minimum wage. I am rejected from every “good” job filtered and processed by AI I and pretend I want just so I can have a basic rate of pay that is financially viable enough to live off or god forbid, save. I looked at my CV the other day and I might as well have said, “fuck me up the arse for money” and I would have had better offers. At least then I wouldn’t feel so bad when inevitable some faceless corporation comes to emotionally, physically and financially fist fuck me in the name of profit margins and wildly conflicting agendas. At least I wouldn’t be so fucking surprised.

Everyday of my life is just one big joke. I put one foot forward and it’s just straight into the next biggest pile of dog shit. Constantly wading through piles of the next worst day of my life to the next. Pretending like one day it will be better but one day never comes.

I’m ugly, I’m fat and unemployable and scratch a bare minimum of making do throughout it all. Everything I love fucks up in the end and I hate where it’s gotten me. The vapid swirling vortex of fuck all. The purgatory of wearing this fucking mask, pushing boulders, breaking my back, tearing my nerves to shreds by the handful. Grating my bones to brittle twigs for some fat lazy cunt to get rich off of who doesn’t even know I’m alive. 

Then there’s the fucking world going to fuckkery... Honestly tell me what the point would even be anymore if I carried on and if by some miracle should somehow be falling out of my ass, why bother? Pretty much everyone is dying of this fucking virus or moronically trying to spread it further with their woowoo fucking cunt faced conspiracy shit or out of sheer ignorance desperate to give one another a death sentence via coughing fit. Even if that should somehow be solved within the next 6-8 months, the worlds still fucked and passed the point of no return, waiting for the seas to boil the life out of them, the ice caps to melt, the animals to rot from inside out and the world to goatse itself into a complete inhospitable prolapsed wasteland or, at best to wander around crippled by its change and ravage with mask and life support donned, picking our way through the mess for scraps.

Fuck me, even if the world doesn’t fuck us up, the socio-economic buggery will be the equivalent of throwing a brick into the middle of a crowded bar fight. Police and totalitarianism on the horizon, double speak, riots, food shortages, poverty, fake news, social unrest, the slump of everyday life as we know it cracking its skull on the wall behind and dribbling from its mouth as it sinks to its fucking knees.

I don’t even feel good about having kids anymore... What’s the point? Their lives will probably be worse off than my own. Maybe they too will bemoan and rue my “millennial” generation for their selfish, narsasstic, self-titled “irony”. Maybe they’ll find it in their hearts to forgive a generation of people who’s entire golden existence gave them the gift of the word “selfie” and social media that harvests their data for shady governments. Maybe they can overlook the fact that I cant afford to send them to school or home them in a house and feed them because I simply can’t make enough. 

What will I tell them when the end finally comes and they ask me “What did you do to stop all of this?”... What will I say, “oh yes darling I know we now live in a filthy pile of rags under a bin in a environmental nightmare but we had banksy make up a load of pithy little tee shirts to raise awareness and subtly undermine the futility of the modern world. Isn’t that great?!” And then we can all die from a poison gas cloud melting our lungs into grape jelly.

So what’s the point? 

Honestly? Can anyone give me a fucking reason because at this point, I KNOW it doesn’t get better or easier. I KNOW that my life will just be one lurch of shit to another. I KNOW that none of this can get any better for me, I’m ready to quit. 

I have some beta blockers and a beer, I don’t want to sit around and wait anymore. 

I can’t do this. I can’t hold on. I can’t make it better. It just doesn’t go that way for me and I hate it. I don’t want to suffer anymore and be stuck poor and making do anymore. I can’t. Everyday I am stuck inside and just waiting for the courage to not be a pussy and eat all the meds I have. Who knows I’ll probably fuck that up in the end too.


Edit/Update: 

Hello dear gentle people who heard me and gave me such kindness when I was so low and lost. 

I am alive and yesterday morning I woke up, quit my shitty job and with the day finally to myself, I did something that I didn’t actually ever consider I would do being dyslexic and generally very pessimistic... I wrote a short story. 

Now it’s probably just all purple prose and rambling and dog shit but I was so moved and inspired by all of your sweet remarks of my rants that for once in my miserable little life I believed in me. I finished something, I saw fit to try for once. 

My partner is still an absolute cunt and so completely far up her own arse she might be wearing herself as a hat. I believe now this is probably because of her addictions or her god awful personality that metronomes quickly from toxic, incompetent and dumb to victim mindset mired in lack  of the cursed sickness “melodram-pathetism” and not ever changing. 

For the moment I’m still with her. She’s still emotionally distant and completely unself aware. I will see where this goes but I don’t have a huge amount of hope for her. I have a separate bank account so might indeed save up to get my own place away from everyone including her, even as a temporary measure. I am acutely aware of how little time I have really had all to myself and how little control I have in my life and it has become very clear, almost painfully so, that if she doesn’t care for me then I think she shall not fight for me. 

Until that point. I want to write. I feel like I need to live for something and that my writing can help. If anyone has and tips or pointers for assistance for where and how I can share my work I would be eternally grateful. 

Thank you all for helping me, and to all of those who reached out to me and found themselves in the same curled, gnarled words I put up here; I am only too sorry that there should be others that have to feel in that same way. Which is probably much more saddening than my rant in itself really, that so many more like me feel that way. I’m sorry you have also felt like this. I wish you all the very best and thank you again for your warmth and love. 

Take care."

But at the same time, lately I’ve caught myself thinking/tricking myself into believing that I want to die.

Today I saw my grandmother and haven’t hugged her for a while because of COVID but I did today because I thought “well, soon I’ll be gone so I should hug her one last time”

I was sitting talking to some friends and felt really sad suddenly today because I “realised” that I’ll “probably never see them again” 
Holding my friend’s baby ... “he’ll never know me” 

And I’ve been having intrusive thoughts whenever I’m near anything that could be a suicide strategy - steep cliff, long rope, medications, sharp objects, train, fast traffic. “You should ...”, “you could...”, “why don’t you...”.

I know that I don’t want to die. But I’m scared of the thoughts I’m having and I’m scared I’ll lose control and do something.

I also don’t want to hurt myself, but I do anyway because I can’t control myself. Cutting - (recently started again after not doing it for 10+ years)

Talking to people about wanting to kill myself just makes me want to do it MORE after the talk because of this kind of crap. Shut up and atleast have some empathy. You're supposed to put yourself in *my* shoes, not myself in *your* shoes."

Eventually my arms gave out and I started to dangle and suffocate. I saw people in my life that had died and I saw all the great memories of my life flash before my eyes. Right as I was about to “go out” my leg began to swing up and reached a ledge. It was my last strength. I pulled myself up with my remaining core strength and leg strength so that I was parallel with the bridge. This gave me room to breath again. I swung my arm up and around the rail so that I could attempt to take the belt off and I knew I only had one shot at this. I was successful, but my body gave out after the belt was free and I dropped into the water.

Depression made me dumb, uninteresting, made me stop reading books, made me stop learning, caused me to spend days like a zombie, caused me amnesia, literally caused my brain to shrink. But the worst was the effect it had after 15 years of fucking my brain. Now I lost my mind. Now i lost that quirky weird fun personality. Now i have lost the cultured nerd that i used to be. I had to grow up getting bullied for being a nerd, for being weird, for not poisoning my mind with mindless activities and TV.

Then I grew up and I lost all of those qualities that were supposed to make me have a cool life and cool friends finally. I wanted to be in the art community, going to talks and book readings and exhibitions and come back from it open a bottle of wine and drink it around the aged wooden table which stands in the middle of the living room that is surrounded by weird and classic paintings, contemporary sculptures and talk about philosophy. I was supposed to be the cultured smart weird but interesting guy. I WAS THAT GUY. I was born to be that guy.

But depression fucked me. And for the past 5 years I had set the goal to become that person again. The real me. But i have not only failed but I have rotten even further. Depression is a disease and has to be dealt with early on, otherwise there's no point in living like a half vegetable, high on antidepressants during the day and sleeping while on benzos at night.

I lost 2 women I truly loved due to my depression. Due to them thinking that I was that cultured smart creative and deep thinker, only to find out I had nothing to talk about, I wasn't able to form arguments, wasn't able to debate on topics, hadn't read many books, didn't know anything about art or culture and was simply boring and dumb to them. It's my worst nightmare come true. People ditching and telling me I'm uninteresting. This was NOT SUPPOSED TO BE my life. I deserved to be loved and experience that love with her after years of patience, years of pain and sorrow. I persevered. I don't accept this anymore. I tried to change but it doesn't work. I can't read anymore. My brain is fucked and I've literally lost so many IQ points that i don't understand what people tell me. My brain is too slow. And while reading i forget the sentences i read after a couple of seconds so I can't connect them and comprehend the story. I live in the moment. I can only hold 5 seconds of life in my mind. I lost my creativity. My ability to imagine and see while my eyes are closed.

Oh my god we would have been so perfect for each other. She is my female version. I am her. And she is exactly the person I wanted to be. Maybe that's why I love her so much. And as mad and hurt as I am for the way she treated me, I really can't blame her for not wanting me. I wouldn't want this ""me"" either. But it hurts so much because i know how i used to be. I know how my life would have turned out without the depression. Its so fucking painful. A family member killed himself a couple of years ago and that was less painful. It was shocking but this daily constant pain, this living through my nightmares is unbearable.

I'm bipolar, I have so many demons inside my head, even with meds and therapy, sometimes it's unbearable and then I start a travel inside my mind, where I think about the idea of not existing, I won't be here. The pain, the traumas, I'll become just a memory...But I also have to leave the good things behind, like my favorite music, movie, my cats...It hurts, it's like I'm running out of air for years, suicide is there, it is an option, the final one...At the end of the day I just want to quiet my mind, that's all I need.

I almost did it myself a few months ago, but I was able to resist the urge and stick around a little longer. I planned everything and I still have that exact same plan in my mind. I have the equipment and I can do it whenever, but I seriously am trying to fight the urge. It's tough. 

I felt better in the morning but during the day I have started to dissociate more and more, and right now as I am writing this, I have no clue what the fuck is even going on. I don't even know if what I'm writing makes sense, but I am trying my hardest. All I can think of right now is death. The thought of taking my own life gets me full of excitement and makes me feel almost complete euphoria. I held the rope in my hand today and just couldn't stop smiling. I tried tying the rope around my neck and adding a little pressure, and I loved the feeling of not being able to breathe and my ears starting to ring. Not being able to think. I have a red mark around my neck from it. I have been suicidal since I was a kid ( my mom even told me that she once found a suicide note I wrote when I was 7-8 years old ) but I have never been this close to actually doing it. I have swallowed some pills in the past but nobody knows about it and I know that I really wasn't ready to die back then so I wasn't trying seriously. 

The more the years pass, the more suicidal and unstable I become. Taking my own life doesn't feel like a fantasy anymore, it feels like a reality that is going to happen sooner or later. It doesn't even scare me in the slightest anymore, I have just come to accept it."

Not being on the constant brink of breaking down and wanting to die is a completely foreign concept to me. So weird."
7jypro,SuicideWatch,"Best friend killed himself, I want to join him","My best friend killed himself at the end of September, and I still can't handle it. I'm 28/f, and he was 30/m.

He was the most amazing person I had ever known, and he told me once last June about his plans to commit suicide. I tried to support him, but he killed himself months afterwards. I know that, as I was at the time, I couldn't be the reason he would want to live, but it hurts so much that he left me. He was the only one who would or could help.

I called him crying very late one night, when he had a test the next day at 8 a.m., and he came over and spent the night with me and then took his test on two hours of sleep, and aced it because he was a genius. How am I ever going to find a guy like him again? I loved him, but I never told him, and he died all alone, feeling like he was unloved.

I've cried every night since he died, wishing I could join him in death. I can't feel anything for anyone else. He made me feel beautiful and loved and cared for in a way I never thought was possible. Now he's gone...forever. I'm such a failure. I failed him. I never made him feel like he made me feel. He used to put his hand on my cheek, and tell me that I was the most beautiful and perfect girl in the world to him. Now, I pretend my pillow is his hand as I cry myself to sleep.

I failed him. I was insecure and had intimacy issues, and I never told him how he was the most beautiful man in the world. He was everything. He had led such a hard and tragic life, but still he found the strength in himself to take care of everyone he cared for, including me. When I told him my father had sexually abused me, I expected him to run for the door. Instead, he held me and told me that he accepted me and loved me no matter what, and that I was still beautiful to him. I'm sobbing, remembering the unconditional love he gave me.

I can't exist without him. I reach my arms out into the air sometimes when I'm trying to fall asleep, hoping I can feel his arms around me again. Why didn't I tell him that I loved him? Why did I assume I would see him again? I feel so guilty. I just want to feel his love again, and to smell him as he hugs me. He gave the best hugs in the world.

I just want to die and be with him again. I want to tell him that I love him.

Shane...I love you. I'm so sorry you died alone, and that I wasn't there. I'm sorry you died feeling like no one loved you, because I do. If only I had shown you what was in my heart, maybe you would have stayed. I'm sorry. I love you with all of my heart. I know you wanted me to live, but I can't without you. You were the only one for me, but I was too stupid to let you in. I'll see you soon, my love, which is the first time I've called you that.

l7fm3s,SuicideWatch,I’m a robot,"In middle school I developed anxiety about showing emotion. I thought if I ever laughed or smiled someone I would tell me I was ugly and worthless and that I don’t deserve to so I never did. In 8th grade a group of boys in my math class said I acted like a robot and had emotions and they were scared of me. My ex boyfriend, when I stopped crying over his fake suicide attempts called me a robot. My boyfriend recently called me a robot which is understandable bcoz I hurt him. I cry everyday, my emotions flip so fucking crazy fast and intensely I fear I have bpd. But somehow I’m still an emotionless robot to people and for some reason it makes me cry so badly."

hg9dja,SuicideWatch,Fuck google,"It pisses me off that when I go searching for information on how to kill myself effectively and without pain all I get are half assed 'don't kill yourself' pages. The internet used to be a source of knowledge and now it's just a bunch of fucking brands and shameless self promoting content creators and seeing it makes me want to kill myself even more.

My fucking mother called the cops on me for saying I had suicidal thoughts once, so no: obviously I'm not going to talk to you about literally anything. Fuck you for making me exist without my consent.

I miss my dead pet. I can't stop picturing her dead, and covered in her own shit.

My fucking wife cheated on me. I read her emails, she was logged in on my PC. He straight up calls her a cunt and a fucking whore. That's who I got left for. I'm a fucking joke, I've been cheated on by everyone I've ever had a relationship with. She took out a credit card in my name and now I'm harassed every single day by people trying to get money from me. I'm in debt and I have no way out. She fucked this dude and now she's producer on his film. Can't wait for that to come out. I feel like everyone is laughing at me, the manlet cuck who got btfo.

I have intrusive thoughts about my genitals being mutilated all the time that cause me to physical wince, that is when I'm not literally spasming, probably from Parkinsons which runs in my family. I say shit out loud unconsciously like: ""Fucking kill myself"" and ""He killed himself"". I jerk myself awake at least once every night.

I cannot see anything getting better from here. It hurts every day and I'm filled with impotent rage. I've worked hard for so many years and I have nothing to show for it, and every day is worse than the last. My brain yearns for lead but this bullshit country wont even allow me the decency of a firearm to end this fucking charade. Will probably use charcoal."

Today, it was because the waves were too big for me to ride. I told myself I was lucky to even have the time and opportunity to surf. It eventually gets better with conscious effort to change my perspective, but then some other small inconvenience comes up and restarts the cycle. I want a technique to make it not start in the first place. I don't want to die right now, but I can't stop thinking how comfortable it would be to give up. I hate myself when I feel sorry for myself, which results in this crazy internal struggle, which overwhelms me and makes me want to give up. Any help will be appreciated. Thanks!"
d02wvf,SuicideWatch,"If I test positive, I’m going to kill myself.","I’m getting tested on Saturday. It’s been a rough life, i cant finish highschool, my anxiety for testing for HIV is sky rocket, and I feel like a failure. Nothing in my life is going my way and I’m only 18. I havent been taking my meds (stupid i know) so i constantly worry about everything, and my suicidal thoughts are through the roof. 

I was sexually assaulted in June, he did put a condom on but that doesnt help or ease my pain and take away the fact that someone I trusted enough took advantage of my body and raped me.

I’m more suicidal than ever, my anxiety is off the roof and I’m scared to have sex again because I’m afraid that my rapist gave me HIV. I will never live with myself and I can’t tell my friends or the boy I’m talking to. I have nobody, no support and I’m afraid to go get tested on Saturday bc i hate needles but it has to be done.  If the test results come out positive, it’s the end for me bc nobody will love me and I’m just a dirty worthless piece of shit. I wish i never existed. And I’m in so much agony and pain and stress, my (then clear) face is breaking out and making me feel even worse.

I don’t know what to do and I’m scared and i feel hopeless. I feel like death is my only way out.

UPDATE 9/6/19: So today I found out he has a girlfriend who he got pregnant. And he already has a kid. So he has two kids now. My anxiety is a little calm now because I’m sure if he had HIV they would have it and so would their kid and knowing his babymother, she would have him in court and tell the whole school about how dirty he is. But it also makes me upset because he just has raw sex with any female and decided it was okay to rape me knowing he doesnt care about the consequences. I could’ve been that pregnant girl. I hope to god he used the condom correctly and that he doesnt have any incurable STD. But that still doesnt erase the fact that he abused my body and now I don’t love it anymore. I’m still disgusted by my body now and I feel dirty ashamed.

I wish this would all end. I think I might kill myself soon. I can’t focus on life rn when all of this is happening."

cfx2gc,SuicideWatch,Suicide is like a security blanket,The thought of suicide always gives me relief whenever I feel like everything is going wrong. I could easily get rid of myself and I would no longer have to participate in this shit existence. I can’t imagine actually growing old.

cfez6x,SuicideWatch,Alone,"We hug goodbye at the airport. You make your way to your boyfriend, waiting for you upstairs and I get into my cab. You're going home where you'll break open your bags and spill presents unto your mum and your boyfriend. 

I'll stumble into my house, lay my bags to one side so I don't trip over them then fall on to my bed. I'll pull the covers tight around me and at the back of my mind, pretend it's a hug. I won't think about tomorrow, how I'll need to get up and clean the house somehow. I won't wonder if I'll have enough strength to get up and cook myself lunch. 

While your family takes you to brunch and you tell them stories of our trip, I'll turn on the TV because the silence kills me. 

It's not that I resent that you have people. I just wish I wasn't so alone. I wish I didn't go back to an empty house all the time, I wish there was someone to say ""welcome home"". I wish that it isn't just Google for me to talk to at home. 

When I'm sick, I become so vulnerable. Broken body, broken spirit. The loneliness eats up at me even more and I wish I could smash everything around me, pick up a shard of glass and rip my skin open- let it out. Let out every thing inside of me, all my pains. Watch as the pain flows out of my veins.

I want to walk out to my balcony and sit on the rail. Feel myself sway in the wind till I find the courage to let go, to fall to freedom. Feel the wind knocked out of my lungs as I become empty empty empty of all the darkness inside my soul. The wish for my skull to crack open on the pavement then maybe everyone can understand how much darkness lives inside my brain. 

I want to breathe it in, any gas that slowly seeps away my life. To feel myself falling asleep for the last time and my demons lay down with me, we'll never wake again. The demons all nip at my heels as we make our way to hell but they can only run beside me, no longer a weight on my shoulders or pulling me in so many directions. 

If i have to be alone tonight, I wish it could be for the last time.

Edit: thank you for the gold, kind stranger!! 
And thank you everyone for your kind words. I'm glad my piece connected with you all and sorry you feel such loneliness too."

ie25dh,SuicideWatch,Is it normal to think about death all the time?,"I think about death all the time. I think about how, after my mom passes, I’ll die. I think about sending my boyfriend and the dog away to visit his family, and then finding new homes for my cats, and then just ending it. I know there are people other than my mom who love me, who would be sad if I died, but they’d move on eventually. They have other friends and family. They don’t -need- me.

I tried to tell a friend recently how I’ve been feeling, and she told me that she needed me, her best friend, to live for her. Which is a lie. She has a loving fiancé and tons of other friends. She would be sad, but ultimately my death would mean nothing, even to her, after some time. She doesn’t need me.

My boyfriend, he might need me, but I don’t feel like I’m good for him. Not when I spend nearly every waking moment wishing for my own death. How can I support him when I can’t even support myself? He moved very far  away from home to be with me, but he is probably better off back home with his family, in an environment where he is actually comfortable. He might need me, but that doesn’t mean I’m good for him.

I don’t want anyone to need me either. I want it to be okay to die after my mom passes. I don’t want to spend another 30+ years struggling on this earth. I never even imagined I’d make it into my 30s. To make into my 60s? Impossible. What’s the point?

Life just feels so meaningless. Even when I try to find meaning, I always hit roadblock after roadblock. Depression and anxiety always hold me back. I’m so tired of trying, of fighting, of being. I feel like I’m just waddling through life, surviving via distraction, waiting for death."

gnalip,SuicideWatch,Going from suicidal to very happy all in the same day,"I feel so lonely because I've never found anyone else who feels the same way. I have depression and ever since the really really bad times I've never quite related to any other depressed person. For example fake smiling (never had to do that unless I was on the brink of tears at school) I genuinely felt happy but I was still depressed.

Most of the times I think of suicide when a minor thing bothers me. Like when a friend unconsciously leave me out I think of suicide and I start tearing because of suicidal thoughts. Just minor things. I can be pretty genuinely happy beforehand but a minor thing happens and I'm emotionally unstable. Or one day I can be sure I just want to die and the next I can feel like I'm on top of the world. I also mainly get depressed when I'm on my own and not with friends.

f42zm2,SuicideWatch,Anyone else badly want a relationship but know it’s a terrible idea,"How could having a relationship be a good idea when most of us on this thread are probably really unstable, some getting their thoughts out, some contemplating ending it, some already having decided and making their last remarks.

I don’t think life has a meaning but I do think love is the closest thing that means the slightest to me. The only times in the last 3 years I see shimmer of light is when a potential romantic interest arises. The feelings are different to those of friends of family for me. Selfish to want it or engage when you sleep for 16 hours some days, don’t respond to meds and are very unstable. One day having made plans to end your life, the nest cancelling them. Being paralysed in bed another day. All those sorts of things make relationships unattainable and daunting for people like us.

So unfair and angering. Everyone deserves love, especially those who are suffering and suicidal. I feel we deserve it the most but we can’t feel it like other people because our mind is torturing us and convincing us we don’t deserve it. I’ve turned down girls for poor and unresponsive multiple mental illnesses. Will continue to do so until my health is stable which is as likely as me winning the lottery. Heartbreaking"

I’ve thrown up constantly and haven’t stopped crying. I spent my entire days and nights with him. My days are going to feel so long. There is no point in living. I have no purpose.

With that said, I think I'm just done with life. It's been building for awhile and it just keeps building. It doesn't have much to do with the Coronavirus or the Riots but those have been the final straws. The Coronavirus has taken away my ability to even attempt to make new friends, try new activities or even do things I enjoyed like traveling and playing tennis. Luckily workouts have resumed in my state so I can do that. The riots have taken away my love for sports and history. It seems like everything I love slowly but surely is being taken away from me by various forces.

Even the activities I enjoy I don't enjoy as much as I used to. I feel like all they do is temporarily dull the mental and physical pain that I now feel constantly.

The Coronavirus has shown me just how hollow and empty my life has become. God is definitely not in my life and I am angry at him for various things (that I'll get into here in a minute). I am single and I have no kids or even pets to keep my company. While others at least had family to keep them company I've had no one. This Coronavirus pandemic has officially isolated me. Most of my family live in another state and I would be hesitant to travel for fear of getting them sick. Plus my nieces wouldn't see me anyway, they've bought into all the fear.

I have failed so often at dating it's become comical. I decided to get back into dating with stuff opening up. I went on a date on Tuesday that I thought was going well. We played mini golf but then, according to her, her perfume started messing with her allergies. We didn't have any food or drinks after the round as she felt like she needed to go home. I contact her Thursday where she tells me that she's been seeing another guy for awhile and that they have decided to be official and she wants to see where it goes. Needless to say I sent a nice little message to her, nothing rude but telling her I thought it was pretty low to have gone on a date with me knowing I had no chance. Like so many other times in my dating life I just felt used.

Besides being single with no kids or no pets I don't have a lot of friends. The few I do have know I struggle with depression at times and really do try to help. They all think I'm a very good guy who's just had bad luck and they truly believe I'm a good guy who deserves love and happiness. I just don't know if it's in my cards at this point.

Besides that my body failed on me pretty early. I'm 35 but my body started failing on me around 30. Always had high blood pressure that was hereditary. Now I'm slightly overweight, have hemorrhoids occasionally and also suffer from allergies and eosinophilic asthma. I was on a flight to Nashville back in 2017 (2 hour flight) where my throat really dried out. I started to panic which then caused my asthma to flare up. No medical emergency but it was a horrible flight. Now my doctor has me take a Xanax 0.25mg tablet before the flight to relax and a Prednisone 50mg tablet to control the Asthma. It's worked but whereas I used to love flying I now dread it. I feel like it's destroyed my ability to travel, I don't want to fly for longer than a few hours. But there's so many places I've wanted to see. I've asked my doctor about it and I've asked a Pulmonologist about it but they don't seem to take it seriously. I think they think it's all mental for me at this point. Ever since I became afraid to fly it's destroyed me a piece at a time.

So besides my body betraying me my mind has betrayed me as well. I know I've suffered from some Anxiety like I mentioned but even my therapist won't officially diagnose me with Depression. My mind is always half empty and I think my physical conditions have caused my mind to deteriorate.

All in all part of me truly wants to believe in reincarnation. That we get multiple chances at this life and that I'll just get another chance. I know Christian religions don't believe in reincarnation but it's one of the few things that gives me hope. I will say this, I think God made a mistake having me be born during this time. I believe I was born in the wrong time.

I have a job that's a good job but it's ultimately a dead end job. I've never been one who had that light click on in terms of a passion. I've always been adrift in terms of what I want to do. Yes I have a Bachelor's Degree with a double major in Management and Marketing. I also have my SHRM Certification as a Certified HR Professional. But if I'm honest I don't have a passion for any of it.

So my personal life is a mess. My physical health s\*cks, my mental health s\*cks. I don't have many friends and my dating life is an absolute failure. I feel like a lot of my passions are being taken away from me one by one. The Coronavirus is going to make it impossible to make new friends. The Riots have shown me that a lot of country hates me for my very existence. They hate me just for being a white conservative male.

I am a walking contradiction. I don't want to die and don't have to guts to but I've lost most of my will to live. I've wasted my youth, my best days are behind me and not in front of me and I no longer have any zest for life. Deep down pretty much nothing makes my happy anymore. Sure some activities dull the pain temporarily but I've lost the ability to feel happy. I've lost the ability to connect with people. I've lost any ability to have empathy or compassion. I just feel like I don't care anymore.

I don't know what I'm asking for out of this, I just had to finally get it out. I really don't know what to do at this point. If I could I really wish there was a ""do over"" button that we could press and start again. I wouldn't make all the mistakes I've made in my life. I would try to not be so da\*n introverted when I was younger which made it hard to make friends. I would've traveled the world before my health made my ability to travel by air an iffy proposition. I would've tried more activities to maybe find a passion.

I don't anymore guys. It just all feels so hopeless. If I had to use one emotion to describe myself at this very moment I think that's the one I would use. Hopeless.

Feel free to reply with what you want. I'm alone again on a Saturday night anyway. I've got nowhere else to be and nothing better to do."
i38h2a,SuicideWatch,I am going to end my life tonight.,"If this ever reaches anyone I know I’m sorry you saw this side of me. I won’t be leaving a note, it’s mundane in my eyes, the I’m sorry please forgive me bullshit. Everyone played a role in it, one way or another. I wrote my wrongs, I will die with no regrets. I told my best friend and ex boyfriend how I felt, made up after the argument everything is fixed and at peace. I will die tonight and that will be okay. I wonder how many people will come to my funeral. This is my last cry out to the universe, I’m so fucking tired of fighting. Bipolar disorder and PTSD fucking eats me alive day after day. Medication has made me a fucking living zombie. I want it to end, there is no winning this war. Life is not beautiful and my movie script that was written was a disaster to live through much less watch. I hope he comes to my funeral and says goodbye to me, I told him how I wanted to go out and I hope he follows through with my plans, fuck rotting 6ft under forever until everyone forgets about you and your headstone is just a sad reminder that everyone is forgotten. That’s all I will ever be a forgotten piece of body and mind, I do not matter, I am a cluster of atoms making up an organism. I will go back to the stars where I belong I wasn’t made for this world."

I'm worse than just all that though. Because im an airhead and I dont have good social skills. I'm always saying or doing something stupid. And it makes me more awkward. I act like it's all good and I'm happy and it doesnt phase me. But that is so far from the truth. 

Every single day I'm plagued by thoughts of how weak I am and how I'm annoying and how I'm a bitch and ""I need to die"" over and over and over. Which turns into ""I wanna kill myself"" over and over. It's getting worse every day. I dont expect help. I just needed a place to vent."

My psychiatrist is uncooperative and nasty. 

I have to avoid anything exciting (like music), so I sleep 15 hours a day if I can and browse sad subreddits the rest of the time. Can't focus on TV or books, feel restless because of the pills (a side effect that is more common than my weird music insomnia thing). I can't live like this."

Trust me, I’ve tried my best to keep moving forward in this world, but it’s all been pointless. I have no fear of being dead; I just struggle with the natural human instinct of fearing/avoiding pain. If there’s one thing in this life that I’m sure of, it’s that I want to die and it’s not a fleeting thought. I think about it the majority of every day.

The fact that so many individuals in the comments feel similarly is heartbreaking. Some of us are not fortunate or strong enough to go on living. Some of us have been beat down by life one too many times. I wish that was not the case, but unfortunately it is. It’s really saddening to see. But I sympathize because I feel the same."

dem5tu,SuicideWatch,I got a gun to kill myself and my parents found out about it before I could do it.,"Hello, everyone. Pretty long rant ahead so grab something if you care to read.

I'm a 17-year-old dude, I live somewhere in North Africa, I've been dealing with mental illness for more than 3 years now. I'm kinda traumatized because of all the bullying I've been dealing with since I was young, I don't really get bullied now but I can get verbally hurt as I can't really deal with the other party due to the lack of my social skills. Anyways, I didn't have any chance to make a good long-term friendship in my short life. Mostly, they get bored of me or I just push them away. I decided to go to a therapist because those problems were affecting me in a very bad way and distracting me from studying. But it didn't help much since the therapist wasn't that good. I decided to cut myself and do other forms of self-harm, whether it's starving myself or purging whatever I ate, etc.. A year later, my parents noticed my unhealthy behavior and decided to take me to a psychiatrist, I was diagnosed then with Schizophrenia and Severe Depression, I began to take medications and they helped me a lot but the side effects were taking away a lot from me, my memory was and still pretty corrupted and I wasn't able to do everyday activity, in addition to blurry vision, vertigo, etc., I was in the last year of High School and exams came so I stopped going to the psychiatrist. I got a really bad grade despite doing my best, I stopped taking my medications cold turkey. I went to a below-average college and my mental state is really declining. I was able to get a pistol but my parents found out about it. My plan was ruined and I'm under some kind of suicide watch. I really can't take it anymore, just everyone telling me to ""Man up!"" and ""A lot of people are going through worse"", I'm also kinda guilt-tripped.

I just came here and wrote this from a throwaway account because no one really listens to me, most of my ""friends"" can't really be relied on, and I felt like taking this off my chest. Thanks to whoever read the whole thing."

hdnxbg,SuicideWatch,Throwaway because I deserve to die.,"I a 24 year old male was raped by an attractive woman in my university my sophomore year. 

Edit: It keeps getting buried in comments I have no insurance or no employment I have 300 dollars to my name & have inquired about planned parenthood and urgent care testing it’ll be around $200-$250 to get tested without insurance and I simply can’t afford that right now. Plus planned parenthood in my area is not testing until July.


After it happened I dropped out of school and couldn’t explain to my parents why I came home why I was so unmotivated. 

the people I told my story to couldn’t believe a black guy in the military could be taken advantage of by a petite white woman.

Today while getting out the shower I noticed a single red bump in my genital area I had shaved the area a few days ago so I figured it could’ve been a razor bump.

I’ve been disgusted with my body since the assault happened so I’ve avoided sex since & I’ve gone from weighing 130 pounds to weighing 162.8 lbs and ordering takeout nearly every night eating the pain away.

After a drunk night and letting my anxiety get the best of me I decided to become a webmd doctor and self diagnose myself and the bump on my penis looks like it could be herpes.

I’m so afraid to get myself checked because if it’s herpes my life will be ruined I’ll never have a normal life again no man or woman will want me & I’ll be forced to be alone.

I’m already a college dropout on the way to 25 years old unemployed 

At this point I’m a failure in life and when I get the balls to get checked out if it turns out he herpes or something incurable I believe the best course of action is to immediately remove myself from the gene pool and get rid of this disease the only way I know possible and kill myself.

No one deserves to live like this & no one deserves to get this."

f5b189,SuicideWatch,Casually suicidal?,"I would love for things to stop. Time to hold still and so slowly fade. Suicide will never be that peaceful.
I think abt death often. I don't necessarily have plans for life. I'm just patiently waiting for death. Like at a bus stop. I might read a book to pass time but my destination is so peaceful I can't help but to want to go there. 
I'm constantly afraid. Of everything. Feeling silence would be amazing

Point of this? Idk I never told anyone this cus they would worry but I feel like i need to. Don't worry tho~ most likely I won't be taking an active role. I've desired death even stronger than now and I've been too afraid. So.

8r97s7,SuicideWatch,I was born a hermaphrodite and I want to die because of it.,"I don't even know how to put all of my thoughts down properly here. I've been having terrible emotional breakdowns lately and I have no idea if talking about it will even help. All of the problems in my life are directly tied to a condition I was born with and how I've been treated because of it.

Based on what I know, when I was born my biological sex was ambiguous and doctors tried to have me surgically ""corrected"" into a female. My parents have denied knowing anything about it, but they refuse to let me have access to my medical records even though I'm an adult. The only reasons I have information about it are because of scars, genital pain, and hormone/ internal ultrasound testing from my gyno.

Nothing about my body is sexually correct. I have breasts, but I have male pattern chest hair and pubic hair. I have what should be a vagina, but it's actually just a small hole so narrow that I can't even use a tampon, much less have sex with it. I was born with a phallus, but they shaved it down until it was the appropriate size to be a clitoris. It hurts a lot now, even as an adult. Its like a terrible stinging sensation that gets so bad sometimes that it's brought me to tears before. I can't even touch the left side of it because it stings and burns so badly. 

I've always known that something was wrong about my body, even as a kid I knew that certain things weren't right and that I didn't feel the way that other girls did. My parents refused to acknowledge it and hid everything from me.

My parents were very rigid about gender roles when I was growing up and they punished me whenever I didn't behave like my forcibly assigned sex. Most of my earliest memories are of me crying because I was forced to wear dresses, makeup, and necklaces. I vividly remember begging my mom not to pierce my ears and spending my whole childhood wishing my ears would close up again because wearing earrings made me feel deeply sick.

When I got older, it just got worse. My parents wouldn't let me have hobbies or join clubs that they thought ""weren't for my gender."" they stopped me from doing even simple things like learning to play the trumpet. They refused to ever let me cut my hair above shoulder length and would only let me wear clothes that were ""girl colors"". If I did anything that deviated from what they wanted, they would scream at me and call me a faggot or a dyke. Even now as an adult living in their house they do this, and they've said physically threatening things like ""You're not too old for us to spank you."" 

When I turned 18 I started having serious medical problems. I ended up with an exceedingly rare kidney disorder from a hormone imbalance that came from the surgeries I was forced to have as a baby. I nearly died from it that winter, but still my parents told me nothing about my medical history. 

I didn't get diagnosed until I was 20, when my pain was getting so horrific that I had to quit school and my job. I went for my first visit to a gyno and she told me that I was abnormal. I felt like a complete idiot when she told me. My parents had always pulled  me out of sex ed in school, and I was raised in such a strict religious environment that I sincerely had never seen what anatomy was supposed to look like.

And I felt so broken and stupid then. 

I was so scared of what would happen that I didn't tell my parents anything that my doctor told me. I had been dating my boyfriend for years already and I was so scared to tell him that I waited months before I said anything to him either. 

I just feel like such a failure. I was never even remotely happy as a woman, but I know that my family, my boyfriend, and everyone else could never accept me as a man either. And I've never felt like a man in the first place. I've always felt like I was something between that, even as far back as I can remember. But I know that people could never understand that. Even someone as loving, patient, and kind as my boyfriend can't fully understand how deeply this hurts me.

I feel so completely alone in the world. I feel mutilated. I feel like a disappointment to my family because I can never be what they wanted physically or emotionally. I can't take the pain anymore either. I'm constantly peeing blood and my kidney feels like a knife in my back. I've been suffering from depression and dysphoria since early childhood, and years of therapy haven't helped me. 

I just want it to end. No more talk from my parents about how my entire existence is a sin. No more feeling like I'm a horrible mistake. And no more feeling like it's going to destroy my relationship and hurt the only person who ever truly loved me. 

I wish there were a way to fix this. I wish my parents had left my body alone and raised me in a way where I could have been myself. But now I feel so lost and alone that I don't even know who or what I am.

kue8ba,SuicideWatch,I really really don’t want to but I don’t know what to do,"I’m not sure this is an appropriate subreddit for me to post in about this. 

I don’t want to die or end my life but I feel like I don’t have another option. I constantly think about it. I just want to be free and released. 

I am 30F. My parents are in their mid to late 60s. I lost my job back in March because of corona. My mother had a stroke last year and needs constant help with everything. She’s also always been codependent. My father has Parkinson’s and is getting worse slowly. He has always been and continues to be belligerent, verbally and light physical abuse. I am the oldest of 3. My siblings also live at home but one is physically disabled and one is very mentally ill. 

I barely get 5 hours of sleep everyday. I constantly go back and forth between taking care of my mom and dad and brother (mentally ill disabled). All bills are on me. Our house is at risk for foreclosure. The house is in my fathers name and I can’t do much because of that. I can’t get him to stand long enough to go to the dmv to renew his ID so he can go to a notary. 

I also have an auto immune disease that degenerates your spine slowly but thankfully it’s very slow and I’m still able to do a lot just with chronic pain. I just wish so badly that I can just live for myself. I want to wake up and just solve my own problems. Worry about only myself and feeding myself etc. I’ve never had a chance to live life for myself. I’ve had to help my parents since I was a teenager. 

I can only see things getting better once my parents both die but that’s not happening for at least 15 years. I love my mother and don’t want her to die or feel like a burden. She’s trying to do physical therapy and recover. I get so jealous when I see other people my age just being their age. Living on their own, only having to worry about themselves. Only cooking for themselves. Able to do self care and able to go to work. Even if I got a job I will probably lose it because I would have to call out a lot to take care of my family. 

We cannot afford a home health aid. I’ve tried with the insurance they won’t cover it. I’ve tried to get paid as my mothers home health aid; they won’t cover that. I have constant anxiety. I just want to be able to worry about my own problems and take care of myself. I just want my own life. If I’m lucky maybe I’ll be able to start living when I’m almost 50 years old. 

I don’t want to commit suicide because I know of the beauty in life. I know it’s possible for me to be happy. I just don’t see a way out alive right now. I didn’t know where else to post. Anywhere else I’ve posted I haven’t had any replies. If you’ve read this, thank you. I wish you a good 2021. 

I appreciate any replies.


EDIT: I just wanted to edit this post in case anyone checks back. First off, thank you so much for all of the awards and replies. The response has overwhelmed me and made me feel less alone. I hate that other people are going through what I am but it makes me feel like I am not alone. 

Second, just to answer a few common replies. My family has been through social security and disability. My parents are literally dollars over the line set by the government for SNAP and other assistance. We have been denied many times. My sister receives disability but it took many denials and paying a lawyer in order to get it. It’s also a very small amount. My brother was also denied and a lawyer says mental health disabilities are harder to get approved. If anyone has info or has been through getting disability for mental health reasons (my brother has schizophrenia), please reach out to me.  

Recently we applied for disability for my mother and she was denied because of my father’s pension and not having enough working credits. My mom turns 62 in June so we are looking forward to her early basic social security and maybe being able to get her on Medicare. Her private insurance through my dads old work (he’s retired) doesn’t cover paying me as a home health aid or even hiring a professional home health aid. I am hoping that’s something I can do through Medicare when my mom can get it.


My father recently got Medicare but after doing a screening with a nurse and everything they say he doesn’t qualify to pay for a home health aid. My father has his good days still and loves to hide his abusive and weak side. I tried to get my father into a nursing home but he doesn’t meet the criteria. In may my father stayed at a inpatient rehab after a fall, for about 2 weeks. I told the social worker all the issues going on. I told the doctor who asked why he was on psych meds, that he was abusive and I didn’t want him to come home. That I didn’t want to and couldn’t care for him AND my mother. That his moods were unstable. The doctor offered nothing, wouldn’t even change his meds or offer a plan for discharge. No one flinched at me saying I can’t care for him or that he’s abusive. They simply didn’t see it as their problem to help. Even the social worker. 

I have tried getting snap benefits for myself but because I live with my parents they’re included in the household. I also forgot to mention I live just outside of NYC. So our mortgage is very expensive as you can imagine. 

I am sorry if I rambled. I’m trying to get out and remember all of the details. The most important thing I have to say is THANK YOU. To everyone that awarded, replied, messaged, and even just read my post. I promise you I am NOT going to kill my self. I don’t have plans or ever make or think about plans. I just felt hopeless and felt like no one else was listening. From the bottom of my heart thank you to this subreddit."
ii1lf3,SuicideWatch,I want to commit suicide as a means of escaping adulthood.,"There are a lot of new responsibilites and expectations that come with being an adult, none of which I think I can handle. I’m a pathetic mess of a person who barely manages to acomplish the most basic of tasks, there’s not a chance in hell I could live independently, keep up a job and manage my money properly in order to pay expenses and just general living costs. If anything the fact that i’m 20 and still living at my dad’s place only solidifies that point. I should be responsible for myself at this age but i’m not. So maybe I should just die instead to avoid further embarrassment."
dnb9qt,SuicideWatch,I'm jumping off a building in a few hours to end my pain.,"I never knew the worst case of depression is when tears are no longer flowing in your eyes. Since last month, I've been taking high dosages of antidepressants hidden from everyone but myself. I had no one to rely on, my bestfriend gets mad whenever I speak about my anxieties, saying that she's afraid to be with someone who is mentally and emotionally unstable. I can't speak to my parents about how I feel because they just tell me that ""Everybody has problems"" and force me to keep going on with the routines I should be doing. I just want to shut down. I have no self-esteem left and I have never felt this way before. This is probably going to be my last reddit post. I left home earlier today ready to do this. I've been told that I'd go to hell when I die, perhaps it's time to go and check it out."

dxbjnh,SuicideWatch,Do you ever just want to talk to someone about your suicidal feelings but then anxiety grabs you by the throat and chokes you until you have a breakdown?,"I’m autistic so I’m very prone to the classic ‘autistic meltdowns’. I feel like my condition stops me from being happy and normal, instead I’m viewed as very weird and obsessive.

People in the past have scared me enough to barely talk verbally nowadays. I know if I were normal, I’d be happy and successful. No one will accept that my condition has made me a failure.

Yet I can’t talk about it to anyone about this, I just end up exploding and then overdose on my sleeping meds (nowhere near enough to kill me, but enough to knock me out pretty fucking hard).

dpk4de,SuicideWatch,if anyone reads this thank you,"I can't take It anymore. It's all so overwhelming & no one is listening. I've been practically alone my entire life, I dropped out of school In 8th grade because my anxiety was so severe I just couldn't couldn't go & no one cared enough to make me go. Which means i'm an actual idiot, like incredibly stupid. Honestly I cant even remember how to multiply or divide, It's humiliating. At that time my mother abandoned me along with my siblings at my grandmothers to chase after her boyfriend she met online 8 hours away.  Around this time I got really depressed & cried everyday for like 6 months. I barely ate & stayed inside my room all day with only a TV connected to a cable box to keep me company. I didn't see her much for a year after that. That is until she came back & took me along with her to this small town that I'm in now. I think I've spent all my time on the internet the last 5 years because I've been mentally incapable of anything else. Which means I can't drive, I don't have any friends, family or let alone a job. These are all things I've dreamt of practically all my life & they're so far away. It's becoming unbearable at this point. My mother & I aren't on good terms after she had to make my brother leave because he hit me & I called the cops on him. I don't have any money right now, absolutely no family, no friends & I live in a small town without any real opportunity's available. I'm living off my mother & the minute she decides I have to go I'm going to be homeless. Recently I've been begging her to take me to just get an id & help me apply for jobs. She keeps ignoring me & I know this is my problem but i don't have any money & I don't know what or how I'm supposed to do it. All I'm asking for Is just a job so maybe I can figure things out but I can't even have that. I fucked up & now it's too late for me. My only option is suicide which is inevitable but I'm scared & I want to live."
bodzsr,SuicideWatch,Therapy was the worst thing that happened to me,"A few years ago when I was suicidal I was lied to by my therapist and told we were going to the hospital for an emergency prescription change. At the time, it made sense. But looking back I feel like such an idiot. 

As I got to the hospital I was honest about how I felt suicidal, but made no plans to commit suicide, and had no method. The doctor told me that soon he’d have a discussion with me about what would be best for me. The second they got me a wheelchair I knew my mistake. I shouldn’t have been honest at all. They all lied to me. There was no discussion, no prescription change. They locked me up in the hospital and for three days I didn’t even know how long I’d be there. 

When I finally got to meet with the doctors there, they wouldn’t listen to me and continuously mocked me and treated me like a child. They were obsessed with stupid parts of my life and wouldn’t listen to my diagnosis I told them I already had (Episodic Depression or Major Depressive? I forget because it’s been a few years and we’ve talked about other things) what I do remember is that at the end of the week they said they diagnosed me with the one I already said I have, like it was new!!!! Like THEY diagnosed me and not my psychiatrist at college!! 

One of the stupid things they were obsessed with was my relationship with my best friend (who is a guy- I’m a woman) and I had to repeatedly clarify he was a friend and they kept trying to get more information about it. It was so fucking weird. Like they asked me who my support system was and I said, “my friends, like this girl, that girl, and Guy” and they’re like WHO IS GUY!!!!!!!!!!! Like it would be such an enlightening thing for me to elaborate on even though I already said he’s a friend of mine. 

I had made some friends while I was in there. Some I still keep in contact with. But worst was just that Im now thousands of dollars in debt from this whole experience. 

I had nightmares for weeks. The anxiety of being locked up completely against your will with no way to contact the outside world but a monitored phone did real damage to me. Having no privacy, no real clothes, being constantly treated like a child- it was all so terrible. 

It sucked. It wasn’t worth it. I’ve learned to NEVER tell a therapist you’re suicidal."
ca4ytp,SuicideWatch,Does anyone else have visual thoughts of their suicide?,"I have suicidal thoughts daily and visualizations of killing myself for the past 6-7 years (I am 21)
They're not really intentional just a reaction to the deep pain and stress I go through every single day of my life. It's a shitty learned hopelessness coping mechanism I've created to cope everytime something bad happens I can just see it"
l8hvi4,SuicideWatch,I was going to do it but called my aunt instead,"Two days ago I told my dad I was going on a run around the block even though it was snowing and freezing outside. I ended up taking a knife with me and just walked to my school and hid behind a trash can. I was going to cut my neck and wrists while I called my ex-best friend to ask her to stop me because I needed someone to talk to but she has me blocked I mean I have her blocked too so idk what I was thinking. But I just had a full on melt down as my tears froze to my face. I ended up calling my aunt. She didn’t really help but I ended up staying at her house and slept all day. Now I’m just binge watching Courage the Cowardly Dog. Idk, I’m tired. Goodnight."
i3g3j8,SuicideWatch,A follow up,"After downing more than 120 pills last, I spent most of the night asleep like a normal person would just what felt deeper. No ability left in my hands to use the gun laying at my feet, I was a plank of wood flat on the ground, that was until the the vomiting on to myself happened. I spent what felt like hours like that, the pain worsening, I felt at peace. It stopped all at once, I woke up to beeping and buzzing, my stomach had been pumped. 
So if you’re wondering if I’m still here yes, yes I am I’m just really fucking bad at killing myself. Next time, when I get out of here I’ll just go straight for the gun. I’ll apologize about the mess on a post-it. I always wasn’t one to make someone clean up for me but if I go out, that’s all I really care about. 
I’ll be in the ICU, until they know all my whatever the fucks are stable, I guess downing a bunch of anti psychotics isn’t safe, at least that’s what they told me. 
The worst part about this, is I just feel everyone on here will be happy to hear I failed, like this isn’t a throw away and these will probably be my only two posts, and that I will succeed one day. Maybe I’ll come back here for that rant, or maybe this was just bad luck. 
Anyways I’m tired from this all, I’m a fucking failure for a fourth time in a row. I hate this more than I think you’ll ever know. I’ll talk to you guys later."
ca9qp2,SuicideWatch,"In twenty six days, I am throwing a moving away party. I don't have the heart to tell my friends I am thinking about taking my life shortly afterwards rather than go through with my move.","It's strange to me how happy I feel now that I've picked the date. I feel at peace with the idea, but I haven't made any specific plans yet on the method.  


The reasons why I'm suicidal and why I'm moving are really similar. I feel so broken and tired. I've battled mental illness for 12 of the 24 years I've been alive. It's really drained me and robbed me of my full potential. Whenever I seem to find a little bit of calm in between big storms, things come crashing down. 

I'm a high functioning depressed person. I have an active social life. I have a good job. I have some good hobbies. I try to see a therapist and take medication. But deep down, there's a lot of darkness I carry. Nobody knows at work that I constantly question how I should take my life everyday, or if life is worth living. It's the first thought through my head when I wake up. When I've tried to open up to people, they treat me like I'm a burden or a liability. I feel so trapped in a persona that I've built for myself - I put up a facade of a happy and energetic person. I decided to set a date to move to leave everything behind and start a new life. But the big secret I carry is I don't want to start over.

I've really struggled. I've taken countless meds, I've seen a therapist for over three years. I've learned to lie to my boss or people close to me about how I've been feeling. I'm really tired. I tried to kill myself when I was 12 and got hospitalized. I thought that was a low point I would rebuild from. Six years later, when I was 18, my girlfriend hung herself. This year, I got diagnosed with bipolar II. I'm sick of countless crazy side effects from these psychiatric drugs. I don't want to keep having to try to fight this for the rest of my life.

So in 26 days, my friends will all get together for one last party. They'll say their goodbyes, and they'll make peace with not seeing me again for a long time. I think this is the time I'm going to do this. I could move 800 miles away, but that only brings me opportunity to just get hurt again. I don't want to live anymore. I love the people in my life so much, but I can't carry this anymore. I want to die so badly.  


I know this will break some people close to me. That tears me up so bad. But in the end, this is something I need to do for myself."
7cu84z,SuicideWatch,I cried tonight realizing that suicide was not an option anymore,"For most of my life, I have found tremendous comfort in knowing that suicide was a dependable way out when everything was just too much.  Like a safety net... but the opposite.  In my mind I would play out different scenarios -- some quick and practical, others more extravagant and poetic.  I would always get that same feeling of freedom that people do when they imagine winning the lotto.  It was a huge help.

Recently, I have been supporting my wife through a very difficult period of grieving, and tonight I realized that if I was to end my life, it would completely break her.  So now, with great sadness, I have had to say goodbye to my reliable friend and protector.  The future seems so much harder now.  Thanks for listening."

kg6ta5,SuicideWatch,My mom threw a knife at me.,"Context:  We were having an argument about consent. I always wear shorts at home and our house is pretty conservative and packed with family members, with a few older men such as my cousins and uncle. I always get anxious so I have this habit of bouncing my leg up and down. My mom scolded me about it multiple times, telling me to not do it because it means “attracting people to have sex with me” ( I am 16 by the way, the youngest in our household with the exception of my nephew). This time she was in a bad mood and unfortunately caught me bouncing my leg while wearing shorts which means my upper thigh is a bit shown. We were upstairs in the bedroom and she was using a small knife to cut off the straw from a box of groceries. The moment she caught me she fucking yelled at me saying that I was being a whore and stuff like that. I tried reasoning with her calmly and told her it was because I’m anxious about my school but she didn’t budge. She kept blabbering about what might happen if one my cousins or uncle saw what I was doing or the way I was dressed, they’d think I’m inviting them to have sex. I told her that just because I’m doing this does not mean I want to have sex because my neither my actions nor my clothing mean consent. She continued arguing about how they may be my relatives but they’re still “men” and added that she hopes I get raped so I’ll learn my lesson. I tried to counter one last time but then she fucking flung the knife right at me. She obviously missed on purpose but at that moment, my whole life fucking froze. She was fuming at me and said that next time I say things about consent and shit like that she won’t miss anymore.

Now, before I had been doing self harm and once even attempted to commit suicide. In those times, my mom was so hurt for me and kept telling me that my life mattered and all that shit. When I realized how much I was hurting her before I stopped no matter how depressive my state was. But now, my own fucking mother wanted me to die and hell, get raped. You know, I’m thinking, maybe I was right before. About just dying. Everyday I think about dying but I try so hard to stop myself from having these thoughts because I love my mama. But just when I’m starting to recover, my own mother wants me dead and literally fucking flung a knife at me. Sure, she missed but what if she didn’t? What if it didn’t kill me but left me fucking incapacitated? What if did really kill me? I was happy that I’m slowly getting better but right now, I might as well be better off gone.


Edit: Hi, so I just want to let you guys know that this was the first time I’ve ever talked about my problems at home. I don’t talk about it to literally anyone, even my friends and I do not have a therapist. I just wanna say thank you for all the support and I promise I’ll try my best to stay here. :D

Edit 2: Just wanna inform you guys that my mom has high blood pressure which might explain her explosive attitude but most certainly won’t excuse them. From now on, I’ll refrain from arguing with her for the sake of both of our health. Also, for everyone telling to hit up CPS, I appreciate your advices but our country’s CPS here is mostly for juveniles (correct me of I’m wrong) and like, rebellious kids I think and kinda treats them badly so I don’t think they’d do my mental health any better. Strange as it may be, my mom is the only parent I have left since my dad’s out the picture (another reason why I stopped trying to kill myself, I didn’t want my mom to be alone). She’s all I have right now and basically, all I can do right now is try to keep things as smooth as possible to avoid any more trouble in the future."

Edit: I had never been on this sub before. I typed suicide into the search bar after an intense breakdown. I wrote out my post and hit send. Force closed the app. I went for a walk with my son who’s under one. I forgot I had even posted this till right now while I’m sitting on the toilet a day later. I’m currently bawling my eyes out in relief. I am curious about the future. Today feels lighter than the societal pressures of yesterday. I am for lack of a better word overwhelmed by what an amazing community this sub is and I’m thankful for all of your support. Please keep pushing one day at a time if you felt anything like I did yesterday. For those of you asking, yes I have been through a tremendous amount of difficult lessons as I’m sure many of you have. I’m currently watching my mother battle her bipolar disorder while trying to raise a child hoping this won’t be his future watching me. But being rational enough to know mental illness is a constant battle. 

Thank you all again. I love myself. But I am exhausted. I feel as if I’m army crawling through life with bloody fingers.

lipdhb,SuicideWatch,My partner tried to kill herself yesterday,"It has been a tough few weeks. 

About a month ago my partner of 20 years told me that she thinks she’s gay. We have kids, a life, a hoped-for future. Now she wants to consider an open relationship initially and that long term thinks her future will be with a woman.

Then a week later she quit the professional training she’s been doing. Her whole life she has only managed to get short-term low paid jobs. She was 2 1/2 years into a 3 year process to be qualified in a professional career path. She would have qualified in May and been able to start getting paid work in that specialism. We’re left with the debt of the studies without the financial opportunity of the qualification. 

And then yesterday she tried to kill herself. She researched online how to prepare a noose and bought the kit. She went for a walk to a secluded wooded area near us. She had everything in place but stopped just short of the jump. 

Then she went and stood by a fast moving road planned to step in front of one of the large trucks that thunder along it. But again, couldn’t do it. 

Then she came home, got in the bath and started cutting her wrists. Drew blood but stopped before it was fatal. 

I was unaware of all this until this morning when she showed me her wrist and then told me about the other two attempts. I had to unpack the belt and rope from her bag. Untie the noose and hide it somewhere. 

I’m devastated. Numb. Terrified. I love her deeply. We have teenage children. We have a good life. 

I’m upset and sad for her that she’s so ill. Mental illness has attacked her for years. She’s on meds and has a therapist. 

And I feel guilty for feeling so angry. I know that what she needs right now is kindness, compassion and support. And yet I also feel a boiling rage at the shit that has been dropped on me. I know she needs the opposite of anger right now. 

I don’t know what to do. 

I know you can’t fix it. I just wanted to be heard."
byl475,SuicideWatch,"Does anyone get horrible, horrible heartache that literally is so physically painful?","When I'm sad, like really, really, sad, I get these sharp pains in my heart that are continuous and jerk tears. It hurts so much at times that it spreads throughout my body and I flinch and curl up in pain while my tears uncontrollably drop down my cheeks. My stomach hurts, and my whole body begins to ache, my head starts to pound and that's when I find comfort in the idea of ending it all - that there's a way out. Thinking about it gives me comfort. Writing letters to everyone gives me comfort. Until it feels real and it all comes back and I miss people that I love. I miss the way things were and I miss when i didn't fuck everything up. I miss when I was loved unconditionally."
buhe9g,SuicideWatch,My friends having a good time is driving me to suicide,"I know how stupid it sounds, but their lives are getting better and better and mine is slipping from my hands. I was feeling fine until a couple of days ago, then i saw them after a long time and they're just having fun, being social, meeting new people and being awesome all around. Meanwhile i get panic attacks in public at the thought of having to speak to someone.  
After seeing them socialize i just lost all hope, all my efforts don't matter if i'm too awkward to do anything with the results,the thought of having to see functional people like them again is making me crave death more and more .  
And nobody is gonna read this cause it's a a wall of text from a socially inept wreck, if you're on this subreddit i suppose it's cause you're going trough something aswell, i hope everything gets better for you"
lawwu3,SuicideWatch,"Hypogonadism (and the doctors who ""forgot"" to treat me early enough) is the reason I've had such a miserable and humiliating life.","For those who don't know, hypogonadism is when someone's body doesn't make enough (or any at all) testosterone. This has a range of effects on your body and it also affects your body in different ways depending on what age it starts.

As a boy going through puberty, the lack of testosterone caused me to develop breasts (severe gynecomastia) & completely inhibited any growth of my penis. Instead of getting testosterone shots ASAP my doctor decided to wait and see if I was just a late bloomer...

I'm 26 now and only now getting hormone replacement therapy in the form of weekly injections of testosterone & hCG but it's too little to late: my body is permanently child like and there are no medical solutions to reverse the physical affects. (I should probably also include that this stunted muscle, height and body hair growth)

When this first started happening to me the worst part was having to attend school every day as a male with boobs. The humiliation and anxiety I felt every day trapped in classrooms full of people who almost daily tried to rip my shirt off just to laugh at me is painful to think about even right now. I'd have to hide in the gym locker rooms as much as possible, I had to hide from everyone and everybody because even my own brothers would occasionally bring a group of friends just to humiliate me so even my ""escape"" from all this (locked myself in my room and played video games to distract myself as much as possible) I wasn't safe even in my own home. I completely stopped playing basketball even though I was so passionate about it back then. Still to this day I don't feel comfortable going outside to do shit as simple as go to the grocery store.

The worst part is that I still have this on my chest (literally) even at the age of 26. That means I've been living in a legitimate hell locked inside hiding from life its self for 14 years now. There are surgeries to remove the breast tissue and attempt to make my chest look as normal as possible and I actually did get this surgery when I was 13. Problem is my hormonal issue that caused this was never resolved, and my body simply kept making more breast tissue because I was still developing. Obviously considering how much this affects me I abandoned any idea of going to college or starting a career because whether or not it makes me a bitch I cannot handle being trapped like I was when I was younger. So I have absolutely no way to throw down $10k on a surgery that would at least resolve that part of my humiliation.

But even with all that said the thing that makes me want to kill myself the most is having a permanent childs penis and having nothing I can do about it. There are no surgeries like the gynecomastia surgery, there are no pills or methods to legitimately help resolve this problem. I already know what most peoples first reaction to hearing about my penis problem is because I've been told countless times it ""doesn't matter"". To me it does matter. I will never feel comfortable in my own skin, hell I don't even feel comfortable feeling like I'm my own gender.

Most people don't pay attention to this but when you're someone like me it's hard to escape this as it's literally everywhere - small dicks are brutally made fun of even in a society that pushes against body shaming. Frequently attached to the worst people of our society - I've seen people attach the notion that criminals and even mass shooters are the way they are because they have a small dick. Almost daily I come across people making fun of me indirectly in the most random places even on reddit, and even though gaming is my ""escape"" the communities inside them and sometimes the actual games themselves (borderlands 3 for example) don't forget to remind me what a humiliating life I actually have all the time. There were times where my own friends would make a joke about it and I had to sit there laughing with them, at my own self, just to not raise suspicion. Shit's depressing.

Before anyone does give me the cliche responses or offers to tell me it doesn't matter because of x y z, I beg you to think of how insecure & scared men are about their penis sizes even if they are entirely normal. They are SCARED by the idea that they might actually have a small penis, imagine actually living with one. I can't wear even the smallest condoms the FDA approves for sale, they just slip right off, and every partner (3 total) I've ever had we could not get penetrative sex to work at all. So my advise is to start treating my medical issue like a medical issue, instead of trying to be a hero through words when my experiences contradict every fucking thing said to me so far. I'm even infertile because of this disease which is just another thing happily taken away from me to ever experience.

All this being said I'm beyond hopeless. I've been trying to get help through any means possible for years now. 4 ER trips, 1 inpatient hospital visit and a suicide attempt later I am still no where closer to getting help even after seeing therapists, psychiatrists, endocrinoligists, urologists. All of them  are so obviously unprepared to deal with my situation that it's been abundantly clear that there is a massive lack of understanding or knowledge when it comes to treating people like me.

I don't have it in me to keep living like this, the humiliating and anxiety driven experience my life has been so far isn't going to end unless I end it. I tried as much as I could because I love the friends I have and the two girls in my life (gf & mom) love me so much but at some point I think even they will understand because they see what this is doing to me. I just hate the idea that this is going to hurt them so this post is my last effort to get the help I always needed I guess but if I'm being real with myself this is probably my suicide note or a way to get my story out there to people so this never happens to anyone ever again."
ht43ep,SuicideWatch,"16 years old. I went on a walk, and the light was golden on the trees that arched above me. It was like heaven's gates. It was like God telling me to come home.","Title. I'm thinking of ending it tonight. I went on a walk down to this lake by my house and God, it was beautiful. It was like one final send off from nature - almost as though in that moment, it had been put there for me. The lake was perfectly still, and that golden light was just gracing the tops of the trees. I'm not actually religious, but I think it was the universe's way of telling me to let go, to return to God.

I'm suicidal for a whole range of reasons. Have been for 8 years - half my lifetime. I've never come so close to ending it before. Something suddenly clicked a couple of nights ago and things became too painful to bear. The straw that broke the camel's back. I started cutting again. It didn't help. Nothing makes a dent in this pain and shame.

I can't tell if this handful of pills means I actually want to go, or if it's a cry for help. I know it's pathetic - but I think I'll only take 8, that's in the potential danger zone for people of my weight. It will be in the hands of the universe to decide if it's my time to go.

I just want someone to hear me. There are 690 people online. I hope someone's there to listen. I hope someone will maybe hold my hand over the internet if I go. It's a funny image, those hands reaching through those computer screens, but it makes me tear up.

I hope that if I succeed, someone else fails. Your life is worth something, if you're reading this. Mine isn't.

See you soon. I'll update this if I fail.

cgh5nz,SuicideWatch,My sister told me to kill myself (part 2),"Part 1 (Read first): [https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/cd8n23/my\_sister\_told\_me\_to\_kill\_myself/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/cd8n23/my_sister_told_me_to_kill_myself/)

Edit- Part 3: [https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/cjl0ro/my\_sister\_told\_me\_to\_kill\_myself\_part\_3/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/cjl0ro/my_sister_told_me_to_kill_myself_part_3/)

My sister, later that day, *did* apologize (because mom told her to) but it seemed as if she wasn't even sorry. Her ""apology"" wasn't even sincere. She was laughing, looking away, rolling her eyes, as if the whole thing was a fucking joke.

My mom told the both of us that the situation between us has gotten way out of hand, and wants to do family counseling. My sister started arguing with mom, saying how she doesn't want to make up with me.

So I asked my sister, ""Why are you mad at me?""

Of course, she didn't answer and ignored my question. I asked over and over again, but she didn't answer it.

The next day, I told my therapist that I tried to kill myself and she told me that I had to tell my mom. I told her, and she burst into tears. I also told her about all the hurtful things my sister said to me over the years.

Mom: Why didn't you tell me any of this?

Me: I thought you wouldn't believe me, because you and dad always knew her as a nice person.

Eventually, we had to tell dad about what happened. And for the first time, he cried. I've never seen him cry before. And it broke my heart to see my parents like this.

My mom scheduled a session with my therapist on 7/29/19 *with* my sister. But I'm worried that my sister will start lying to my therapist and will try to manipulate her to make it seem like everything was my fault. But my therapist says that she is trained to not fall for that, since she knows my side of the story.

I was told that her boss was going to be there, too, because she's only involved in a session if it involves *serious* cases, such as suicide.

Edit: Thanks for the silver!"
bvnt0e,SuicideWatch,"I just want to sleep and never wake up again, anyone else feel the same?","I'm  24 years old. On the outside I lead a perfectly normal life. I have a  decent salary, friends I speak to regularly, I get along with everybody  at work. I do have goals, ambitions and hobbies.

If  you ever met me, you would not have the slightest clue that I've been  diagnosed as Clinically Depressed. I've had multiple suicide attempts,  one which was truly close where if I didn't have the appropriate medical  attention in a given time-frame I would not be here. I've been with  Psychiatric Teams, and a few Therapists. It's all a temporary measure in  the end.

I am a 'High Performer' in my  workplace, and I have many who rely on me for support. I always smile,  and I try my best to make others happy whenever I can. But at the end of  every day, I feel empty. Most times I have suicidal thoughts. There are  people I am able to speak to and 'open up' about how I feel, however  you can only share how you truly feel one so many times before it  becomes a burden upon them.

In more  recent times, my negative thoughts are becoming more prominent. I have a  strong feeling I may be edging towards attempting suicide once again.  I've taken a few days off work hoping it may help, however I believe  with the absence of working it allows my head to fester these urges and  suicidal thoughts more rapidly.

There is a  brief moment of what I can only describe as insanity that grips me, and  it is at that moment where my life hangs in the balance. Whether it's  my belt around my neck, a blade against my wrist, or pills in my palm. I  have managed to so far overcome each mental battle in those moments in  these past few weeks, however it is likely I may soon lose.

I  am not here for advice or sympathy, the purpose for this post is to  just say Depression does not discriminate. You do not have to have been  through a traumatic event, or to have certain physical attributes you  hate, feeling alone etc. to be depressed. Sometimes you just are, and it  could be for no particular reason at all. We are all human in the end,  and we're all on the same spectrum. Best wishes to you all."

eax3lg,SuicideWatch,I want to commit suicide on Xmas Eve just like my sibling,"My brother killed himself on Xmas Eve  when I was extremely young. I still have very vivid memories of it, and the way my family handled it leads me to believe that it didn't really bother them. No one talks about it or mentions him. They have practically erased him from our family's history. Maybe it's because they were ashamed he was gay. Or maybe they were ashamed that he died of suicide. 

Maybe both.

Either way, I want to join him.. Now that I've grown up, I understand why he did what he did. I understand that he wasn't wrong, and I don't feel like I'd be in the wrong for doing the same... I'd be doing the world a favor.

I feel like my life has done nothing but spin out of control since I was a child. It's been nothing but chaos. I was preconditioned not to ever trust. I was sexually abused and pimped out to my stepdad's friends. My mother stayed with a known pedophile while I was relegated to foster care and group homes. 

I feel like I wasn't ever even just given a fair chance. Yet, I went on to get married once a upon a time. I had two kids. I got a divorce. I started a business. I got my bachelor's degree. I bought a house. 

...And then I became addicted to alcohol. 

I made so many stupid choices leading up to now, and because of that, I now have nothing. My children moved to another state with their father after the courts decided he and his wife were better suited to be their parents. And the courts were correct. I'm a fuck up. There's no telling where we'd end up if they were here, but it would probably be within the confines of a cardboard box. I've been sober for almost this entire past yea, minus maybe four or five total slip-ups.. I thought that might fix a lot of my issues, but it hasn't fixed a thing. 

I destroyed my last relationship. I hurt my partner in countless ways. After we broke up for a month, he begged me to come back, and I swore I'd do better or try to be better. I tried as hard as I could.. but I've had to accept that being a shitty person is just who I am. I can't change that about myself, it's embedded in my personality. I broke him into tiny shards of glass, and all he could do when I tried to pick up the pieces was hurt me back. I turned a good person into a horrible, conniving man...

I can't get the job I want. All of my stuff is in storage and I can't pay the bill before the storage place puts a lien on it and keeps it all forever - even the sentimental items like the gifts my children have made for me. Their ultrasounds. Their footprints from their first day alive... My car is gone now, too.. I can't drive to get to work. I can't drive to an interview. I can't drive to a doctor or a mental hospital. I live in the middle of nowhere, and I have no resources. I can't take on new clients and make money. I've fallen as far down the hole as I can, and there's no way back up.

I've had my friends tell me that I should be proud.. that I should just stick things out, because things will get better. But things will never improve, and I haven't felt like I could tell them to what extent my life has become unmanageable.. 

There is literally no way to return to the life that I worked so hard to build, or to better myself and actually do something meaningful with my art or myself as a human being. I don't have the money, I don't have the resources, and I am too afraid to ask my friends or ""family"" for help. 

I feel like they'd be far less inconvenienced if I just didn't exist. I feel like my kids would only have to face one big disappointment instead of a bunch of big disappointments throughout their entire life. I feel like all of the work I put into becoming a valuable human life was all for nothing. I feel like I am a waste of oxygen and space. I feel like all I do is destroy people, and hurt their feelings. 

I have no one. My mother and I are estranged. My remaining siblings and I hardly ever talk. I'm incapable of nurturing a relationship. I'm incapable of being a mother just like my mother was.

I have nothing left, and I have no more motivation to continue on.

I just want to disappear. I want it to appear that I just left without saying a word. No one would notice, because I have done nothing but isolate myself from everyone. I am so ashamed of my life and what it has devolved into, and I don't want to face anyone or burden them with my problems. I don't want to keep trying to fix something that isn't fixable. 

I'm a fucked up person in a fucked up world. People keep trying to tell me that I have so much to live for - that I have so much talent and potential. People keep telling me to keep trying, but they aren't the ones who have to try so it's easy for them. They don't have to live with me, I do. I hate who I am and who I've become. 

I know that I'm sorry. I cannot even begin to describe the remorse that I feel for all of my selfish behaviors, and my depressed demeanor that just brings everyone down. I wish I had treated everyone better: my kids, my kids' dad and his wife, my friends and my remaining family...

I'm everything that I never wanted to be - practically homeless, with absolutely nothing. I have no personality. I have nothing positive to add to the world. I've become so jaded to the thought of dying - like it's going to happen someday, so why do I (and others) keep trying to delay the inevitable? 

I'm sorry if this seemed rambley. I had considered writing letters to a couple of people, but I figure putting it here - anonymously - would be better. I don't want my kids to know I killed myself... so I'm going to disappear to a place where I will never be found. I don't want to tell anyone about it in case they try to change my mind. I'm afraid they'll think I'm just begging for attention. Or maybe they will think I don't mean what I say... but I really do want to die.

Thanks, Reddit."

dc7gh4,SuicideWatch,"funny when they say ""suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem""","when all your existing is the problem in the first place 
when  life is just one big pain in the ass

its so cold and boring and so so tiring
it's really dreadful 


some people do have temporary problems ...but the others have problems that wont be fixed 
like loss of a loved one or someone you love cheat on you or leave you alone

(( some people can't really get over these tramatic events happend to them not everyone can ""heal"" magically))
and like depression too...(some people tried EVERTHING to overcome depression but they failed)

so please stop saying that Really stupid thing to others who is at the edge of their lives
it will only make them feel more gulit and shame then they already do

jr06ib,SuicideWatch,All my affairs are in order. Just wanted to say goodbye to internet strangers.,"Hi everyone.

Don't worry, I'm not looking for any help.  I'm only here to get this off my chest.  

31yr old male here in the U.S.  My fiancé had an affair, and took our 4year son.  I only get to see him on Wednesdays and every other weekend.  I'm a very ""all or nothing"" kind of person. Same as my parents. As shitty as this may seem, I'd rather be gone that deal with the pain. 

I've spent the last 5 months setting this up, and I'm completely come to terms with my decision.  I always plan ahead, and I have set up a trust account for my son, an email address for him, a 529 account for college, etc.  My Will & last testament has been completed, and letters have been written, all photos have been transferred to hard drive and my apartment packed up and cleaned (lease up in 3 months).  I was even able to cross a few things off my bucket list in the last few months which was nice.

I've got a very discrete spot picked out that me and some friends would go camping at in college, and I've gathered all materials. (A ridiculous amount of heavy pain pills, 3 bottles of prescribed codeine/promethazine cough syrup to prevent throwing up, my favorite alcohol, and old car, and a gun just in case.  A little extreme I know, but I'm not afraid of dying....I'm afraid of surviving. 

I just wanted to thank reddit for always being there.  I'll most likely be painlessly surfing reddit and listening to a few of my favorite songs in my last moments in my car waiting for the carbon monoxide to do its job.

Godspeed"

This song finally gave ma a little bit of a good feeling, a big improvement after days of pure numbness, just enough to get me to call an ambulance.

I’m now in a hospital and the suicide thoughts are finally slowly fading away. I hope, it stays this way.

br7jos,SuicideWatch,I would rather kill myself than grow as a person,"I'm fucking done with life man. Life fucking sucks in every which way. I do not want to be honest about who I am. I do not want yo grow. I do not want to accept anything. I do not want responsible. I don't want to work hard or be a part of anyone's life. I don't want to make a difference or contribute to society. Having a career of any kind is too much fucking work. The truth is I'm perfectly happy to be a leech until nobody is willing to help me out. The. I'll logically be on the streets and at that point I will kill myself. But why let it go that far? Why shouldn't I buy a gun ASAP and be done with it before life even has the opportunity to force me to try being responsible and engaging in the world around me, when I want nothing to do with that? I'm a loser and I'm okay with that. Not being a loser is seriously too much work. Giving enough shit to learn useful things is too much work. I just want to kill myself before anyone that knows me figures out that I don't give a shit about my life or other people and I'm not interested in the least in being responsible in any sense of the word."
la20rd,SuicideWatch,I didn't do my schoolwork and I'm deeply regretting it,"Like many others, I'm stuck in my house with occasional online classes for 4 hours everyday.

First of all, I live in a country in Europe and I can only describe it as if you aren't the favorite by your teacher, boss and even parents, you're screwed. I was never a straight A student but I wasn't terrible either, more so I was slightly below average and all my teachers seemed to just pick and bully the students that weren't the best, and the students that were favorites could get away with anything.

Eventually, I decided I wasn't going to do my homework for today, then the next day, then the next, and next and I just stopped doing my homework altogether, now most teachers gave me a slap on the wrist, but my art teacher recently told me that if I don't send at least half of my art projects by the next week I was to stay in my current grade while the other students moved on to the next grade and that scares the life out of me because there is no way I could send that many drawings in such a short period of time and even if I could I would still get low grades which would make my parents scold me and give me the silent treatment for days, but if I didn't send the drawings I will still be in the same grade and I don't even know what might happen to me then.

I don't have many friends, even if I did have friends I wouldn't tell them that I've had depression for years because they would bully me and I know this because it's already happened once.

I don't want to die or kms, as I do have some things that make life worth living, such as my wonderful grandparents, plenty of youtubers, and games. I know that sounds stupid af but I just don't know what to do anymore and I'm scared :("

I’ve started texting this girl that I asked out and she of course rejected me because I’m a lowlife piece of shit. She always hits me up first and she’s the only reason basically I have any hope at all except deep down I know she doesn’t give a fuck about me and will never love a useless loser like me

Because of the fucking pandemic I don’t even have soccer, the only thing that kept me going every week, the only time when I feel myself and can express myself and don’t want to fucking kill myself. My best friend has just ghosted me the last few weeks and I’m completely alone, the only person that even texts me is this girl but she won’t hang with me and even if she wanted to she couldn’t because of the quarantine. 

I’m not gonna make it through 3 more weeks of this I just wish I had a gf who cares about me and would hold me close and tell me it’s gonna be ok and I wish I could say this stuff to my friends but I’m a man and I can’t show emotion or I look like a pussy, I just want to cuddle with a girl and be warm and happy I’m such a loser idk I just want to be happy again it’s been so long

f3fnz1,SuicideWatch,I want to die but afraid of dying!!!,"Death. Death. Death. That is all I can think of right now. However, I am scared of dying. The thought of the hereafter scares me to death.

What if in the final moments I regret my choice? Will it be painful? And finally: what awaits me after death?

As a religious person, it is not fun at all. Suffering in this world and the hereafter does not sound fair. I just want to end it all without burning in fire for eternity. But I am sure the fire will be my punishment if I were to commit suicide. But at the same time, I am suffering in this world. So really it all comes down to what is worse. I choose suffering here.

But at the same time not. I want to end it all. The shame, the struggle, the pain. Everything in this world I hate. There is nothing stopping me from ending my life other than the hellfire. Not even my loved ones. And I do not even feel selfish writing this. I am being honest.

Someday I am sure suicide will be my only option. Then the fear of hellfire will be gone. Even if it is not gone, I will be so lost and sad, losing my faith, and then I will commit suicide. I cannot wait for that day to come. I will then slice my throat open and, finally, put an end to all my suffering. Or, on the other hand, start a journey full of great suffering. As you can tell, I am contradicting myself all the time. That is because I am lost. And very sad. I want to die."
fsxvr5,SuicideWatch,Young doctor (29yo) with suicide thoughts,"First, thank you for opening the post. I'm sharing a bit of my story to try to prevent bad things to happen to me. Please share your thoughts or advise in life. Summary is that I spent all my life savings trying to get trained in the greedy USA healthcare system, but to this day after 15 years of formal education and experience, I continue to be unemployed and financially useless, now struggling with COVID19 lockdown, depression and suicide ideas. 

Young male physician here, 29 yrs, from Latin America (yes, we also use reddit) I've been having suicide thoughts, but not currently depressed. I feel like a fucking failure in life.

Since school I aced exams, test, scores, got honors on my graduation, was extremely dedicated, learned guitar, learned english, I was always either the best or among the best and had high aspirations. Went to the University at age 16 and I stupidly decided to study medicine and become a miserable doctor, let me explain. Medicine is a TOUGH CAREER, very difficult. It is academically, mentally and economically demanding. The amount of stuff you need to study each year is massive, and drains you mentally, socially isolates you from family, friends, parties, relationships, etc.  A dark truth of a recent grad is that you are bullied by superiors or more experienced doctors, pretty much everywhere, medical residency is like that and I seriously suffered that BS during my 1-year medical internship, at that time they evaluated me, so I had no word to defend myself. But I graduated after 8 years of traning (in my country).

Escaping common crime violence in my country, I went to USA to become a doctor there, by passing the USMLE exams (the most difficult exams ever in my life) I spent 2 more years studying for those expensive exams, and another year getting doing unpaid clerkships to get experience and recommendations and connections. Life in the US as immigrant if TOUGH man! Nobody wants to employ you due to visa. You cannot earn any money. I did cleaning, mopping floors, dog walking and other odd jobs to support me (WHICH IS ILLEGAL AS FOREIGNER). When I had all the requirements, guess what? You have to pay fees of applications to participate in the selection process of residency in the USA each year, so I spent $5000 only in applications and flying tickets. I received few interviews in hopes to get a job, but did not get anything, and lost $5000. I tried again next year and the results were the same with same dollars lost. I felt fucking scammed, and to this day i'm still angry at my experience in the USA.  I spent like $70,000 of my third-world-hard-earned dollars in the whole process, paying rents, bills and educational courses to prepare and in the end the result was nothing. NOBODY WILL EMPLOY YOU IN HEALTHCARE IF YOU DON'T DO A RESIDENCY FIRST, which I failed to secure twice. And NOBODY will employ you at any job in the US if you are not citizen. 5 stupid years wasted + 8 years of home training.

I came back defeated to my country in hopes to get any job. I faced another reality and that is there are no jobs for doctors here, there are just too many doctors today. I lowered my life expectation even more and looked for any other job available, but then COVID-19 happened. My country is in lockdown, I'm quarantined, unemployed, with no money, no financial power, living with now elderly parents at my old home with rampant crime (paralized temporarily due pandemic), living off the charity of others, unable to move, unable to sleep due suicide thoughts, and writing this. Most of my classmates became specialists or got married or got jobs or moved to other countries. I feel like i'm in the starting line. I'm now almost 30 years old, indebted, single and poor. I'm ashamed of what I experienced, I'm ashamed to say I'm unemployed and have never had a real formal stable job, and still hunting for one. I'm a miserable unemployed doctor.

 You want to make it worse? Law in my country requires me to serve in the COVID emergency pandemic when system starts to collapse, totally UNPAID or I could be charged a fine or brief jail time.   

Failure is the word to describe what I am. I hate myself, I constantly punish myself for making bad decisions and I blame my extreme bad luck and also blame the silence of God despite me being religious. Education was in vain in my life. The only thing that prevents me from commiting suicide is my parents, but after I bury them, I think I might take the shot. 

I'm sorry you had to read the long post, sometimes I feel I did nothing wrong: I studied, I graduated, I behaved, I followed the rules (and also the USA rules) did not became an asshole, murderer or alcoholic or anything, but still life kicks me in the balls. Then why can't I be offered a fucking job? I no longer care about medicine, I no longer care about myself, but I might care in what you have to say, please react to my life story. I will read you thoroughtly"
chvc2a,SuicideWatch,"I told my mom I'm suicidal, she forgot.","A few weeks ago I was doing a few chores with her when I broke down and told her that I hated life and that all I ever did when I woke is wishing something would kill that day because I'm not brave enough to do it myself, she called me ungrateful and I snapped and slapped her (It was wrong and I did apologize after it) she cried and that's where it ended. Today I broke down again and told her I needed help, she told me that I can talk to her whenever I want to Wich I answered ""Don't you remember what happened the last time we talked?"" She said that she did remember, that she remember how I slapped her, when I asked her if she remembers why I did and what we were talking about a that moment she just shrugged her shoulders and asked ""What were we talking about""

I'm crushed and seriously in danger of trying to commit suicide again, if my mom doesn't even remember that her own son wants to kill himself then she obviously doesn't care enough and if she doesn't, who does? I'm just a waste anyways."

My name is Hannah, I'm twelve years old

I love music and painting things and I was here once, too.

things with my family are messy. they want to love me, I think, but things can get in the way. I wasn't what they were expecting, even less so what they were hoping for. I know they'll be okay if they believe that they tried to fix me, and I hope the best for them.

 I hope everyone on here has a moment of luck for them, too, maybe one that ends up saving them from their own hands. Please just try, as hard as you can, because when you're too far gone you'll wish you had.

You are all worthy of happiness. I'm sorry life has treated you like it has, or if you're just somebody who tunes in on here to try and help, you are wonderful and appreciated. 

Try to look for the good while you can still see. I love you, hope I don't see you too soon."
kgaidi,SuicideWatch,"My BF thinks suicidal people are all weak, cowards and he has zero empathy for anyone who either wants to, attempts to, or has committed suicide (spoiler alert: I am sometimes suicidal)","This is really just a rant I have to get off my chest. I don’t even care of no one reads it. 

So quick background: I was clinically diagnosis with major depression, general anxiety disorder and OCD two years ago. Things got so bad I had my first psychosis episode and was hospitalized. I didn’t believe I had any of those illnesses and initially thought the doctors were all stupid and diagnosing me with BS. But at the encouragement of my boyfriend (who I live with) and parents, also later realizing myself the doctors were probably right - upon discharge, I agreed to obtain outpatient services and have been treated ever since with weekly psychotherapy and daily medication.

Flash forward two years - I’m much better - no longer having suicidal thoughts, can hold down a job again, intrusive thoughts are much less frequent and am starting to feel joyful again. 

One of the suggestions of my therapist was to try to communicate with my boyfriend more - it’s clear that we have some major unresolved conflicts and that may be a part of the reason why I have stress, depressive thoughts, and/or unhealthy anxiety. So I’ve been trying to have more conversations so we can work through major disagreements - but of course my boyfriend is resistive and isn’t fond of difficult conservations. (I mean, who is?)

I won’t go through every disagreement lol this would be a novel. But one of the biggest one came up (again) last night. I mentioned (off hand) that I’m glad I don’t have suicidal thoughts anymore. 

__Him:__ erm...that’s good but you had no reason to have suicidal thoughts in the first place.

__Me:__ well first of all I did have reasons...secondly I literally couldn’t control those thoughts - they were intrusive and I couldn’t not have them. 

__Him:__ can we not talk about suicide or bad/negative thoughts? I’m really uncomfortable with this topic. 

__Me:__ ok I know but that’s why I haven’t talked to you about this pretty much ever - and I haven’t even brought up suicide in two years with you.

__Him:__ ok so why bring it up now?

__Me:__ because you’re my partner you said we can talk to each other about everything. Also earlier you said you’re 100% emotionally supportive but I can’t talk to you about mental health and negative thoughts?

__Him:__ I _am _completely supportive but some topics are off limits for some people.

__Me:__ but this is important to me and a part of my recovery process is to talk to close loved ones about my mental health - my parents and most of my close friends also are uncomfortable with this, so you’re one of the few people left I could talk to.

__Him:__ so now your mental health is _my_ responsibility?

__Me:__ no I never said that, but you’re just not a supportive partner if you refuse to even let me say one word about it.

__Him:__ What? So now you’re judging me and calling me a bad partner because I don’t want to talk about a very sensitive topic??

__Me:__ well not in those exact words but... kinda.

__Him:__ Excuuuuse me??? After all we went through? After everything I did for you for the past few years? Cooking for you? Trying to calm you down? After me being supportive the whole time in the hospital and even after?? _I’m_ a bad partner?!

__Me:__ well actually two years ago you actively discouraged me from going to the hospital and said “there’s nothing wrong with you you’re not depressed.”

__Him:__ _how_ could I have known??!! I’m not a doctor!!

__Me:__ you could have encouraged me to go see one?

__Him:__ I thought you were just having a bad day!

__Me:__ I had a bad 12 months and I said I’m not sad I’ve had highly negative thoughts for over 6 months. I told you this before I was diagnosed.

__Him:__ Again, I didn’t know that was a cause for concern.

__Me:__ what about now? You’ve supposedly learned a lot about mental health in the last couple years you say - if a friend of yours told you they’ve been feeling depressive  for 6 months, would you encourage them to go see a doctor?

__Him:__ I don’t know. Depends on who.

__Me:__ Bob (good friend of his, not his real name)

__Him:__ umm probably not, Bob’s a pretty positive person and probably just having a bad period with work or something.

__Me:__ so...you wouldn’t even recommend he talks to a doctor. What’s the harm in that?

__Him:__ I’m not a doctor, and it’s his responsibility to go see one.

__Me:__ but you can at least be a supportive friend.

__Him:__ _How_ am I not supportive?

__Me:__ earlier you said I can talk to you another _anything._ I guess not actually _anything._

__Him:__ of course you can talk to me about anything, _ANYthing_ and _EVERYthing_ in the whole world!

__Me:__ except negative thoughts and suicide?

__Him:__ WHY do you want to talk to me about suicide? WHY? Are you suicidal right now? Do I need to take you to the hospital again?

__Me:__ uhh no...this whole conservation started with me saying I don’t really have those thoughts anymore.

__Him:__ So WHY are you talking about it THEN???

__Me:__ because my doctor said it’s important to talk about past trauma and talking about what it was like for me to be in a downward spiral. It helps me get even better.

__Him:__ ....

__Me:__ so...can I talk about bad thoughts and suicide?

__Him:__ ...

__Me:__ ok so two years ago I really wanted to kill myself.

__Him:__ see right there you lost me. Why? You had no reason to - you were a really positive person and super resilient to challenges you could work through anything.

__Me:__ it was an intrusive thought I couldn’t control. 

__Him:__ do you have suicidal thoughts right now?

__Me:__ no.

__Him:__ then stop talking about it. Talk to me when you do have suicidal thoughts. Then I’ll take you to the hospital.

__Me:__ okay...can I talk to you about negative thoughts that are not suicidal?

__Him:__ no because you should be talking to a medical professional.

__Me:__ okay but my appointment is not for another week, it would make me feel better if I talked to someone now.

__Him:__ you want to know my opinion? __Suicidal thoughts and actions are a sign of weakness. And i _despise_ weakness. It’s wrong and I have no empathy, zero empathy for those types of thoughts or actions.__

__Me:__ actually I’d didn’t ask for your opinion. I want you to listen to me talk about my experiences and just listen like a supportive partner would. You don’t have to give any thoughts or opinions. But since you did - so you think I’m weak, you despise me and I deserve no empathy?

__Him:__ no I didn’t say that.

__Me:__ ok so - you despise all weak suicidal people except me?

__Him:__ no you’re putting words in my mouth.

__Me:__ literally what you said.

__Him:__ see? This is why I didn’t want to talk about it. 

__Me:__ okay I get it. Talk to you about anything - except for negative mental health topics.

__Him:__ No!!! I never said that!!!

Anyway this went on for a while. Then I of course got angry and annoyed and said some not nice stuff I didn’t mean. As of this morning he is still mad at me. And just now he said - I harassed him all night, was cruel, intentionally tried to hurt him by calling him not supportive and trying to blame my depression on him. Also I need to learn to drop things, know what types of topics to not bring up with someone but oh btw - I can talk to him about _anything._

__Me:__ so can i talk to you about suicide now?

__Him:__ OMG! When someone says “you can talk to me about anything” you should know to just say “ok, thanks.” You’re not supposed to IMMEDIATELY bring up something they ALREADY said they’re uncomfortable talking about!

__Me:__ lol.

I’ve suggested couples counselling to him many times, and for years. He refuses. He says the problem is almost 100% with me and I’m the only one who needs counselling.

Honestly - suicidal thoughts from two years ago - mostly caused by being a horrible work place with a terrible boss, along with arguing with an unsupportive partner at home, with my parents who are also verbally abusive and dismissive of my health concerns, and only one friend who even remotely believed I was depressed. Plus some other stuff I wasn’t conscious of and couldn’t control.

I know at the end of the day my mental health is no one else’s responsibility and it’s up to me to seek help and treatment - which I did - I was the first person to think to go to the hospital initially even though I was skeptical. But I’d ideally just like a friend or family I’m close with who I can talk to about this stuff on occasion. But I guess you can’t always depend on that. Strangers on the internet sometimes will - but it’s still nice to have someone you’re already close with be supportive of you. 

For anyone who wants to say - you should just break up with your boyfriend. Let me just tell you that’s not the first option. We’ve been together for more than 10 years, living together for most of that time, and are common law which is legally the same as married in my country (i.e. may need lawyers to help split). Plus i know for a fact because of this pandemic and loss of hours at work - he can’t afford to live on his own. For me, I could move in with my parents - but they’re sometimes very abusive and it could be an even worse situation for me to be in. 

Anyway rant over. Sorry that was so long. __tl;dr__ just read the title lol. Thanks for listening."

hako4o,SuicideWatch,I'm a waste,"Tonight I was going to do it. In my parents' home. I was going to lay on my bed and bleed out from my wrists and die. 

My mom walked in when I was just lightly scraping my skin to mark where I'd cut later tonight. She said ""I just wanted to see you."" I had to hide my body under the covers so that I could keep her from seeing what I had done to my arm and my body at that point. She came in and laid down on my bed and rest her head on my lap. ""It's comfortable,"" she said. I tried my best to hold back tears. 

She eventually left and now I'm here, staring at my razorblade, wondering why I'm left here as a sympathetic, pitiful loser. All I can imagine is my mom opening the door to my childhood bedroom and seeing my blood-stained mattress with a lifeless sack of organs on top. I can imagine her crying. 

I feel like a waste of money and time. The thousands of dollars that have been pumped into me for the promise of a successful future is too much. The time that people have invested in me for relationships and friendships is too much time that would've been better spent anywhere else. The only time I enjoy is time wasted on videogames and music. I am less than mediocre at both. 

My whole life has been infested with lies and attention whoring. I've lied about my age online so that guys wouldn't be afraid to talk to me. I've created a whole new person that interacts with me and my friend group online just so I can make my other friends jealous. I lie to my friends to manipulate them into doing what I want them to do. As for the attention whoring, I've done enough of it in my early teens. At 14, I was telling men online that I was 18. Id send them pictures of myself so that I could get validation. I craved the romantic attention that I never got at that age.

It's now 12am and I'm still here, scoring my thighs and spitting on the wounds. I've taken breaks while typing this and I feel like I'm ready. I just need some validation that I'm not the only one that knows that their life is completely fucked from decisions made by themselves. 

So. Speaking of decisions that I made that fucked up my life.
I'm living with 43° scoliosis that gives me severe backpain that (shocker) I have given to myself. I, as the attention whore I was in elementary school, longed for something that would make me different from the other kids at school. I sat in weird postures and slept in strange positions until my spine decided to follow through with my plan. The next scoliosis check that I had, I was told to get checked for scoliosis. Lo and behold, now I'm at a 43° curve that requires a long and painful surgery to fix. 
I also fucked with my eyesight as a child so that I could get glasses. Now I'm stuck with 7mm thick lenses in my glasses that signify that I'm legally blind to anyone that even sees my glasses. 
I AGAIN fucked up my life when I decided to go along with my parents' narrative and pretend to be Christian. Now I've been working at my church for 6 years. I've also been attending and tithing every week. I'm in the worship band and am currently planning a summer retreat. After 14 years of church, I still don't know what the fuck is going on.

I'm tired of being the second child that is happy and creative and spontaneous and yay!!!!

I'm tired of asking for help and never getting any

I'm tired of lying to people

I'm tired of being a waste of time and money

I'm tired of being completely mediocre

I'm so tired 

It is now 1am and I'm going to do it in 3 hours. 

time to write an unorganized essay for a suicide note.

would it be funny if i wrote it like how highschoolers write their essays? idk

thanks for reading my rambling and my unorganized baby-babble

edit: haha im still here. im still here. im still here.

i spent all night last night trying to write a suicide note, trying to justify myself, trying to excuse myself from living. i wrote a crude one and posted it here before i started the one i meant for my parents and friends. i got three pages in and i fell asleep from exhausting myself mentally and physically. a dark, dreamless sleep that has left me contemplating this morning. i look down at my thighs and my wrists and wonder if dying is really what i want. i read the beginning of my note and pity the author. my sheets are bloody from my thighs and i know my mom can already only handle the smallest bit of blood before going queasy. 

am i going insane? i cant follow through on anything, and now i cant follow through on my own suicide attempt. i had it all planned out and scheduled so that i could finally have something that i scheduled correctly. now im 5 hours late to my own death.

i read the comments in this post and I've spent the past 5 minutes trying to figure out a way to tell you I'm still here. i cant tell if what you all have said is something i should be grateful for or if i should despise you. i guess my answer will come in time. 

in the meantime, im still here and I still feel like shit. i felt like this kind of update is needed to this type of situation."

I start counselling soon and I'm going to make a big effort to try and turn my life around. I've spent long enough being miserable and I deserve to be happy. I hope on my next birthday I look back on this day proud of how far I've come. I hope that this is the last Birthday where I feel sad."

8b4hnr,SuicideWatch,I wish I could give my life to someone who wants to live,"Sometimes, I wish I could trade places with a terminal cancer patient who is holding onto life as tightly as he can. I do not have any enthusiasm for life, and it seems like a waste. I feel like I am going through the motions, just waiting to die... and it's going to be a long wait. I have been in therapy for 10 years, and it's constantly like this. I wish euthanasia for mental illness were a thing.

See, there is nothing in this world that brings me joy. I do not have any hobbies, and I do not have a job. I am going to be evicted if I do not find something before May, and while I have been applying, I also don't see the point. I have this black-and-white image in my head-- like a flipbook-- of me going through the motions until I am older enough to retire. I think I would rather cut to the chase because being alive hurts. There mornings where I wake up and take a handful of sleeping pills to make myself fall asleep again. That's really what I am doing... I am waiting to die.

It kind of feels good to type this out. I have not been out of my apartment for almost two weeks. It's almost like I've forgotten what the sound of my own voice sounds like. My boyfriend recently moved away, and we hardly talk anymore. My therapist dumped me (it's a long story + it was kinda my fault, so dont blame her), so I am without support (or structure). I do not have any friends. My family thinks I am being a drama queen and won't ""play"" this game with me anymore. If I were to kill myself tonight, I wonder how long it would take the world to notice. I imagine it would take a while unless my decomposing body starts to smell and a neighbor complains.

I have prescriptions for a whole cocktail of drugs, but I am not 100% certain that an overdose would be successful. I'm 80% sure since I have stimulants and relaxants and sedatives and with some alcohol-- I don't drink, so I image I don't have a lot of tolerance-- it almost feels like I can pull it off. My biggest fear is failing. I am afraid I will only have a seizure and then have to deal with the aftermath of my suicide attempt. God, I don't want to spend more time in a psych ward.

I will use this to my advantage to finally end my own life. Once I am alone in my apartment, with no one to stop me or witness me, I will overdose on all my medication pills at the same time. Then, I will die and finally know peace. Maybe then my parents will know peace too."

e0h3wr,SuicideWatch,This will get lost in a sea of Suicide notes,"I’m using this to say exactly how I feel cause I know no one will see this. 

The last time I was genuinely happy was when I was 5.. then my grandfather died. I was extremely close to him and after his death things just weren’t the same, fast forward to 7th grade my father whom I was never close to despite living in the same house decided to slowly leave his family for another family and left my mom and I alone, then my mother took him back which kissed me off and caused me to an angry child who didn’t trust anyone... which probably caused me to never have a real relationship cause I never feel good enough and I can never fully trust them. Anyways I was always socially awkward/ shy and didn’t have a lot of friends but I have 3 childhood best friends I can at least say I have but as we’ve gotten older and everyone is moving on with their lives I feel stuck. 

My life began to really fall apart in the fall of 2017 ( my second year of college) when I began to rapidly lose the vision in my left eye due to a condition I have that I didn’t even know about until the year before but the doctors said I shouldn’t worry to much about it, due to the loss of my vision in that eye I had 2 eye surgeries to try and repair it but they didn’t work which shocked the doctors. I took a semester off of school to recover and came back in hopes to finish school, then in February of this year the vision in my right eye began to slowly go away. I had to quit my job and leave school and move back in with my parents to try to “ heal”..

I eventually got a job ( which I hate with a passion) and became stuck... then I got into a car accident and totaled my car so now I’m carless. I want to go back to school and get a new car but I feel like what’s the point if I won’t be able to see in a few months, everyday when I wake up before I open my eyes I think “ am I going to be able to even see”. It sucks because surgery won’t work, I’ve tried the holistic approach too and I’m still just slowly losing my sight. I really took things like that for granted.  My parents put me in therapy and it has caused me to face things but with my looking at the bigger picture I’m like what’s really the point? 


I’ll have 3 days of me feeling like myself and”happy” then it’ll be weeks of me in a deep depression wanting to kill my self or hoping I’ll die. I told my mother I want to kill myself before I go completely blind because I couldn’t live like that ( respect to those that are blind and live cause y’all are strong.. even though y’all can’t see this) so I said I’m going to see how the rest of the year plays out cause I’m not going into 2020 like this, but it’s like when I try to get my shit together nothing goes right, I had my heart set out for this new job and everyone there was like you got the job, the supervisors liked you, the employees recommended you, etc... no call back ( I was supposed to get one yesterday if I got the job) that was my breaking point. 

That job really was a push for me to keep going but now that I didn’t get it I feel stuck again, I feel like I sound stupid and dramatic and I know this is worded horribly but I guess I’m just writing my jumbled thoughts out. I’ve been looking up easy ways to kill myself but I’ve seen that there are none... if I had a gun I’d just shoot myself, I looked up ODing on pills but it’s hit or miss and the miss will fuck you up, I thought about hanging myself but I’m black and I’d feel weird idk lol, I think about driving into oncoming traffic and hoping I’ll die but I don’t want to total my dads car cause that’s his property, I thought about cutting myself but I’ve read that that’s a slow death. 

It’s like why is it so hard to die when you want to but when life is going good then you get sick, or die, etc. I guess I sound like a bitch cause I want to die but I don’t want to feel any pain but I guess I’ll have to feel pain in the process cause afterwards they’ll be no more pain. There’s like so much going on in my head and so much to write but idek what to say tbh even though I already said a lot, all in all I’m just so tired. Tired of crying myself to sleep, crying to work, crying at work, crying alone at home, and crying myself to sleep. I’ve been trying to disconnect myself from people but it’s like I still crave human interaction that’s why I feel like a fraud cause I want to be alone but I don’t to feel alone. 

This whole thing probably doesn’t even make any sense but I’m just writing out my thoughts. No one will see this anyways or even read all of this anyways. At first I was giving myself till the end of the year but now I’m just trying to find the best method to end it."
ca0ydf,SuicideWatch,Hi i went from 100% certain i want to kill myself to not knowing what to do... I guess its an improvement? Thanks ya all that helped i would be dead by now if it wasn't for you all... Im looking forward to seeing what the future will bring... Cheers on ya all!!🥰,

She is amazing and beutiful yet i cant stop looking at other girls and wishing they were intrested in me. Im stressed as fuck from school and it all doesnt seem worth.

f95k41,SuicideWatch,It's 11:40 and I'm gonna kill myself at midnight.,"Not here to be talked out of it, just wanted to say something anonymously I guess. I just got dealt a shitty hand in life in a lot of ways. Sure not as shitty as some others have it, but it's all shitty. I was never meant to find someone to be happy with or anything like that, I was always meant to die alone. I tried to avoid it but by 30 it became clear the path I was going down.

More importantly, I just never was happy with myself or life in general. Losing loved ones, losing touch with friends and never making new ones, being bored with the work I chose but having no interest in going back to school. Life is just not worth it to me. Lots of suffering and sadness with not much upside. I said if I wasn't feeling better by 31 I'd end it, and here I am. I'll miss my family but I'm done ""being strong for others."" Time to take care of myself.

I chose a method that is very lethal and should go quick. Yeah I know ""you might screw up"" but oh well, that's a risk I'll take. Oh and I'm sure someone will show up to tell me I'll go to hell like they always do to people here, and yeah, I'm shaking in my boots ;) lol.

Holy shit, 15 minutes now as I write this. I'm scared obviously but also excited. It'll finally be done.

Good luck everyone no matter your situation, if you choose to keep going I hope you end up better than I did. Bye."

I know there will be no relief for the pain I feel every god damn day. I’m jealous of everyone who is content living like a damn robot slaved to society doing the exact same thing everyday.

Now I have this whole English research paper to write on some bullshit topic I chose and we have to “collaborate” and “brainstorm” in class with people who are writing COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PAPERS. It’s fucking stupid. They’re not sharing my grade why should I have to ask for their help?? I keep skipping class cause I don’t want to go through that bullshit even if my grade suffers.

I think I’d be happier dropping out, living with my parents, and just working two jobs so I can focus on my side hustle. It’s just hard when my parents are immigrants and they keep telling me I’m wasting the opportunity they gave me. 

I don’t know. I just know I can’t take this shit anymore."
kkcv5c,SuicideWatch,I've grown to despise life and people.,"I'm Thirty-seven. I have autism the supposed high functioning kind but that's a load of shit. There is no such thing. There's fucked and slightly less fucked.

The cherry on top? It was preventable. My 'wonderful' mother couldn't stop puffing her cancer sticks for nine months. So I get a lifetime subscription to the shit show that is my brain.

It gets better though. In gradeschool I was abused. My lovely aunt and grandmother buried it because , I don't know. Reasons. This escalated my behavioral issues in school and at home immensely. Rage doesn't even begin to describe it.

.

School was boring as hell. I had autisim I wasn't retarded. But the lovely school system couldn't tell the difference. So I was stuck in Special Ed, not being challenged at all. By all rights I should've been three grades above where I was. Public schools like uniformity. Different is anathema to them.

So my second year of middle school I said fuck it and quit going. I wasn't getting anything out of it anyway. Contrary to what most adults and parents think...you can't make a child do anything they don't want to do. They tried to make me go back. I refused. When my father hit me with the belt I called the police on him.

It was the last time that ever happened.

At fifteen or sixteen I got my highschool deploma from a by mail school. Mostly out of spite. It was a waste of time and money.

My general anexity and inability to be what society deems normal kept me from getting a job. Well almost.

I worked for the family construction business starting at age 15 to 21 where I had wrecked my back. 0/10. Would not recommend. Money was great however it destroyed my developing body. I suffer from chromic pain now. Which on good days can be described as an icepick twisting in my hip and a baseball bat smashing into my back...and on bad sees me unable to walk from my bedroom to the bathroom without suffering from muscle spasms.

I digress.

At twenty-five(I think)  I moved across the entire US to get away from them. With my then girlfriend/fiance. In retrospect it was a doomed relationship. While I cared for her my desire to get away from my family mattered more. I had grown to hate them.

I had to come home two years later due to irreconcilable differences. I left again a short time later to be with another girl. At age thirty no less. I've been with this one since. If not for the disability laws we'd be married now.

My life had finally come together. We moved back to help tend to my ailing father. Stage four cancer. It was in 'remission'. or supressed. Whatever they do to keep it undercontrol.

I was healthier. Until I was forced to deal with my toxic wastedump of a family again.

My mother hated my 'wife' and mother inlaw. She resented me for not being there to help with my father. (Yeah fuck you too bitch.) When he first took ill. Mm. She made no secret of that in how she treated me.

In the amidst of all that my grandmother, one who helped raise me...and also swept the abuse under the rug. Died.

When I finally confronted my mother and aunt...my aunt claimed no such thing ever happened to me. So the options are casual indifference or malicious stupidity. The rage I had came back two fold.

Luckily I lived across town. I could be there for my dad...help get him to this appointments and visit...yet I was isolated enough that I didn't have to deal with the excess family shit I tried to escape.

Until 2020.

In this godawful hellscape of a year... I lost my uncle in july. He was one of two male rolemodels I had. He helped instill morals in me and helped raise me.

I lost my house(A rental), because the phrase 'caregiver' went in one ear and out the other. My priority was my dad. So sometimes the lawn wouldn't be cut as often as they would like. Or sometimes the house wouldn't be as clean. Sorry I have priorities. The shitbag landlord told us the neighborhood was becoming gentrified and he wouldn't be renewing our lease at the end of the year.

So unpleasantly I had to move back home with my wife and mother in law. Where my mother finds fault in everything.

Lovely.

A month after I move in my father dies.

Its at this juncture I begin to despise pretty much everyone and everything. I could not, in my wildest dreams imagine life being this goddamned cruel. I thought I'd get another year with him. Instead I got a middle finger.

A week or so before his birthday.

Then the petty fights started over bullshit. They are too numerous to even bother recounting here. Everyday some minor drama.

As if that wasn't enough... One of the kittens I hand raised and tamed had to be put to sleep due to cancer. After I spent 350 dollars I didn't fucking have to try and save her life. It wasn't my cat though. It was my dads. So another kick in the nuts.

This has been my life for the last three months. One blow after another with selfish ignorant people who continue to be absolute douchebags. Fighting over inconsequential shit that no sane person would give a damn about.

The cat dying was the last straw for me. I went off my meds. I was tried of playing peace keeper or being 'the man of the house.'

If I'm going to be miserable, I'm going to be miserable. I'm not going to keep pumping chemical bullshit into me to give me an artificial happy only to have it destroyed by selfish ignorant fucks.

TO make matters worse, the constant snark directed at my wife has her in such a state she doesn't want to do anything. So cleaning, the litterboxes all of it falls on me now. This enviroment is destroying  the one healthy relationship I have. I'm growing to hate her too.

Oh did I mention I'm a firearm owner? I had to stay away from them for years until I trusted myself enough to use them responsibly again. The entire experience has destroyed that. I can't even enjoy one of the few hobbies my dad and I shared.

Years of healing unraveled in a few short months.

I'm a prisoner inside my own mind(And home it feels like)  half the time and the other half Well....I'm getting yelled at for leaving to go buy mcdonals at 11 at night or treated like I'm still a child because apperently I'm supposed to ask permission before leaving.. HAHAHA No.

I've just about had my fill of other peoples bullshit. Though don't mistake me. I'm far too spiteful to actively harm anyone but myself. See if I opt out of this, the people who did nothing but make me miserable will have the guilt of my suicide on their minds. That thought alone makes me smile.

I find myself looking at my dad's 1911 which I carry everyday...wondering why I don't stick the thing in my mouth and pull the trigger.

Even at my lowest I used to have reasons why I wouldn't. Now the reasons why I should vastly out weigh the reasons why I shouldn't.

Now that I have the text here, looking at it... I suppose the only reason I haven't is I'm not convinced the damn thing would actually kill me. The way this shitfuck of a year has gone I'd survive and be wheelchair bound or more mentally damaged than I already am.  There's always the shotgun I suppose...but it doesn't have the same sense of poetic irony to it.

So yeah. Merry Christmas to me.

f0gt3e,SuicideWatch,I am ending my life tonight,"Tonight, I’m finally ending it all after 21 years of living.  I was neglected by my mother when I was an infant, her neglect and inattentiveness led to me being sexually abused by my caretaker. This has led to many psychological problems such as PTSD, depression, anxiety, OCD and borderline personality disorder. I have wanted to die since I was 6 years old. I see no hope in living anymore. 

I ruin all my relationships. The love of my life broke up with me a month ago. In a state of despair, I hooked up with random men to fill the void. My ex said he would never get back together with me if I slept with other people. I see no point in living. I’m an abusive pile of shit who isn’t capable of being loved because I hurt the people I love most. I have been in therapy for years and I continue to be a fucking monster. 

I ordered refills for medication I have been hoarding. Tonight, I’m going to drive to a place that was special to my ex and I. I am going to end it all tonight.

I'm done being held hostage by my father, everything about my life controlled like I'm a prisoner. I'm done hearing how gay people deserve to be genocided. I'm done hearing how women deserve to be raped and confined in chains. I'm done being told to do impossible things like rip off the government(?? how) to bring money into a house, money that is supposed to go to a new house but instead gets spent for weed. I'm done hearing him degrade my mother and her just taking it. I'm done with my fucking low-functioning sociopathic half-brother who sets my father off and makes him abuse the rest of us once he loses it, including my poor dog. And of course, my brother gets anything he needs anyways, because he's male and worth more than me.

I've never worked. Never had a boyfriend in real life. Never had a real life friend since I was 11. I graduated high school online a year late with a GPA of 1.7 because he wouldn't let me study. I hurt or ghost everyone I get close to online because he cuts the internet and changes passwords every other day to keep me off so what's the point.

I need to get out. It's either I get out, soon, or I kill myself and hopefully take him with me beforehand, whether it be today or next week or next month. It's been looming for a while now, the urge. The only reason I haven't yet is because I didn't know how until recently, my life is THAT FUCKING CONTROLLED that I couldn't even kill myself. Hell, the fucking kitchen knives are so dull they can't even cut bread, let alone an artery. But I know how now. It came to me tonight, as he rages and calls people like me sick things that deserve to die and throws things and threatens to cut peoples throats. I have the resolve, I have the means. It doesn't even hurt to say it now. In fact, this is the first time I haven't cried all night, because I've accepted it.

I can't drive. No ID or money for a bus. I don't even know where my social security number is. There's no women's shelter, or any shelter, in this piece of shit town he confines us in. Hell, I probably wouldn't make it if there was, I'd be raped or abducted into human trafficking before I got there, that's the kind of place it is. I can't even call the police, no phone and they're known for being wifebeaters and raping girls up on the reservation anyways, they don't care about one girl.

Please, if anyone knows an out. I don't even want to post here, it's probably not the right place, I feel like a lost cause anyways. But I'm trying. I'm trying so fucking hard to hold on. 22 years is a long time to hold on. I'm so tired.

bieioq,SuicideWatch,"Does anyone else feel like they have to commit suicide to get revenge on the people that hurt me, to tell the world I am not gonna put up with its crap, and to that I have to do it to ask the world to solve the problems I am facing for others?","I have been suicidal ever since my grandparents passed away several years ago. I don't have much family, I feel like I need to kill myself to escape that pain because it can't be solved because you can't bring dead people back from the dead, and I feel like if I kill myself I can leave a note to tell the world to solve this problem for others. I am estranged from the family I do have and I feel like I need to kill myself to let them know they have hurt me. I hate how I don't have a big family, lots of friends, don't have a good job or are rich, and don't get to go on vacations. People disrespect me. I feel like if I kill myself I can tell the world that I am not gonna put up with its unfairness. 

Would me commuting suicide and writing a detailed note change the world? 

I hate how people think of mental health issues when they think of suicide when they don't think of lonliness or lack of family casting it. 

I know some peopme say that family doesn't have to be blood but someone will always tell me when I say that ""blood is thicker than water"". Maybe this will tell the people that say that I won't put up with that bullcrap."

gxn9me,SuicideWatch,"Sleeping and dreaming is the only enjoyment I get daily, anymore","Each day I wake up as I near closer to 24, I feel as though little has been felt to be accomplished by myself in my wandering through every new week. 

It’s all too much anymore to accept that my life has led me to where I am now— to simply accept that all of my successes and failures have ultimately left me lost in myself. I have no direction. I have no college education, my job prospects are slim with each one feeling terribly meaningless, giving no joy or sense of accomplishment for having attempted or even succeeded, at times to perform adequately.

I have a relationship, I suppose I am better for it, but each day I wake up, I feel as though every moment I try to engage with my partner, I bring him down in my depression. It seems only too much, the burden of my love; I feel I’m just too heavy a weight on those around me. 

I have lost all of my money and savings attempting to regain a sense of control over my life by spending money on groceries, simple things like helping around the house. 

Perhaps my issue is my mental illness I have yet to be diagnosed with, but my therapist seems to not care about any diagnoses of the sort. 

The crushing debt of sadness I get every day from waking up and not being in the dreams that made me feel purposeful and free from life and worries of financial struggle have left me feeling as though any happiness I can achieve is simply that— a dream.

It is selfish, but I lose my will to live more and more; I care little about actually dying, it seems the only person I am afraid to hurt is my beloved, but I fear I can’t stay suffering like this much longer, worrying about money, my worth, the pain of simply living. It has been months coming that I have been wasting away.

 Exercise only distracts my heart when I have someone with me, and the enjoyment fades all too quickly as soon as it begins, so much so before we finish the outing.

Calling some hotline has only left me feeling worse afterwards, but I try my best to hang on, if only out of love for my fiancé.

I feel as though my place in the world should have been found by now, I am still young, but why does my zeal for life flicker like a candle to the wind? I can’t enlighten myself to give much more, I feel. 
I feel the time is coming for my life to end by my own hand, as I can’t reckon enough willpower to handle the listlessness and longing for joy to come back. 

I don’t know when I will do it, but I try to encourage myself to make it to the end of the year, but I sense as though I may not make it to the end of this month."

One the one hand I cannot destroy the lives of my parents and affect my friends in such a tragic way on the other hand I hate existing, what should I do?"
cpy5ew,SuicideWatch,"""it will get better"" being the biggest lie ive been told. I desire suicide.","I currently suffer from Borderline Personality Disorder, clinical depression and general anxiety, and would rather abuse alcohol than take antidepressants, which I believe wouldn't help my already 'too far gone' mindset. 
I'm crushed under the weight of the simplest of daily tasks, getting out of bed in the late hours of the day and walking around tiredly with no motivation to get things done no matter how long I've slept, struggling to shower and get myself clean, suffering from loss of appetite some days to completely over indulging other days, or even just sitting up in my bed. 
I lay there for hours upon waking up, lightheaded from crying for hours in the early hours of the morning until I feel sick, staring blankly at my TV which is almost never turned off. 
I never leave my room. I store bottles of water and food by my bed so I can interact with my housemates as little as possible and drink heavily most nights and pass out drunk after hours of Xbox and minor interaction with the outside world.
I hardly have the stomach to face my housemates, ignore every phone call, mute every messaging service I use and reply to people weeks later only to find they have lost interest in staying in contact with me and decide to distance themselves before I would be able to push them away with made up situations I create with them in fear of abandonment. I fear rejection. I push people away before they get the chance to do so to me so I can say I wasn't the one who fucked up even though cutting the ones I love out for no proper reason is the very definition of ""fucked up"".
What surprises people the most is the fact that I am well aware that I have friends.
I am well aware that I have people in my life who love me and care about me so much that they want to support me and see me recover and do something productive with my life.
I am well aware that I need help. 
I am not in denial. 
But I'm made to believe I'm a selfish wreck for wanting to die.
I'm made to believe I'm a dumbass for not getting help, all the offers of support and ignoring them so I look fucking stupid despite telling people I just..can't. I don't have the energy anymore. Like, I just can't.
I had goals in life. I dreamt of a sober, healthy lifestyle surrounded by my closest friends and a loving relationship, not being unemployed and relying on benefits because I'm simply too damaged to work a proper job. Just being happy.
Unfortunately, a life like this is almost impossible for the mentally unwell. Knowing you'll have these illnesses for the rest of your life, risking your relationships with your friends and family, your significant other, and the risk of diving so low that you lose your job and end up in the dirt with nothing left or a substance addiction.
I couldn't tell you what's worse.
So far, I found someone I wanted a long lasting relationship with, we love each other and put up with the rough edges we constantly face because of my mental breakdowns and BPD making me believe he was my partner only to make me feel better about myself and that he never truly loved me and that destroyed so much. He faced paragraphs of my insecurities and self loathing, the validation seeking, the questions about whether he even really loved me and it fucked everything up. We had a 6 month break and things returned to the way they were, but once again I destroyed everything because of the shitty made up situations I made up in my head. I'm deeply in love with this person and I struggle to see it work out anymore unless I fix myself but I'm beyond help and don't know how I would even fix myself at this point. 
I have given up. 
I am tired. 
I wanted to fix myself to prove to him that I could be the best person I could possibly be, love him the way he deserves to be loved, and prove to him just how sorry I am for the drama and hurt I caused him. The verbal abuse, the drunken abuse. I look back at the things I did and I just struggle to live a day to day life knowing I caused so much hurt to the person I've loved so deeply since I met him. The person I would give so much for, to bend over backwards just to see him smile. All I think about is the memories we made together and it aches me that I'll probably never experience these things with him again because I'm so broken. Friendship with this person is hard, and I'm deeply saddened that I can't tell him just how I feel. It has driven me to believing I'd be better off dead so I can't hurt him anymore.
I also wanted to fix myself for my family. My friends. 
For myself. Things could be so good right now if I wasn't such a horrible person, so far all I've ever done is created problems for everyone that I've ever loved/everyone that's ever loved me and I can't stand this life anymore. I'm so fucking sad and I'm sick of hurting everyone I love. 
I am unlovable and don't deserve friends. 
This may be it for me, Reddit, this is the tip of the iceberg but the internet cares little for a complete strangers life troubles. 
I have a strong desire for suicide right now, and believe this is the gateway to solving my problems. 
I don't think anything could save me now. 

Mum would be devastated, and who knows if anyone in my circle of friends would care, and I love my mother but I am in pain."

afo6tb,SuicideWatch,My boyfriend comes from 3 generations of suicide. He took his life in November 2017. I am really fucking depressed. We have a 7 year old daughter. I feel ill every moment of every day.,"He was my best friend. I have constant nightmares. We struggled so much after his death - I got my daughter involved with a grief center for children in our town. I battled with her school because she got called to the principle’s office and was reprimanded to saying out loud to another student that she was sad at Christmas because she missed her Daddy. That student told their parents and those parents called the school and complained about my daughter upsetting their daughter...She has lots of friends with westerly families and gossipy moms. The rumor went around that her Dad died from a drug overdose (he hung himself) and no one wanted to have play dates anymore or associate with us. 

I worked so hard and advocated for my daughter the best I could. I found every resource possible for her. But I didn’t take any time for myself I guess. My family was very difficult to deal with regarding his death - my mom was extremely against my daughter even being at her Dad’s funeral - it took her counselor from school to tell my mom how important closure would be for my daughter. My mom does not know how to regulate her thoughts or feelings. She also doesn’t want my daughter to have any connection or relationship with her Dad’s side of her family. She got upset and scared that my daughter would choose her Dad’s family over her, which is ridiculous. After her Dad’s death, I brought my daughter to her Dad’s family, across country. My mom flipped out and called child protective services on me. She can’t handle not having control over my daughter.

So I’ve been battling with Child Protective. My mom filed for custody of my daughter. There have been a bunch of recent child deaths in my state and the attention is on DHS and they aren’t fucking around with anything. So even though I’m an amazing mother, have done everything possible to help my daughter with her grief - I’ve now had my role as a parent ripped from me. If you thought those upity moms judged us then, you should see how they judge us now.

I’m done with it all. My daughter is now a stranger to me. It’s been 7 months without her and I really have no purpose in life anymore. I mean, I know my worth but being involved with the State and system rips your entire soul up. 

I have no fucking purpose to live. I understand why her Dad left. I want to leave also. "
fn31cw,SuicideWatch,I'm this fucking close to ending it. [17M] Really Really Really Long. Sorry. Might be graphic. Might get offended. Discretion advised. IDK.,"First of all, I don't know if I need or even want help. Maybe I just want some anonymous people sitting behind computer screens to sympathize with me. I honestly don't know what I'm doing right now other than venting. My ""life story"" might come out as very very long but its the only way I can express and explain what I'm going through right now. I can't just do a tl;dr for this.

Just to make things clear: My father is an abusive, manipulative, psychopathic, wife-beater, piece of shit. I was/am not abused with the sack of shit, but my mother has been physically, mentally, emotionally, and financially abused.

Here we go (Some parts obscured):

I was born to international parents, as in they are both different nationalities. Upper middle class to lower upper class. NOT ""rich"" because my father doesn't understand how credit cards, loans, mortgages or saving money works. I've moved plenty of times more than I count on my two hands, living in 4 different countries including birth country. I will refer to them as country 1, 2, 3, 4, in order of moving.

I lived in my birth country(1) for about the first half of my life and was the only time period where I genuinely could smile and have fun. I would have play dates with kids who were born at the same hospital(fairly small town), we were all friends even when we grew up and started to go to school. We would have birthday parties at the local laser tag arena, we were in the same drama/theater class (yeah I know), we would go camping together in when we were in boy scouts. We went to the same schools, same sports clubs, same nearly everything. It was the only time where I would wake up in the morning and look forward to the day, and sleep at night without worrying about anything. I didn't notice any abuse at that time until the last few years when I would start to comprehend why my mother was screaming and crying behind a closed door while I tired to sleep at night. Now that I think about it, the majority of my memories from my childhood are those of my mother crying and hurting from the beatings my father gave her. Even if I try to remember the fun times I had with forgotten names and faces, it all gets overwritten by the horrors I witnessed.

My father was somewhat lucky enough to get transferred to country 2 which just so happened to be the birth country of my mother. Despite the sudden transfer, my mother and I agreed to go because my grandparents were there, and just a couple of hours away. My father had to work immediately and so he went a couple months before us because we had to wait for the moving company to arrive and take everything and send it overseas. My mother and I were excited at first because we were going to my mothers homeland, but that excitement faded when we got to the airport. My asshole of a father didn't even show up at the airport leaving a mother and a 9 year old child with a couple suitcases and a box at arrivals because my mother spoke the local language. We managed to get a taxi and got to our apartment building but couldn't get in because we didn't have the security key. The clerk at the front desk were kind enough to let us in and all the way up to the apartment(27th floor). That alone just shows the attitude my father had back then. Since I could somewhat speak and understand the local language, my mother wanted me to go to a local school so I could hone on my language skills, but the school choice was unlucky. The majority of the students there were nice, but the teachers and administration were utter shit. They were plenty of ""fights"" everyday mostly disrupting the class and the administrators couldn't give a shit to actually punish the students enough. I have to admit that I was in some of them as well, nothing too serious, but enough to get me in ""trouble"" as well. A bunch of parents couldn't take it anymore and decided to sue the school or something and well my mother pulled me from the school after one and a half years or so going there. It was a real shame because I actually quite liked my classmates there, excluding the ones that thought it would be funny to fuck with me, but still. After that disaster of a school my mother transferred me into an international school which was okay but I got into a lot of shit for not doing homework and the usual stuff. I made some friends who had mutual interests in some phone games and sports, and since the student population was so small I was friendly with mostly everyone. However, I was already becoming shy and shutting people out of personal things at that point (gets important later). It was at this time when I had actual thoughts of suicide. My friends and I started to get into rooftopping(climbing onto roofs of skyscrapers or just any building, taking pictures etc) and unlike the others, I liked it because of the thrill of one wrong step and death awaits hundreds of feet below. The thrill eventually gave me a sort of high that if I walked of the ledge, I wouldn't have to be burdened by keeping the fact that my father abuses my mother from the world and the only pain I would feel was when I hit the ground hard. Unbeknownst to my friends, I would regularly go solo and just contemplate on the ledges of buildings whether to jump or not, but I never could because I couldn't leave my mother to that scumbag.

Oh did I tell you what my father was doing during this time? After the first couple of weeks of being in country 2, my mother and father got into an argument and then my father just poofed. For 3 years. He would occasionally, emphasis on occasionally, leave cash in an envelope in the mailbox which I guess was ""living expenses"" because my mother didn't work, and my father doesn't understand that you have to pay back your credit card expenses. I never knew about any mental conditions(legit depression) my mother has/had until recently but my mother and I would sometimes go to a therapist, where all I did was play games but my mother would come out teary eyed. I had no clue at the time, but I always regret not knowing sooner.

After a few years in country 2, my father got transferred to country 3 which I wasn't as excited about because then I would be living with the cunt again and dealing with the 24/7 fear of hearing my mother being beat and not being able to prevent it. We got there about when I was around 12, I don't remember completely but by then I was completely shut in and didn't let anyone come near me save a couple of kids who lived in the neighborhood. I was the new kid with a funny/cool accent and was bombarded with questions and stares every time I opened my mouth and had to explain I was born in country 1 and so on. This added to my already shy demeanor because I didn't want people to know my  mother was being beat by my father. I never went emo or goth or that one depressed kid sitting at the back of the room. Never hung out with the wrong crowd. Never did alcohol or drugs. Never got into fights. Hell I barely even talked. Answered questions when only needed. Didn't show any emotions unless absolutely necessary, and that changed me. I started doing things and feeling things of which a sociopath would do(Correct me if I'm wrong I'm not a doctor). I would lie to people to get them to do what I want, i.e. snitch on each other, get people to fight, get out of trouble myself, get better grades in some classes. I even did a bit of blackmailing to both students and teachers. I couldn't care less what happened to other people because the majority of the people at that school only saw me as the quiet kid who has a foreign accent when he rarely talks. I eventually stopped blackmailing at least because the stuff I had wasn't really useful since the worst thing that could happen to the victims were probably a suspension and a warning. I also did a bit of shoplifting and pick pocketing which gave me a thrill due to the absence of buildings higher than the third story where I was at. During my 4 or 5 years of being in country 3, my father would beat my mother so many times I started to have anxiety attacks in the middle of the night and I would barely get any sleep from fear. My heart rate would go up and I would be pumped with adrenaline every time someone raises their voice because I got so used to stepping in and fighting my father when he would try to hurt my mother. My fathers beatings on my mother started to decline whenever I was around because I've put him in a couple of headlocks to subdue him(I can't use my fists or whatever because he looks like an obese pregnant lady, fat absorbs punches \[no offense to overweight people\] and I'm not a fan of breaking my knuckles on a face I'd rather break a bat on a skull).

Now onto recent events, my father transferred again to country 4 where we currently reside in. He actually got here about a year ago, whereas me and my mother only got here about a two months ago just before COVID-19 got big. The reason why my mother and I got here a year late because there were ""problems with immigration"" most likely my father just delaying us coming here because he's a dick. We had to stay with my mothers parents for literally a year which made me miss about 2 years of schooling(I left half way through in Country 3 and different curriculum different term/semester dates messed things up).

I was super depressed and pissed at my father for from my point of view was delaying our travel and immigration to Country 4. I started some online courses to get extra credits just to put on record but got too depressed for that and I am still trying to finish it even though it should have been done before 2020. I started to become a NEET(The japan definition i.e. shut-in). All I would do is watch netflix and youtube, play some games on steam(I'm not a big gamer guy), sleep and eat during the day, and then sneak out at midnight and drink, smoke(cigarettes), hang out with some sketchy guys, ride motorbikes till sunrise, and repeat. I regularly shoplifted and watched a bunch of people get mugged by the group I was with. I didn't do it because I didn't want to get caught with assault but still guilty in most peoples eyes. I cut ties with them after I got back into rooftopping and consequently suicidal again. I know what they and I did were lawfully and morally ""wrong"" but they did distract me from wanting to kill myself. Either way, I found myself sneaking in and climbing skyscrapers again and contemplating whether or not to jump. One time a social worker/volunteer was ""patrolling"" the rooftop I was on (apparently it was ""popular"") and was trying to talk to me out of not jumping and whatnot. What she said actually helped calmed me down somewhat despite what some people think of as ""help""; my death would just be another number in a news story, what about your loved ones, what other paths could you take, that sort of thing. After that encounter I stopped climbing rooftops just to see if it would help how I feel, but it didn't really change anything except that it deprived me of a way to kill myself, I don't want to die painfully. Before I could do anything though, my mother and I were finally able to move to country 4.

That brings us here less than 2 months before me writing this post. As usual all I did was do a bit of online courses, watch some netflix and youtube, play steam games until my laptop starts heating like an oven, eat when I feel like it, sleep when I feel like it, cry a ton, contemplate jumping from my bedroom window in our apartment, then deciding not to because I don't want to die in this country. Then rinse and repeat. Since I was home all day, I only had to worry about my father getting all shouty and violent on weekends because the cunt gets too ""tired"" from work and just sleeps his ass off like the pig he is. Since he knows I can beat his ass easily, he has refrained from getting violent apart from one time where I quickly put him down with some elbows to the head(I had watched some UFC illegal moves compilation). Everything was ""fine"" up until COVID-19 started to hit hard and became a global pandemic. My father is a manager of sorts, so he is now working from home 24/7 and so my anxiety attacks are coming back and fear for my mothers safety is at an all-time high. Today was one of those days where my mother and father got into an argument where I just couldn't stand it anymore with my father berating my mother about being abusive and manipulative when she is the one with bruises and scars from his beating. I nearly fully snapped but I started putting him in a headchoke and punching him and all that and got so close to wanting to shove a knife in his throat but I had hesitated because I didn't want to leave my mother stranded in a foreign country with a dead sack of shit and a kid trying to flee the country. I know I'm smart(arrogant but somewhat true) so I laid off and am now writing this post.

As you could probably tell, the reason why I haven't killed myself or the wife-beating piece-of-shit yet is because of my mother. I love her to death and wouldn't want her to be devastated by my death and be at the mercy of father, or have to deal with a murdering son who's wanted by the cops. I also know that despite the piece-of-shit being a piece-of-shit, he's willing to pay the $55000 \~ 70000(USD) of schooling for 2 years of IB which I will be attending in August if the economy doesn't die and the world doesn't end by then. I know that if I work hard during those 2 years of IB, I could get into colleges and university's I would have never even thought of attending. The logic and reasoning inside me tells me to just wait it out for two years and then I'll be free to do what I want, but the emotional side of me somehow is winning me over after every struggle and fight and telling me to just end it all and not worry about anything. I'm a selfless person to the heart and will most likely always will be because of the way I have lived my life only caring about the well being of myself and my mother, but its just getting too much for me to handle. I'm so close to achieving my dreams of getting into a good college and being free so my mother can divorce his ass but I'm equally as close to just ending it all.

Like I said, I don't know if I'm here posting my whole life story for some sympathy or encouragement to keep going, or just someone to talk to. I don't know. Just want to say thank you to everyone who has put up with reading this long ass essay post. I just don't know.

EDIT: Thanks to all who read and responded. I just woke up after sleeping and crying a ton. I'm feeling a bit better and clearer now after going through the comments.

To those who might be a bit confused, I've begged to my mother to divorce his ass plenty of times. My mother just brushes me off and says she's in this for me. Despite who he really is, he is making bank, and he feels he has some sort of duty to get me through college/university(He didn't go, military and 70's). The reason why I haven't gone to any sort of authority/help yet is because I don't want to waste my mother's time enduring the past 20 or so years being with him by getting him arrested and then me not being able to become successful. Believe me, I have tried to call the cops so many times but my mother stops me every time because she is worried about my future. She wants me to get a good education, get a well-paying job, have a family, and treat them differently than the way my mother and I have been treated, and ultimately be happy. The way I see it, she has sacrificed her life and I don't want to make that sacrifice go in vain. This is the only reason why I haven't gone to authorities or done something or actually ended it yet. Sometimes I beat myself up with shame because the reason/logic side of me knows that it would be a stupid move to kill myself but sometimes everything just feels too heavy for me."
e40jii,SuicideWatch,Have you ever gotten jealous over hearing about someone's suicide?,"Now i did not personally know this guy, I left my town's school in 6th grade, and he moved to my town about a year or two after so I never went to school with him but I knew of him cause he hung out with my friends from town. Anyway, I am 24 now. A few days ago, I started seeing people posting ""RIP"" statuses on social media, and posting tributes to him with pictures and what not. Apparently, he was really depressed for awhile and finally decided he had had enough. At first I felt bad, and I still do. But then I started to feel really jealous, because since i was 12 i have been clinically depressed and have tried so, so many times in the past decade to kill myself, but it was never successful at it, and not a day has gone by that I haven't wanted to be dead. And apart of me is thinking ""it's not fair that he got to die and i'm still here"". Has anyone else ever felt like this?"

The voices came back strong. I’m starting to agree with them more and more. They’re right, he doesn’t care, no one does. There is no way to get better, no one wants to help, no one will. 

You can’t make it better, so why try. I’m not even good enough to kill myself, I can’t do anything, i just want it to take me. I give up on even trying. I’m just going to walk awayand let it take me."

ftxfg9,SuicideWatch,I lived,"I wrote a post [On March 19, 2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fl8n2m/overdosing_soon/) telling anyone who'd listen that I was going to overdose. And I did. 

But I survived, I was in ICU for a while; I had Acute Respiratory Failure With Hypoxia And Hypercapnia; Acute Metabolic Encephalopathy; Heart fucking stopped. And I was on Mechanically Assisted Ventilation via medically induced coma. *I had failed*

When Medical cleared me, I was moved over to the same hospital's psychiatric ward for 11 days. Once discharged, I was then referred to a PHP, today was my second day. 

But today, the idea that Life keeps telling me ""no"" on things I want made me start *planning* again. But not an overdose this time, something more.. permanent. But since I've been on a 5051 previously, (this time I wasn't, I was at the ward voluntary; I need help, I know that much and I'm open to getting it) that plan will be much much harder. 

Still, I am alive and I was doing really good! the meds are working, it's just that stray thought that's just started growing. But I'll bring that up tomorrow in PHP. 

Life might always say No to what I want, and Death said no to my needs.. but fuck you - I'm not saying no to getting help!

Its just a repeating cycle of hopelessness. Theres literally no chance of not struggling for my entire life and I cant keep dealing with it. I'm so tired of being happy for a day then watching as everything just falls apart around me.

edq7jz,SuicideWatch,"I have never had affection in my life, respect or trust, and I was abused and gaslit by my whole family for over 20 years. Suddenly, my brain is convinced that suicide is a realistic option?","Some backstory is needed here.

I'm a girl, in my 20s, who never had friends, and never had affection/basic respect from the whole family and people OR a normal life. Taken for granted and bullied in school.

I was physically and mentally abused mainly by my mom who doesn't like my gender.

Nearly killed by her and from the day I started noticing the gaslighting I also realised my family is made up of abusers or enablers, with people justifying my mother's insaneness even when it happened in front of them...

...telling me it was my fault and ""you are the one who drove her to kill you. You made her miserable"".

Literally the only people I can speak to is my psychologist and web friends, either because I am 100% alone and because I can't even start talking. The only times I hear my voice is during a fight with other narcs of the family.

My only way out is a job. My short term memory is mostly gone so I can't study (I tried, failed, had to leave uni) and I have no hobbies since my mind has no space for anything that isn't survival.

So here I am: familyless, friendless, without an identity, without something that makes me laugh or enjoy life, without a future that I look forward to.

In all of this, my mind is suddenly considering suicide as an OBJECTIVE solution, as the only one. I am scared of this unconsciius thought, if your situation was like mine and you got out of it, I'm listening.

Thank you in advance.

I’m nearly 25 and I still live with my parents because they are the only source of stability I have, if I move out I won’t have anybody to get up for. I won’t eat properly or go out or do anything really because I just don’t want to disappoint them anymore than I probably already have. I promised them I won’t kill myself, but after they’re gone, then what? I’ll live on my own because nobody is ever going to want me and I’m just not strong enough to do it, I can’t keep forcing myself to live if there’s nobody around for me to live for. I won’t have to worry about upsetting anybody or causing a big to do if I kill myself, so why the fuck shouldn’t I?

I regret posting this but not because of the feedback I got but because it was kind of impulsive, though I do feel authentically suicidal frequently. I feel substantially less suicidal as of right now. I’m not going to therapy yet, still not sold on that. But, for now, you’ve talked me away from following through on committing to my bday plans.

Sometimes I've gotten ""mad"" at people for acting like they don't care. Because everyone says they care but never shows it. I get mad about the fact that they pretend they care cause if they don't, they should just tell me that. Cause deep inside it's what I want. So I can prove to myself that I'm the failure I believe I am. So I can finally kill myself without the guilt. I'm very confused. Am I faking it??"

i’m scared. i know that there’s never an easy way to kill yourself, not unless your assisted but even then it’s not easy especially when it’s illegal. i think i might overdose. i’m just scared of throwing up. maybe that makes me stupid, a coward and stupidly suicidal.

i’m really done. i never realized what people meant when they talked about the mental health care system being shit, i mean, i’ve been diagnosed with severe depression, different kinds of anxieties and borderline personality disorder for the last few years (and didn’t think much of it) until i realized that how i was feeling and acting was FAR from normal so i tried to get help. why wait 3 months for another therapy appointment that never ends up helping, if i can just kill myself in those three months? there’s no point to anything anymore, i have no reason to live. besides, i’ve tried to kill myself twice already. (though, they obviously didn’t work.)

third times a charm, right?

EDIT: i wish i could say that my mental health is the only thing bringing me down. im tired of living in a world where i was sexually assaulted, i’m tired of being abused, i’m tired of having fear of seeing my father and his family. i don’t want pity, i really am just tired. i’m scared of myself and the future"

I've had 6 weeks of paid, useless therapy,  I've been on antidepressants for over a month.

Every waking moment that I'm not distracted, I think about killing myself, and apparently that's not enough to get a goddamn mental health evaluation, at the very least.

When I've referred to the crisis team in the past, they're quick to blame everything on my drug use, which is one of the few things keeping me going and I'm making the effort to cut down on. They won't even consider counselling for you if you drink often. Regardless of that, they still love passing you around, Even if I managed to get counselling, I'd have to wait until I'm back at university, since I'm only temporarily registered at my home residence. Pretty much boils down to ""not our problem.""

Everyone talks to you in the most nonchalant tone of voice, I'm aware it's for a reason, but it just adds to sense that you're nothing but a nuisance.

ddiswr,SuicideWatch,does anyone else ever felt better after writing a suicide note/planning?,"(Copied and pasted from r/depression)

I’ve had a long history of the crazies. I’ve had my ups and downs, planned suicides, not went through with it for some reason or another. But the other night I spent hours researching suicide methods (I don’t have easy access to my gun anymore, which was my main plan last year, since I’m at college) and I wrote out a note and everything, then fell asleep. The next day was the best I’d felt in months honestly. It was weird. I’d spent the whole night being the most suicidal I’ve been since before I got on antidepressants (got off them at the start of the summer...probably a bad idea but I don’t like being numb) and then the next day I was social, I talked to people, I felt actually okay. It was weird. I went back on a decline after that but it was nice feeling good again. I know it’s not normal to be writing suicide notes and planning my own demise and all that jazz, but is it weird to feel so much better after? Like I don’t know if it was just a needed release or what, because I mean I still want to kill myself, I’m not better. But I’m just curious if anyone else has ever experienced the same sort of feeling. Sorry if this is dumb. I’m tired."

gjad8l,SuicideWatch,Telling me to exercise and pick up a hobby does not make me less suicidal than I already am. Don’t feed me cliche bullshit.,"I get it. There is nothing else that anybody can say to fix your past traumas that leak into the present or your ongoing troubles. I’m just sick of being told generic bullshit. “Fall back on old hobbies”. “What are your interests?”. Does it ever occur to you that when I’m depressed and experiencing suicidal ideation, it’s because nothing sparks joy in me anymore? I no longer have a) hobbies anymore or; b) no energy to carry out those hobbies. Telling me to go for a walk is unrealistic when I’m afraid to even get out of bed in the first place and leave my room because if I do, I’m afraid of what I’m capable of doing to myself and afraid of acting on my intrusive thoughts. Why am I afraid? I don’t fear death in itself but I fear dying. The pain involved in dying. The agony. The fear of it not working. Telling me to “oh eat your favourite food”, doesn’t fucking help. I have no appetite and I unintentionally starve myself. When I try to eat the smallest amount, I can’t help but almost vomit. Time doesn’t heal all and I hate being told that it does. Shit has gotten worse over time and I’m sick of people saying you have to have patience. Says fucking who? I don’t have to do shit and even then I did for the sake of other people. Not everything is a happy ending and people need to just accept that fucking fact. We aren’t always going to get closure. Some people just are played the unfortunate cards in life and that’s how it just fucking is. Whether you admit it or not, not everybody is going to fall to some happy ending fairytale bullshit and that’s the harsh truth of reality. Don’t tell me to go outside and enjoy nature. Looking at a bunch of leaves won’t magically make me not want to kill myself and won’t cure fucking anything. I need proper help but there’s nothing out there aside from “discover your interests”. Who the fuck cares. That’s just another way of distracting yourself from the problem and running away from it, not actively sorting it out because nothing can fix it. Irreversible damage and people act like going for a run or having a warm bath will fucking change anything. Cliche as fuck. I hate this life. I wish I was dead. Nobody gives a shit until then anyway, nobody takes anyone seriously until you’re dead and even then, they forget about you within a while anyway and don’t tell me that isn’t true. They do. Because it’s human nature to be able to grieve and move on, it’s within our innate tendencies to do so. Fuck this “life”. Living and exisiting are two very different things. Living means to feel alive and I’m purely existing. “Alive” in the sense that I’m breathing but I’m dead inside. Please let me fucking go."

Nothing is helping and I don't want to live. The only reason I'm still alive is my new friends, they're my only inspiration, besides I don't give a shit, this world is full of crap.

Have kids. That has been taken away from me. I'm alone and always will be. No there is no hope, or it gets better bullshit because it doesn't.

fdlq8w,SuicideWatch,"getting bullied for painful crippling disease, going to gun stores regularly","When I was in the 10th grade I started to lose my memory and developed painful symptoms in my limbs, I immediately knew it was extremely serious and possibly terminal. Every few months I would get more sick and it has remained that way for the past 6 years I have been getting worse every few months.

My disease has become so severe that I cannot continue school or study from cognitive impairment, I can barely eat anything without getting pain and it is impossible to gain any weight.I can barely walk outside because of shortness of breath, I cannot leave the house in the summer.the disease is extremely painful and disabling every day is a battle with pain, and controlling symptoms.

several doctors have diagnosed me with a neurological disease which they say is untreatable and not curable.

so for the past few weeks I have been visiting gun shops while I lie to my parents and tell them I am going to the gym.

everyone treats me like crap especially my parents.

my body has reached its physical limits, I cannot endure any more pain from the disease it is impossible, so I am going to buy guns and kill myself."
dwc1gd,SuicideWatch,The first day after is really weird [TW: Suicide Attempt],"So last night I tried to kill myself. I had every intention on doing so. I was sitting in my car with my gun to my chin and I pulled the trigger but nothing happened. I usually keep a round in the chamber when I carry, so didn't think to rack the slide, instead I just cocked the hammer back. For whatever reason, maybe it was because I wasn't thinking straight, I never racked it after loading the magazine. So when I pulled the trigger, no bullet came out, and it was the loudest click I have ever heard in my life. O drove home and gave my roommate (who is also my best friend) my gun and I told him what happened. I cried, he cried, and he asked me to sleep in his bed with him so he would know I was there. I don't know how but I managed to sleep. But now, everything just feels off. I can't look people in the face, it's hard to concentrate at work, I don't know what to say to anyone. I wasn't supposed to be here today. People are telling me go to a doctor, but I don't want to, I've been through that before and it doesn't help. If you're reading this, thank you. I just needed a place where I could say what happened and not be judged or baker-acted or something."

fure5q,SuicideWatch,I wish humanity would burn to ashes.,"I hate society and its concepts of virtue and success.

It's telling that it's taken an outbreak upending everything in society as we know it for people to start recognizing fucked up things.

Suddenly, some employers are implementing much more reasonable policies to allow their employees to work from or just stay at home.

Standardized testing requirements in some places has been suspended, almost like they've finally realized there are more important things on the line. Not that that matters to me, because I'm a college dropout that sees degrees as badges of blind obedience.

Carbon emissions have dramatically decreased. Don't know the full facts, but I've heard that air quality in notorious places like China is actually somewhat breathable now.

So I hate when people tell me things like how it gets better, or how I'm going to be successful. Everyone beats around the bush. No one wants to admit that I'm a horrible and talentless person that just hates everyone and everything. I wish humanity would burn to ashes.

I dropped out of college 3 years ago and I've been living with my parents since then. I have no job and don't really do much from day to day. About the only passion I have in life is video games, and I've recently found enjoyment writing reviews and overviews of RPGs on a personal blog. Of course, because I don't know shit about promoting it, it's never going to take off in views and I'll never be able to actually TAKE that passion anywhere.

So, as someone who's dead weight right now, this pandemic is essentially what I've wanted. A disaster that grinds human society to a screeching halt, so I don't have to feel guilty about being cooped up in my room all day instead of trying to throw myself at a wage slave job.

And yet it hasn't changed a thing for me. I still hate myself for even thinking such toxic things. I'm still useless. I still have no future. With each passing day, the feeling that I'm running out of time and have to die soon gets stronger.

The funny thing is that I see a lot of people feeling guilty for doing nothing all day but playing video games. Ironically, that's the life I've always WANTED. If I didn't have to worry about things like school, grades, finding a job, and so on, I could live at my own pace. I'd read more books, learn random interesting topics, immerse myself into human culture, and learn more about the world on top of further exploring my passion for gaming. And you could argue that I could do ALL of that stuff right now since I'm not attending school and don't have a job. But the constant internal reminder that I'm a waste of resources stops me from doing that. The thought process is that I'm going to kill myself in the future anyways, so why bother?

I was so close to the finish line. One of my current ""obligations"", if you can call it that, is that I've pre-ordered two copies of the upcoming Final Fantasy VII Remake. One for myself, and one for a friend who paid me to get his copy since he couldn't pre-order it himself for certain reasons. The plan was that once that favor was done, and once I've gotten a chance to finish the game myself, I could finally let myself die. 2020 would be the final chapter to my pathetic story. There were lots of other games that I'm excited for this year that I was willing to give up on waiting for because I wanted to kill myself before June.

But this pandemic has ultimately taken that away from me. The shelter-at-home orders mean that I'm never going to be completely alone in the house, so I can't just attempt a suicide without any huge risks. And even if I DID pull it off, the last thing I'd want is for the funeral/corpse disposal to be complicated because of this outbreak.

The one silver lining is that I'll now get a chance to play upcoming games like Xenoblade Definitive Edition and Trails of Cold Steel IV before the time comes for me to kill myself. But I'm not sure that means much when I'm a terrible person holding so much hate for humanity inside of me, as well as the general sense that I'm trapped in a corner because I'm a college dropout with no job, no future, and no way to escape a life of wage slavery and overwork other than suicide.

I hate the fact that I always seem to have trouble putting my feelings into words, too. I've been looking through and editing this post multiple times just to try and get everything down. Why is it that I have so much that I want to bitch about sometimes, yet when I have the opportunity to write or speak about it, the words simply evaporate like dry ice?

Deep down, I secretly wish someone would finally just man up and tell me that I'm useless, rude, and toxic. To me, finally hearing someone tell me that I'm a bad person will make it feel like I finally have permission to die."
emazwe,SuicideWatch,“I hope my death makes more sense than my life.”,Quote from Joker. Feeling depressed today. Bipolar is a bitch. Felt like sharing.
bw6duh,SuicideWatch,"A thing about me. Please, if you have the time, please read it. I just want to let things out.","I'm posting this here because I just need a place to scream. Sometimes, I wonder if I'm just not built for this world. If maybe I'm not mentally strong enough to take on anything and if maybe I should just take my life because I feel like I cant accomplish anything.

Anyways, hi, my name is Autumn, I'm 19 y/o transgirl and I graduated high school last year. As far as I'm aware provided my psychologist and psychiatrist are correct I have Borderline Personality Disorder, Asperger's Syndrome, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and ADHD. I've always had a hard time growing up. I was bullied so much in school, my parents werent the best, they physically abused me when I was a child, and mentally abused me in middle/high school. A part of me doesnt hate them (at least my mother) because I feel like they're not trying to hurt me nor do they hate me, they just dont know how to properly raise me or approach me. They just decided to go the ""old school"" route of hitting me until I got better grades. Anyways, I hate my father. He's a manchild with anger issues who does destructive things and I wish he would just disappear. 

Anyways, onto my personal life with friends. I am severely emotionally unstable, I experience things in extremes and I always constantly split between loving and hating my friends. I constantly fear being abandoned or left alone and result in drastic measures to avoid those situations, I selfharm, I spend so much money. Haha, I had a job with an income of 1.6k monthly without any bonus commission, but I'd spend all of it on everything. I cant control it. I always ended up burning bridges with my friendships, I didn't mean to, I dont want to. But I cant control my behaviors and I hate it. I'm trying real hard to go to therapy, I'm hoping I can start DBT to help me with my BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder).

I just want to have friends I interact with on a regular basis and play games with. I try my best to reach out but I guess others are busy playing with their friends or just overall not noticing me. Which can really hurt I guess. One recent thing I've really gotten into is FFXIV. I try to ask other friends to play but, I just get ignored and such. It hurts a lot. I dont hate them I think, I dont. I just, I wish I had friends they have and play with. It gets really boring and lonely. Aside from those things, sometimes, I wonder if everything would be better if I was dead. You see, I never knew escapism existed until a few months ago, and that's when I realized how for the past 19 years my coping mechanism of constantly retreating to the fantasy world I've created in my head was extremely unhealthy, and because of it I dont see any reason in going on, I think what's stopping me now is how Ill informed I am with taking my own life and how afraid I am of coming out with permanent damage and not death. Aside from that, there are 2 other people whom I love very much and cant bear to leave alone. My dream job is to edit videos for a YouTube channel or do something game grumps-esque with a friend. I'd love that so much, but that's just a dream, given the current state of YouTube and everything like that, the chances are that's not going to happen. Sometimes I just wish I could fall into a permanent sleep and live forever in my dreams.

Anyways, thanks for letting me rumble a bit. I'm not happy. I'm not okay. I dont want to be alive. But maybe i can make it through, i just sometimes wish i had friends like others I see, but I'm extremely shy and suck at conversation and such, its really hard. I think I'm going to go cry some more now, I'll see you all some other time. 

If you took the time to read through all this, thank you... from the bottom of my heart."
aqnayj,SuicideWatch,"I despise when mentally healthy people say ""go see a therapist""",Tehehe omg why didn't I think of that sooner. I'll just go see a therapist and they'll give me the magic antidote to my perpetual cravings for death that have persisted for years. Thanks mentally healthy individual.
f4q5ee,SuicideWatch,Only staying alive for others at this point,"My mother is everything to me, if I was to kill myself it would destroy her. She lost her husband last year and I'm basically the only thing she lives for now. 

I'm basically a failure at life, I'm 24 years old, only ever had 2 temporary jobs. Never had a girlfriend. I have some friends but none of them would consider me as their best friend, even though I consider them as mine. 

In society, my family are seen as outcasts and people act as if we are beneath them. I feel like a failure to my mother when she's speaking to somebody in public as I've achieved nothing in my lifetime. 

These thoughts enter my head daily, I want a way out but I couldn't do it to my family. If there's ever a purpose for my death or a situation where I may need to die in place of someone else, I'm taking it."
bj1jua,SuicideWatch,I want out of the rat race,Haven’t even started and I don’t want to.  I don’t care about my “potential”.  I’d rather just not exist.
8ssuet,SuicideWatch,The annoying lexicon of suicide dissuasion,"If anyone out here is legitimately on the verge of a crisis and seeking the slightest nudge of a signal from the universe that they ought to just go through with it, I'd strongly urge them to not read any further because I would never dream of being that catalyst to anyone. I'm a miserable, wretched and broken person with the unfortunate burden of being paralytically self-aware which makes me incapable of doing anything that I can poke holes of rationality in.

I fucking hate the entire existing system and lexicon of suicide-support. The hollow meaningless and empty cliched routine that everyone instantly spews at you is just nauseating to me. In a strange way I think it is an effective deterrent because the second someone hears words like ""you're not the only one going through this"" or ""you have so much to live for"" or ""things will get better"", I imagine that even at least a tiny part of their brains is so revolted by what they hear that they're momentarily distracted from their hopes to end it all. For gods fucking sake could people shut the fuck up for one second and stop talking to me like I'm a fragile little toddler having the news of my parents impending divorce broken to me or something?

If you'll bear with me and be patient, let me explain myself. We're all fully realized, functioning adults here. We don't get to the point of contemplating suicide because our favorite boyband broke up. We don't need banal paltry consolation from random strangers on the internet who will say to us ""Your'e not alone, we understand"", before vanishing and never having any form of meaningful contact with us again. What is the point of some arbitrary words of kindness from a person who has absolutely nothing to do with your life? The reason we're in this fucking mess here is because of people in OUR own lives, tragedies in OUR own lives, failures, loss, heartbreak, devastation, clinical  depression that you can't afford to treat and even if you could afford to treat it, the side effects of the medication include even more suicidal thoughts. 

I wish people would just respect that we all have our own troubled journeys and we all have our reasons for posting here. It is incredibly short-sighted, offensively stupid and patronizing for someone else who has no idea what you have been through to just tell you that everything is going to be hunky dory. I wish people would just say ""You know what, I hear you. I get it. You do what you need to."" Because that to me is exponentially more empathetic, meaningful, profound and compassionate than the typical ""no you're wrong, stop what you're doing, think of everyone who will miss you"" bullshit approach.

That's even the thing that bothers me so much about professional help. I'm literally dying here, dragging my disgusting raggedy corpse out of bed every day is pure agony, I physically cannot even cry any more because I'm so dehydrated from all the crying from the night before, the only reason I get out of bed is to go take a piss after jerking off 14 times a day for the temporary 30-second high of endorphins it gives me that is enough to get me to walk to the fridge and drink some expired orange juice. And a stranger has the audacity to tell me that it's entirely my responsibility to work even harder to save even more money and to seek out a professional therapist to talk to. Do you see what's inherently fucked up about that? It's not the responsibility of indifferent parents who know so little about you that they wouldn't understand 90&#37; of your suicide note if you left them one. It's not the responsibility of the people who treated you like shit, of your friends who haven't noticed anything was wrong in over 6 years and who wouldn't ever even know you were dead because your facebook profile would still be up. There's nobody. It's all you. YOU ALONE are expected to try even harder when you can barely walk, you weigh 15 pounds, your hair is falling out, your teeth are loose, it is your responsibility to seek help. 

Let me give you a hypothetical. Let's say that the very problem that I have is that I have nobody in my life who would WANT to talk to me of their own accord. That's my problem - that nobody wants to talk to me. Then how is the solution to that problem to PAY somebody to talk to me? That simply furthers the problem by reinforcing the point. That even a designated ""helper"" will only talk to me if I incentivize them with money. And so the problem persists. I don't want a shrink. I don't want random strangers who spew meaningless well wishes just so they can feel warm and fuzzy inside and imagine they helped someone somewhere across the world. I just want people to be fucking honest and real for one solitary second and say ""Damn dude. Shit sounds rough. I honestly don't know what I'd do if I were in your position. If you think killing yourself is the most viable option you have - I guess you've probably already considered every other alternative. You do you. Godspeed."" That would mean the world to me. That would be such a pure, profound, refreshingly objective thought. And that would help more than any of the other sugar-coated infantile nonsense.

We're fucking people. We still have to work hard every day to even afford to pay the electricity bills and the internet bills so we can come on Reddit and navigate to Suicide Watch and type a post here. We're not goddamn idiots who are gullible enough to think everything is all unicorns and rainbows just cause a stranger tells us that our parents will miss us when we're gone. Some of us have shitty fucking parents or no parents at all. Some off our corpses won't be discovered for months because we're just that lonely and nobody in our lives gives two fifths of a fuck about us to even wonder if something is wrong if we don't answer our phones a couple of times. Some of us are ONLY still alive because our cats need to be fed and if we were gone, they'd end up in a shelter because we have nobody else who would take them in. 

I don't know man. I've rambled on long enough and probably incited enough downvotes by this point. I just wish people didn't have such a simplistic view of things. It's not like you can walk up to a depressed person and say ""hey don't be sad"" and they'll be like ""omg wow! i never saw it that way before! i'm all better now!"". You can't go up to a suicidal person and say ""hey, don't kill yourself."" It'd be so much better if you could say ""hey, I get it. I'm sorry. Maybe nobody in your life will miss you. I probably won't miss you either. But I do hope you make it out of this sometime."""

I’ve waited so long for things to change and it just seems like it’s not going to happen for me. I would rather not have to live in agony every day. I wish there was an easier way to do this.

ekhjqm,SuicideWatch,I am sorry mom and dad.,"I want C. to take care of my dog.  

I want my father and mother to take over my house. If they don’t want the responsibility, then I wish for them to sell the home and keep the money. Because they gave me a second chance at life and put resources into me. It’s the least I can do, allow them to recoup something. I know they would rather have me, they never failed me, but unfortunately I cannot go on anymore.

My snap-on toolbox should be given to R.. He can keep my tools.

My biological mother L. will get half of my personal belongings, clothes and anything that will help her keep the memories of me.

Anything else that I own will be donated or thrown away.  

This is nobodies fault. So many friends, family, and doctors tried their hardest to save me. Please know it’s not your fault. Please forgive me. I know that people will question my actions. People will wish I pushed harder and not have done this. I have been in despair for so many years. Suffering silently and trying my hardest to get better; to have peace. I unfortunately couldn’t bear the weight of my mental illness. It changed me, ripped away every fiber of my being. Left me broken and unrecognizable. I lost everything I love to my sickness. I look in the mirror daily and have no idea who I am. All I see is a deeply broken man. I ask that you keep the memories of me for who I was. The unbroken A.. The comforter, the loving person, the selfless A., the man who breaks bread with strangers in need, the one full of compassion and unconditional love. Please don’t remember me for the monster I have become. The angry man, having no patience or control, selfish and hurtful towards those I love; bipolar. I cannot bear that reality. Knowing that I am not me anymore. No matter how hard I try, the A. I once was is dead. I miss his softness, his love, his intellect, his ability to understand and protect others. All I am left with is a shell. I look like A.. But I assure you, he is completely dead inside. Nothing is left of him. No matter how hard I try, I cannot revive him. He is gone, and I carry the weight of who I once was. No more am I actually alive, my fire is gone, my will to live completely destroyed. I am just a shell now. I have unbearable headaches daily. I can’t speak with articulate words anymore. My emotions are numb now. I don’t feel anything. My mind whispers daily that relief will come only when I give up.  That my peace will come when I quit. I have never been a quitter, I have always been a fighter. But for the first time in my life, I face an enemy whom I cannot defeat. My mind is my enemy now instead of my best friend, as it used to be. I know that people will think I am selfish. I ask you to please not carry this pain. It’s unbearable and not worthy to carry. I wish this cup was not mine to drink from, but the poison has come to me anyways. I know that nobody will get to ask me why? Or find the closure they seek. Please find closure in this fact. I am sick, if I wasn’t sick I wouldn’t have taken my life. I couldn’t bear this weight anymore. It has destroyed and taken from me everything that I am. My ability to think, my emotions to feel, my fire, my life. It has taken everything that I was. Nothing is left of me that is me. I wish I could kill what’s wrong with me and still live. But the reality is that I cannot. Please forgive me and allow me the dignity to be remembered for who I was, not what I became. It gives me great shame to know what I am now. To know that my smile is nothing but a mask, my eyes an ocean of despair. I have tried the medications, the therapy, held on to hope. But nothing will fix this. Just as cancer takes over a man and steals his life. So it is with my severe mental illness. This is a cancer, invisible, in the mind. Nothing can cured this. Nothing could have prevented this. I lived a good life. I traveled and felt the world beneath my feet, met good people everywhere I went, and it was beautiful. My life was not lived in vain. I was given a second chance by my parents and they showed me love and compassion. They showed me how to live again. I will forever be thankful for them and the sacrifices they made for a stranger, as they consider me their own child. My life would not have had joy or love without my family. I wish this illness never happened. I have overcome so much in life, but I couldn’t overcome this.  

Sincerely,

A.

I know this will hurt, please know it’s not your fault, it’s nobodies fault. With the last piece of love left in my heart, though it is not much, I wish to share it with everyone who knew me. No matter if we had problems, I forgive you, please forgive me."
dsm2ni,SuicideWatch,My Suicide Note.," 

I don’t feel as if I need to really explain much; you knew I was suffering. 

Admittedly or not; you knew. 

And you can say I’m selfish.

And you can say that I’m a coward. 

And you can say that I couldn’t have been helped.

And you can say that this mindset was a choice.

And that you don’t understand.

And that you didn’t expect this. 

And that you wish things were different.

And that you’re hurting. 

But you’ll be okay. 

And I’m not selfish. 

And I’m not a coward. 

And you’re right, maybe I could’ve been saved; but I wasn’t. 

Someone once told me that I wasn’t broken, that I just needed someone to choose me. To love me. 

And that’s more than true. 

How can I feel secure and purposeful and worthy when my own parents didn’t want to be in my life? 

Everyone that matters sees this light in me; including my parents. 

That I’m special. 

I am luminous. 

I am warm.

I am beautiful.

I am talented. 

I am smart. 

I am magnetic.

I am powerful. 

But at the end of the day, they choose to remove themselves. To enjoy my presence like an heirloom in the back of the hutch. 

Only ever touched for your own gain, your own pleasure, 

Just so show that you have me. 

But my beauty, my accomplishments—those are all mine. 

And I was left alone nonetheless at the end of each day, each week, each month. 

Beautiful they say, precious even. 

Kept safe. Appreciated. 

Used when deemed appropriate. 

Treated with care, sure, for the most part—  

When treated at all. 

Packed away. 

And it’s fine that you guys couldn’t be bothered much.

I tried to give myself meaning. 

To feel loved without touch. 

But when the only touch I can remember is that of those who have only ever hurt me, 

And my voice muted 

My pain overlooked

My cracks sanded over, but never filled

What could really be expected?

My mother HURT ME. 

She hurt some of you. 

She hurt herself. 

And the elephant in the room is that we’re all fucked up because of it. 

IM fucked up because of it. 

I remember. 

I remember.

I remember. 

I FUCKING REMEMBER. 

I wish you’d let me talk about it.

I wish you would’ve be angry with me for hurting.

I wish that crying was acceptable and not a sign of weakness in our home. 

I wish that I was never told that I was the downfall of our family. 

Because I wasn’t. 

And news flash: my mother wasn’t either. 

WHAT HAPPENED to her was. 

And I wasn’t alive yet. I don’t know what happened to her. 

But something did. And YOU know. 

So please, on my literal dead body, fucking talk about it. 

Let this be a lesson. Not about how you treated me, because that’s not what I’m getting at. This ain’t about me. 

Let this be a lesson about truth. About honesty. 

Talk about your traumas. 

I made my own decision, I did. 

Talk so each other. 

Please. 

I tried. 

I tried to take the broken pieces, the wholesome ones, the dark, and light, the beautiful, the confusing, the questionable, the hurtful, and loving, the wrong and the right pieces and to make something of myself. 

I tried to create something with what I had.

To play the cards I was dealt… 

but Rayvaun if anyone knows I’m awful at card games (did I just joke in my suicide note? yeah I think I did). 

Maybe you guys will be able to use this as a card in your hand, or a piece to your puzzle, 

but the game didn’t make sense to me; the pieces just didn’t fit. 

So I folded. 

I’m not sorry for what I did, unfortunately. 

I think this is what I needed and what you guys needed too; you’ll see. 

God sent me here to teach a lesson. 

About truth. 

About pain. 

About compassion. 

About how time doesn’t stop. 

Or something, I don’t know. 

I don’t have much else to say. 

I hope that when it’s dark out, you feel me in the chill of the wind

That when it’s sunny, you can see me and feel my warmth on your skin 

When the ocean comes and goes, you imagine my curls in the air… free, unapologetic. 

I wish that Kevin could know how much I love him. 

Please take care of him. 

He’s an angel. Truly. 

Here’s to best chances 

At peace 

At closure 

At warmth

At forgiveness 

Cause when your new eyes meet mine, you won’t see

No lies 

Just love 

Like snow 

Like gold

I will be pure.

ci25z8,SuicideWatch,Is anyone else tired of life but too scared to kill themselves?,"Like I’m too scared of what happens after I die so idk

Edit: So I got a bible verse and a lot of religious shit from a guy in the dms, I don’t know if ai should turn to religion for comfort tho"
c6q9v1,SuicideWatch,How the fuck do you hold conversation?,"I have this problem where I can't really make any new friends thanks to me, failing to hold conversation. I'm sick of relying other people to be very talkative and just responding with filler words. Ive been stuck with the same friends for years. Don't get me wrong I'm thankful to have them in the first place but I feel like I'm starting to grow apart from them. I feel so alone and its all my fault. Thanks to me, struggling with meeting new people, keep eye contact, talk until you're comfortable with them etc. There are times where I just feel like I rather be alone than to talk to people. But why do I feel like this? I don't want to be by myself but sometimes I can't help but to only have myself as company.

There are times I know the other person just doesn't want to talk to me because I bring up generic topics to talk about (how are you doing? Any plans for today? What are you up to now?). But I don't know how to talk... I've been like this for years now. 

I don't want to stay alone because I end up overthinking everything and think the world hates me. Why the fuck am I like this? I need help!"
ahtfjv,SuicideWatch,I planned a get together to see my friends one last time and no one came,"I didn’t tell them why I wanted to hang out and I planned it a while ago so it wasn’t last minute. Everyone flaked. I try not to be a downer when they’re around. I honestly don’t think anyone knows how depressed I’ve been these past few months and I don’t know how to tell anyone. I had a therapist who I’d get all this stuff out to but she left so I haven’t been able to talk to anyone about how hopeless and useless I’ve felt in almost 7 months. I don’t feel like it’s fair to dump it all on my friends and even if I felt I could go to them I don’t know how to tell them.
I’ve planned to jump from a bridge on Monday January 21st. It’ll been cold enough that if I manage to survive the fall I’ll freeze to death in the river. Tomorrow I’m gonna watch the lunar eclipse alone. I’ve always liked stargazing.
Sorry, I have no one to talk to so I’m just shouting into the internet void again. If you’re reading, thank you for giving me a couple minutes of your time 

EDIT: I’m sorry if I’m not responding to some people. I really appreciate your support and I’m trying to but for some reason I get a notification of a comment but it doesn’t appear in the tread. I’m really sorry I promise I’m not trying to be ungrateful or anything 

EDIT 2: I really appreciate the support from all of you. I didn’t think this would get so many responses and I’m really sorry if I don’t respond to some because it’s a tad overwhelming. I did read every one and I just want thank you guys for listening to me for a minute. "
bnpt1y,SuicideWatch,Tired,Anyone else just feel extremely tired all the time? Like not wanting to do anything but stay in bed or waste time doing something meaningless?
bhkhxm,SuicideWatch,Ever wake up every morning and you want to die?,"My depression as constantly began to get worse and worse. It’s been years since my last suicide attempt and I was supposed to try again this year. But then I got a girlfriend, she loves for me cares for me and makes me feel great when we are together. But, even thought we live together I hardly get to see her because she works days and I work graveyard, so when I get home she has to leave. I see here a total of maybe 10 hours a work week. And all those hours I’m away I feel like nothing has changed since before I met her. I go into such deep depressions that I feel like my heart could stop at any moment (wouldn’t be opposed to it anyway). I’m scared to die, but I’m not scared of being dead. The only time I’m happy without her is if I smoke and that last a couple hours tops. I don’t know why I’m so sad. Plenty of people have it way worse then me and somehow they are happy without effort. I have it made, good job, love of my life, a place to lay me head at the end of the night. Sadness overwhelms me almost daily, I’ve tried everything I can. I wake up ever morning and wish I hadn’t. Living seems like an endless battle that I can’t win.  Everyone thinks I’m joking when I tell them I want to die, but honestly that’s the most truthful thing to ever leave my mouth. Anyone else have the same problem?"
dpu9ym,SuicideWatch,I think I have decided to do it.,"I have thought about suicide constantly for many years. My entire life, I have felt as though I have been genuinely cursed. Truly terrible things seem to happen to me with unusual frequency and I can't help but see that this is not how life is supposed to be. I can't even talk about my biggest problems, but a combination of mental illness, constant weight issues, being an outcast from society and seeing no hope for the future all contribute to these feelings.  I have tried holding out, I have tried soldiering on and I have done it for many years, but I live in a constant state of fear and suffering. My sister, who is probably the person I love most in the world, is one of the few reasons I have held on, because I felt that taking my life would hurt her. And I still believe that it would. But I have been thinking about how we are getting older, and it is not fair for me to rely on her as we become adults. She deserves to go have a good life as someone as truly beautiful and kind as she is deserves and if she is constantly hanging out with me, how can she ever have that? Honestly, I can't fight this anymore. I have seen therapists and taken antidepressants, but the only thing that helps me at all is abusing my anti anxiety medicine so I can sleep. I just really can't take it anymore and have stopped thinking about IF I should do it and more about how I should do it in a way that would least inconvenience the people I love the most. I'm thinking about going into the woods and just lying down and freezing to death or jumping in front of a train. I don't know why I am posting this, but I just needed to get this off my chest before I do it. Thank you for your time and I genuinely pray you all have lives better than mine."
huv6tj,SuicideWatch,Small penis = suicide,"Just turned 27, still a virgin. Been with a few women but it never works, they look at me like I'm the most disgusting piece of shit on the planet even though there's nothing I can do about it. It's not even about just being small, I don't care that I have to sit to pee or that I can't even masturbate properly. It's about living a lonely, unfulfilling life and how much society despises guys like me. I'm never going to find a partner or know what love feels like and it makes everything in life feel pointless. Never going to have a girlfriend or get married or have kids, it's all a waste of time. All because of something supposedly so ""trivial"". 

I feel like at least half the people who read that title immediately thought ""how pathetic, what a loser"" and that's part of the problem, this is never taken seriously. It's hard to get through one day without seeing some kind of reminder that people hate and are disgusted by small guys, and yet it's somehow our fault for feeling bad about it. People say it's our attitude, and I have to wonder, where do they think this attitude comes from? Do you think we're born full of self-loathing and insecurity? I've been rejected by everyone I've ever been intimate with and it's always specifically because of my size. People, not size queens or shallow idiots, regular people have preferences and make it clear they don't like small dicks. And the thing is that's totally fine, you like what you like, no shame there. But why do people have to hate us so much on top of that? Isn't it enough that most of us are extremely unhappy? 

I was bullied constantly in high school after I was seen in the change rooms. Was called ""trans"", ""pindick"", etc. Then I'd come home and see the 'award-winning' Australian anti-speeding ad on TV every night (it's on youtube). I wonder how many other young guys saw that and knew that they were that disgusting, horrible thing that no one wanted to be compared to. That's just one example but it's everywhere and when it's directed at you it's hard to not become hyper aware of all of it. 

Despite the bullying, I think trying a condom for a first time is what made me realise how worthless I was. Regular ones were way too big, even snug ones don't stay on. It feels like every guy goes through this stage, it's like being put into categories that determine your value. Regular? Well, nothing special but at least you're normal, all fine. XL? Impressive, a real man who everyone will be happy with. Small? Ugh... just sit in the corner and don't bother anyone. I knew what the average was from reading online, so when I finally measured I wished I was dead, I've never felt more worthless as a person. 

You might think that because penis size is a private thing that makes it okay, and easier to deal with. But it couldn't be further from the truth. I'm short and really ugly as well and when people insult those things I hardly care, but penis size is different. When I walk into a room, people immediately know I'm short and ugly, and that's the end of it. What can they do to me? Not to mention that anyone who insults those things gets called out because neither are considered acceptable. But when it comes to penis size it's completely fair game. No one speaks up, and having to laugh along and pretend I'm normal to not 'out' myself is honestly exhausting. Being ugly and short doesn't bother me much at all, but having a small dick does. Size is inherently tied to our masculinity and self-worth whether we want it to be or not. I wish I could change and not care about it but I can't. 

I know that no one really gives a shit, it's all just words on a screen isn't it? People don't comprehend that we're real people and statistically you probably know at least one guy who is small and struggling to deal with it, it could even be a family member or a friend. You'll never know it though, because he laughs along with the jokes and keeps up the facade to appear normal while inside he hates himself. It'd be interesting to know how many men are depressed and suicidal because of this. I guarantee it'd be way more than you might think. Even on this sub there are countless posts from guys who are suicidal over their size. But as I said earlier this issue is not taken seriously, we're seen as ""pathetic incels"" and told it's our own fault. Size is trending up and society is just becoming more obsessed with bigger dicks and more disgusted by small, it's only going to get worse. 

There needs to be a way to detect this from birth, no sane parent would've kept me. Ah well, nothing of value lost, one less ugly small-dicked guy to disappoint people I guess. I've been so unhappy for so long, I don't remember what anything good feels like. Since realising I was always going to be alone and unwanted, even things I used to enjoy don't make me happy at all. It just feels like wasting time. Being born like this almost guarantees a miserable life, but at least I don't have to be here."
ekbhf5,SuicideWatch,1 hour to go,"I've already made up my mind, nobody can talk me out of it so don't even bother with 'dont do it', please
I always wanted to feed ducks, never did. I'm partially housebound thanks to agoraphobia and if the ducks touch me I'd have a panic attacks thanks to OCD, so I have never fed ducks.

This is just one of the things I never did with my life, I've wasted it and spent the first 6 years being happy then the rest feeling unhappy wishing I relived those years. 

I don't have a gun so my death will be painful as hell but its my only method

EDIT: I did it, but my instincts are running wild telling me to tell my parents, what do I say to them

EDIT 2: It failed, I'm in the hospital but I won't be admitted to the ward because of my agoraphobia, I wouldn't be able to handle it.

UPDATE
I tried to reply to you all while in the emergency room but I had no service, here's a bit of information on what happened.
I had a champagne flute full of disinfectant, however I fucked up. Turns out I was too confident that cleaning chemicals are always toxic, turns out the disinfectant was citric acid based.
I tried to kill myself with citric acid.
I didn't even read the back, I'm so fucking stupid. Ny organs aren't even partially affected.
I was not admitted to the psych ward, but I nearly was. My psychiatrist understood that due to my agoraphobia it would not help to admit me, so he vouched for my discharge, which I was discharged 12 hours after I went to the hospital

I had an ECG to check my heart, where I had to take off my shirt, my dad saw my self harm scars. (My mum already knew about it but my dad didn't, he has not mentioned it yet.)"

What’s the point? The only reason I’ve stayed here past 12 years old is because of my sister and now she’s a little brat who hates me because all I do is stay in bed. My parents don’t say it but I know they are disappointed and wish I was a better child. 
All I have is my girlfriend who I can’t even say is my gf because her fucking ex might swoop her off her feet again before I get the chance to even kiss her for the first time. 
I can’t open up to anyone close to me because to me it’s not opening up it’s just dumping all my problems on them. 
I just wish I didn’t fucking exist, that people didn’t care about me and that I could die, or start self-harming in peace again. I mean I did relapse but I can’t even relapse on my wrist so I doesn’t hurt as bad I have to cut on my thighs. 
I just want it to be over. All of it. My depression, my anxiety, my fucking undiagnosed shit, my family problems, I wish that my ex had never molested me. I just want it to be over and I can’t talk to anyone but internet strangers about it. I’m pathetic."

7ry9uc,SuicideWatch,My name is John,"I don't know what I'm looking for here. I just want to be heard. I'm posting this on my actual account because I want people to know who I am.

Every day I wake up to a physical pain in my chest. It's the kind of pain that can't be rid of through Aspirin or ibuprofen or Tylenol, it's much like hunger, except it can't be satiated. Every day I wake up and feel it. But I go to class; I do homework; I smile; I laugh; all because that's what people are supposed to do. I'm supposed to get dressed and walk out of my apartment every day prepared to take on the world. But I can't. I'm tired. I'm sick of it all. I'm sick of being alone. 

Every day I cry. Most of the time it's when my roommate is gone, but sometimes I don't have that luxury. I work at my school's library, and the other day I was assigned to sort books. While I was working, I lost it. I had to sit in the bathroom for 10 minutes and try to collect myself. When I finally left, I stared at the same title for 30 minutes, all while contemplating walking out of my shift and ending it.

I just don't know what to do. I've never had a girlfriend, and I was a virgin up until 21 til I finally had enough and paid a prostitute. It was shit. I couldn't perform because I was drunk, and she was obviously just in it for the money. No passion whatsoever. All through high school I watched my friends get in relationships. I listened to them talk about relationships and hung out with them and their girlfriends. I enjoyed their company, I considered them friends, but every day something inside of me collapsed a little.

Then, finally, at 22 I met a girl through Tinder. I really really REALLY enjoyed talking to her. We talked for like two weeks before we met up, and it was the first time I've been happy in years. Every day I was checking my phone multiple times a minute. Some people say that a relationship won't fill the hole inside of you, but after that night I can say with certainty that it is exactly what is missing in my life. I want someone to want me and enjoy my company. 

When we met up, I thought things went well. We hooked up. The sex was good - really fucking good - but what made me the happiest was the fact that someone liked me enough to do it with me. But a day later she messaged me and told me that she found me too awkward to talk to and that we shouldn't talk to each other any more. Now, this was a woman who has slept with nine other guys, some of whom were one night stands, and kept in touch with *every* other one of them. This was a woman who dated a man who could only eat pizza, burgers, and french fries, because he had such a bad case of anxiety that any other foods would cause him to break down.

But *I* was too awkward to keep in touch with. *I* was too much work. 

And that broke me. Whatever it was inside of me that had been giving all my life finally collapsed. For years, I've tried to socialize. I've tried clubs, I've tried jobs, I've tried talking to people around me in classes, and it hasn't done anything. I thought maybe it was because I wasn't physically attractive, but then I got in shape and it changed nothing. So I gained a little weight back, and then I met her. I had a chance with a girl. I thought she liked talking to me as I liked talking to her. But I was wrong.

Through her I discovered the truth; I'm fundamentally flawed. I can't socialize. I'm not attractive. There is *nothing* physically impressive about me. I have no hobbies. I'm boring as shit. I'm awkward. I have no redeeming qualities *at all*. I don't know what to do about it either. I tried a number of hobbies. Skateboarding, puzzles, reading, television, exercise, drawing, instruments, etc. It all bored the shit out of me. I had *zero* fun. 

I lie to everyone. I tell people I got laid in high school. I tell them I had a good size friend group. The truth is, I've never had more than a couple friends at a time, and I've never been in a relationship. Every day this eats me up. Every day I wake up, I'm disappointed that I didn't fucking die in my sleep."
ff4un1,SuicideWatch,After a week long disappearance and a gun purchase I finally admitted myself into the psych ward.,And for the first time in over a decade I am getting the help I have needed. It's never too late.

e9yp04,SuicideWatch,The only thing keeping me from killing myself is my wife and daughter. I am beginning to resent them for it.,"I've talked to two therapist. They both encourage me to get a divorce (after a LOT of therapy). The issue is, I really think I can't handle the stress of a divorce. 

I love my daughter very much, and I want to see her grow up. However, I feel like a fucking robot that can't make anyone happy. I work harder and people ask for more of me.

Both my parents have died in the past year and my last words to both were ""fuck you"" (one deservedly, one not so much). I came from very humble beginnings and worked myself into management and after my dad died my work went to shit and I am getting canned. 

I just don't want to do any of this anymore, but I do becauee I have to. Not sure what I need or if I need anything from here, but it feels better to type it. 8 times I have had serious thoughts about suicide this year, everytime I think of my daughter and realize I can't.

The only thingnthatbreally help is smoking shittons of weed which, of course, leaves my wife dissappointed in me (I have been approved by a physician and live in an legal state. 

My younger brother is in jail and the whole system isndesigned tontake money from families and with me losing my job, it is expenaive to even talk to him.

Our world is cruel and I don't want to live in it.

I spent 10 years in the Army and did 3 tours in a Combat Arms job. I've earned real medals (bronze star with a V, ARCOM with a V) for actions in combat. No one gives a shit. No one cutsbyou any slack for killing for college money. For digging up IEDs for a poverty wage. For losing friends. 

And all I am is a disposable piece in this machine, school, work, the government, family. It's all just people in a line waiting for their piece of me.All this world and the people in it want is to take. I have nothing left to give. I am dead inside. 

I'll wake up and do it again tomorrow. I will wake up, get the babybready while my wife takes a shower. Drop off the baby. And gontrain my replacement and apply for jobs that will reject my resume. I'll home and work on my MBA homework so I can go hate my life for hopefully more money down the road. Fuck this all."
idyt4f,SuicideWatch,I Think Quitting Is The Only Option Left For Me Right Now,"I (16M) currently live in India with my father, step-mother and elder sister. I heard that my biological mother prayed to God (I am an atheist while my family is religious) for having a son (for no particular reason, she just wanted to have a son). You must think that my mother really loves me right? No. You are wrong. She divorced my father and left us (including me) two years ago. We were a broken family then. We are still a broken family now.

Now, I currently have severe depression, anxiety, OCD, insomnia, orthostatic hypotension and intermittent explosive disorder. I have lost my hunger, my sleep (I sleep at around 5:00 am everyday) and my happiness (or rather blissful ignorance). I do not go to school. I simply cannot because according to me, it's just meaningless. School is just a place where there is only mindless competition. The ""students"" just compete with each other in the exams to get more marks (by rot-learning and forgetting everything after giving the ""exams"") and brag about it. They do not actually gain any ""knowledge"" (as it is called by the society).

For the past few months, I have realised some painful truths regarding this world and life. I will not write all of them here because it'll be too long but in short, I have realised that we are all going to die someday but people in this world still keep on breeding (in a dying planet which is full of chaos) and create problems and chaos for the others. They don't give a fuck about others. They only care about themselves. 

I went to a couple of psychologists and a psychiatrist for depression. The psychologists just kept on saying bullshit like life is worth living, that you have to fight, etc. and did not even listen to my points. The psychiatrist just gave me a couple of medicines and a dozen of tests because ""he wanted to see why I could not understand reality"". WTF? You know what? My parents did exactly as the doctor said despite of me telling them that the doctor could not understand me. When I started my medication, I felt so awful that I could not even think about ANYTHING. The medicines just made my mind handicapped. I told my parents about this. But they just said that I HAVE to continue the medication because the DOCTOR gave it me (the same psychiatrist who did not even understand me). I finally stopped taking the medicines after a HUGE chaos in our house. 

A few months ago, we went out for shopping. My family pressurized me to go and talk with a salesman despite knowing that I have social anxiety. My father just said, ""How the hell will you take care of me when I get older?"" That day, I realized my purpose in life. It was to become a slave to my parents. 

Whenever I try to talk to my ""family"", they just keep on ignoring me. They just tell each other to not pay any mind to what I say and that I am insane. They don't even care about me. Everyone in this family (except me) has someone or the other to share their feelings with (and they do it all day). My sister has her friends and boyfriend. My father has his friends and step-mom. My step-mom has my father (she only cares about him and herself). 

They don't even take COVID-19 seriously. All 4 of us have had symptoms of COVID-19 (one after another) but only I took it seriously and wore a mask whenever I was near them. I repeatedly tell them to wear a mask while being near each other, wash hands after sneezing and coughing but they don't listen. My step-mother is strictly anti-mask (while still having the symptoms of COVID-19). Whenever I tell them that there is a chance that we might have caught COVID-19, they just simply say that I am pessimistic, that I am insane, that I am saying unholy things, etc. and shout at me. They are full of shitty ideas. They believe in trash like homeopathy and superstitions (both of which I hate). Whenever I try to tell them that these things are illogical, they just start bashing me and tell me to keep my ""beliefs"" to myself and don't tell them about it. 

A few days ago, we had an incident where my father and I got slightly injured. But my sister and step-mother just tended to my father. They gave him medicines and ointments and sympathized with him. They didn't even look at my injuries. I could not even walk properly for a few days because of my injuries. They absolutely did not give a damn about me. It seemed like I was non-existent. 

This ""family"" has completely isolated me ever since I started trying to tell them my thoughts and how I feel. I am completely lonely in this selfish and cruel world. 

You know what? I did not sign up for this. I can't eat, sleep, etc. without thinking about how people just keep breeding for such selfish reasons. I think I am going insane because of this hatred. I just want to die. But the problem is that there is a law in my country (India) that people who attempted suicide and survived, will be arrested. The Indian society just cares about staus and money. They just want to breed and force their children into becoming doctors, engineer, lawyers and pilots so that they have enough money to take care of their parents. Everyone in here just cares about getting rich, settling down and having children (who are supposed to be taking care of their ""parents"" and listen to them at once; basically slaves). Please help me. What the hell should I do?"
ch265t,SuicideWatch,My dad hanged himself today,"I'm in bed now and I just need to write down my thoughts. He was a difficult man, in the sense that his upbringing didn't allow him to believe that he was worthy of love if he wasn't succesful. I just found out that for the past year he'd been covering up the fact that his second company (he lost the first one, worth millions, during the housing crisis) was failing. He'd been getting in with some bad people to stay afloat apparently and he was getting in debt with them too. He just took his life, leaving only a note saying he had a lot of debt and he couldn't deal with it anymore. Not so much as a 'I love all of you'.

My mother is devastated. Me and my sister are just trying to be there for her...

But to be honest. I've also been struggling with depression my entire life. Me and my dad were very much alike and related so much on that level. I thought he was the strongest person I knew. He was literally my hero.

And now I'm just wondering what this all means. How could he have done this? My mom is feeling guilty about being angry but... we are all literally heading for immanent financial ruin. We will lose everything. He was the breadwinner.

I just wish he would have talked to us. I miss him so much already. He was my best friend. Where do I go from here..."

8gexfq,SuicideWatch,My cousin was killed by his girlfriend about a year ago.,"My cousin was killed by his girlfriend about a year ago. They were having a fight; she was angry and vindictive like always, they were screaming and arguing at each other. He was fed up with her shit and finally decided to leave her. She called the cops. He got in his car to leave. ""He's got a gun"" she screams. My cousin puts his hands up. Cops think he's raising a gun and they shoot him 14 times. My cousin is left in a semi comatose state. Over the next couple of weeks the hospital sends us updates of his condition; they claim he's improving rapidly and regaining neural and motor functions. It was all lies, He died in the hospital one week later. The Cops claim he was standing when he pointed a gun at them and they acted in self defense. More lies. The ballistics show that he was sitting in the car when he was shot.  For the longest time I never accepted that he was dead, It just never seemed real to me and For the longest time I have been suppressing my emotions but recently this horrible feeling of dread has been seeping over me. The thought of death or dying sends me into a state of intense anxiety complete with Panic attacks. I cant take this anymore; every time it happens I just think over and over again ""Why me""  ""Why did things have to be like this"" ""I wish i never even had these thoughts"" I don't want to feel like this anymore. This is no way to live I shouldn't have to feel like this every day. I want to Die. But i cant. It would cause my family too much grief and they would never understand why i did it. The Last thing I want to do is to spread grief to my family. I wish I had never of been born so I would never have to experience these feelings.

c02bcg,SuicideWatch,I tried hanging myself but feel happier,"i tried hanging myself a couple hours ago. i had planned it all day. i even asked for help for the first time ever. but still up until the hanging i felt hopeless. 
it didn’t work because i hung it too low and i was able to push myself out before i could breath my last breath. 
i took down the rope, got into bed, finished homework due today i guess and here i am. 
i feel happy though. not happy to be alive but just happy that a part of me is still fighting to live. i’m not sure how long this feeling will last but i do still intend on getting help because i’m worried that one day, when i’m not ready for it, i’ll just give up. 
i’m not sure where to go from here or how to hide the burning red mark across my neck but i do know i’m the happiest i’ve been in a while."

ekr9h1,SuicideWatch,My friend (15F) is going to kill herself in less than a month.,"This is a call for help.

I met her at the start of 2019, where she was a transfer who was introduced to our school. She was a very social person and easily became friends with other people, so she had no problem fitting in. Since we had similar classes, she and I got closer and started hanging out together around the middle of the year.

Things seemed normal at the start, but she seemed to always stress very easily and it was clear she wasn’t sleeping well. She often slept at school, and started skipping classes. At first, nobody really assumed anything because she laughed it off and seemed to be pretty happy. Some time passes, and she’s getting visibly worse - crying more frequently, eyebags getting darker, less energy etc.

One day, I noticed cuts on her arm, around late October.  I immediately confronted her about it, and she opened up because we were quite close at that point, but wouldn’t really tell me why she was self harming. Over the weeks, when we had exams/finals, she got much worse - she started cutting much more frequently, on her arms, legs, chest etc. Skipping classes one day, she was caught and sent to the Vice Principals office where she told him about her self harming as an excuse (mistake). After getting sent to the counsellors office, her mum was called to school to pick her up.

On the way home, her mother verbally abused her and talked her down for self harming. She was also referred to a psychiatrist (that she didn’t go to) because her parents never bothered to get her to one - not treating the issue seriously enough being one reason, and the price being another (despite spending thousands a year on tutoring).

When she was younger (around 9 or 10), she was abused by her brother who had anger management issues. He would let out his anger onto her by both physically and emotionally abusing her. Her parents never cared enough to notice, which caused her to suffer for years with this kind of treatment. Even years later, she’s still afraid of her brother, and only talks with him when absolutely necessary.

After her mother found out about her self harming, she became increasingly stressed from having to hide her cuts and box cutters, as well as have to deal with her constant forceful attempts at cornering her into telling her about her self harming. There was no place to escape to either, as she shared a room with her mother and hid in the bathroom to self harm. An incident happened just two weeks ago: her father, mother and older brother had left the house earlier in the day which left her alone to roam and relax freely. When she felt a little hungry, she left her room to get food and was ambushed by her mother who was waiting hidden in another room, thinking she had caught her self harming. This was later followed by her father breaking down the door when she made a makeshift lock. (the lock was the barrel bolt type, and the bolt had been removed). She was forced to wait until either her brother or father came home, so she was sure she was safer. Her mother has been really invasive with her privacy and often did this, as well as going through her belongings whenever she isn’t at home.

She has expressed intentions of suicide multiple times throughout the past month, and I think that she is 100% serious and able to follow through.

Right now, only one other friend and I know most of the story and her intentions, and we don’t know what to do. So far, we have been trying our best through talking to her, getting her to open up more and listening to her when she needs it.

We came to reddit to ask older, more experienced people for advice:

* What are the things we should be doing? and how? The adults around us are untrustworthy and she won’t open up to her therapist. (and it’s very unlikely that she would ever)
* What should we say to her to change her perspective on things maybe?
* Since we already know that she’s going to (most likely) commit suicide, what can we do to help prevent it?

Sorry this is a bit of a long read, but this is a basic summary of what my friend and I know. As far as we know, there isn’t anything else to tell. Feel free to ask anything to clarify and I will do my best to answer with what I know.

&#x200B;

 

**Edit**

Thank you so much for all the advice and responses. My friend and I have talked it through and, I called the suicide hotline. After explaining the situation, the person told me that the best and most I could probably do is to keep supporting and being there for her. If it really comes down to it, we are prepared to call the police.

To clarify some things:

Whether we want to or not, it’s not likely we can get in contact with school anytime soon given that school starts at the end of the month and there’s three weeks to the end of the holidays. As far as I know, all the adults around me would rather I stay away rather than help which is why I asked for their help. All of our parents are quite strict as well, she’d gotten away with sleeping over at a friends place twice after running away, then calling after to tell them where she was. And when she got home, she was yelled at for a long time.

I’ve been trying to take her out as much as possible this holiday, and continue to make plans with her, keeping in mind all the advice you’ve given us. I might post again in the future, hopefully for the recovery and healing of her mental health. Thank you so much for all the support you’ve given me, and I hope this turns out well for everyone."
dxx4se,SuicideWatch,Reddit was the best and worst thing I have discovered,"It all started with studying for the SAT, I created a reddit account to join r/sat to get extra resources and help. 

But then I discovered other communities of reddit...until I dawned upon r/suicidewatch. I spend hours on this sub. I’m so entranced by the resilience of others and what they have overcame thus far. But more selfishly I’m addicted to being heard. I’m addicted to voicing my sadness, my anger, my guilt etc. I love how ppl response and I love how ppl care. I crave this feeling real life but I know this fantasy will never be realized. 

However, this has proved catastrophic for me. I spend so much time on this sub and neglect all my other responsibilities."
cihid7,SuicideWatch,"I did it.... (Trigger Warning: Suicidal Ideation, Suicidal Gestures, Hospitalization)","TLDR at End

I have been passively suicidal for some time. Lately, it had become more active; I was making suicidal gestures nightly as a coping skill to deal with my depression, anxiety, and burnout due to the amount of stress I was under. 

Last Monday night, I took it a step further and tried to end my life by strangulation. I obviously failed, but I felt strange... unfulfilled? I didn’t sleep that night; I just cried. 

Tuesday I went into work and we were testing the fire alarms while I was training new employees. I just got this sudden, overpowering urge to kill myself because of the stress and noise and my disappointment in myself for the previous night’s failure. I also got a snap of lucidity. I blurted out to my office manager “I need to go to the hospital” and left work. 

When I got to the ER, and was standing at the front desk, the triage nurse asked me what brought me in. I looked at her and just said “I am having a mental breakdown” and started sobbing uncontrollably. They immediately brought me back to the safe observation room, had me do a urine screen and drew some of my dehydrated blood. They had me strip and put me in safety clothes (paper patient scrubs) and the ER doc came and interviewed me first. 

The ER doc decided I needed a psych evaluation, which lead to a psych nurse basically asking me questions about what was going on. At some point she asked my observer to get me some tissues, and I just started laughing. Uncontrollably. The nurse looked troubled by this. She asked if that was normal for me and I said yes, especially when I was really stressed and anxious. 

She started to explain that the hospital had two programs for psych emergency treatment; full or partial hospitalization. It was her job to advise the doctor on which treatment I should receive. She told me that she decided they were going to place me in full hospitalization. I asked if I had a choice in this matter and she just said “No, as of this moment we have a court order for your involuntary admission to the psych unit on a 72 hour hold. We are just waiting for the unit transfer to go through.”

I just kind of chuckled and said “that’s fair.”

The three days went by slowly. No tech, no outside contact. Just treatment groups (I painted a recipe box, drew a picture of a tree, learnt about the anger cycle and learnt waaaay too much about myself), mealtimes (we got a choice of what we wanted, within reason... and no sharp edges), and meeting with doctors, social workers and your assigned nurse. 

At the end of my involuntary hold, they asked if I was ready to be discharged from inpatient, and I said yes. 4 hours later I was released to the world, but not fully from the hospital. I was placed in partial hospitalization: weekdays I have to check into the program at 7:30, and get out at 3. They are further refining my meds as well as having me attend group therapy and occupational therapies and such. I have my first full day of PHP on Monday. 

I always avoided seeking help. When I went to the hospital, I had truly given up. They were nothing but nice to me, and being cared for gave me hope for the future. 

If you feel suicidal or self harmful, it can be hard and scary to go to the hospital. The cost can seem prohibitive. The social stigma can be repulsive. Admitting you need help can seem impossible. 

I’m not paying for my hospitalization or PHP; the hospital has a grant program if your earned income is below a certain threshold. No one knows why you are there (or if you even are there) unless you tell them or give the staff permission. And if you are on this board... you have already admitted you need help. 

I have learnt a lot the past several days. I entered with an open heart and nothing to loose, and grew because of it. Please, consider going to the hospital. 

TLDR: Tried suicide for the hundredth time, had mental breakdown, admitted myself to the hospital, got better."

bbifi2,SuicideWatch,I tried to hang myself tonight,"Self-explanatory.  The rope wasn't long enough, I couldn't make a secure knot over the light fixture. I kicked the chair, felt the pull on my neck and it immediately came loose and I fell on my back. Got right back up and tried again, same thing. I can't do anything right. I wish it had worked. I'm so tired. I'm tired of myself. I'm tired of my shitty artistic projects that go nowhere and don't amount to anything. I'm tired of my job. I'm tired of school. I'm tired of everyone treating me like I'm not a human being or I'm invisible. I'm tired of the citizens bank atm that never works. I'm tired of feeling like a disappointment to everyone.  I'm tired of all of the thoughts I can't stop and the emotional trauma I'm going through. It just keeps getting worse and worse and I just want it to end.  The person I love the most continuously treats me like nothing.  I tried to stop drinking and cutting and everything's just gotten worse.  Things keep setting me off and I don't know how much longer I can keep this up. I'm going to buy a longer length of rope tomorrow.  I feel like everyone would be better off if I was dead and everyone would love me more. Everyone loves someone more when they're dead and I don't feel like anyone does now and its all I want.  I know everyone will move on and be fine and I'm tired of being a disappointment and a burden.   I can't even talk about what's driving me the most with anyone because it makes me feel ashamed and humiliated. Its never going to stop. God I just wish it had worked tonight.

cp6tbv,SuicideWatch,Going to leave my suicide letter here,"I only have ever wanted to feel love.  I’ve always wanted to be loved.  But I struggle to feel connected to people, I struggle to believe that anyone in my life loves me.  I’m deeply convinced that nobody does.  

If there’s anything that I’ve learned in life, it’s that people can really fucking leave you.  And I could never understand why.  But “love” has always been conditional - be good, behave, don’t let your sadness show - and only then you’ll be loved.  It’s my fault people leave.  I always do something to mess it up.  Because I’ve never understood how to relate to others.  

People have told me I’m too difficult to love.  People have left me after seeing how sad and anxious I really get.  I’ve been told my entire life that my body is not okay and not worthy of being seen.  

I’ll never forget the therapist that ruined my life forever.  He diagnosed me, looked me right in the eyes, and told me I’d never have normal relationships ever again.  My life felt like it ended that day.  I was fifteen.  I’ve never been the same since.  Since then, I’ve felt like I was born wrong.  My entire existence was a mistake.  I was inherently beyond repair.  Nobody would ever love me again.  

Rejection.  Over and over again.  

I’m not worth being loved.  I’m not worth anyone’s time.  I don’t deserve safety or comfort.  

I feel empty.  I can’t see any life in my own eyes anymore.

I’ve hung on as long as I could in the hopes that someone would just stay with me.  I’ve bargained with myself, I’ve said well, if no one can love me, I’ll let someone abuse me if it meant they just stayed in my life.

And now, I’m almost 29, and I am truly alone.  I have no one I can talk to.  No one that knows just how dark it really gets sometimes.  I feel connected to no one.  I don’t feel safe around anyone.  Friendships feel superficial.  Dating and relationships are far too difficult.  Sex doesn’t feel good.  Companionship seems impossible.  

I don’t have anyone.

Maybe there are some people in the world that are just kind of meant to be discarded and forgotten about.  Maybe I’m one of those people, even though I’ve tried to make something of myself.

I just wanted to be loved.  That’s all.  I just wanted to know what love feels like so bad.

My therapist was really my last hope that maybe someone could stay in my life.  That maybe someone liked me.  I haven’t been able to cope without her.  Now that she’s out of my life, I truly am alone.  I don’t have anyone I feel like I can depend on anymore.  No one that supports me.  No one I can talk to.

Honestly, in my wildest fantasies, I just wanted someone to hold me and tell me they love me.  Tell me I’m a good kid.  That I’m doing a good job.  That I’m a sweet boy.  That I’m lovable.  That they will stay with me.  That I’m good enough.  That my body is okay and nothing is wrong with it.  That I don’t need to work so hard to get people to like me.  I wish someone could just look at me and tell me I’m okay exactly as I am.   

Being good enough is really one of my wildest dreams.  As long as I can remember, I’ve never been good enough and I always put in so much effort to make up for it in other ways.  But it’s exhausting now.  I’m tired. 

I don’t want to do this, but I know I have to.  After my body is found and I’m confirmed dead, I’d like to be cremated.  All of my belongings can be discarded.  My cats can go to loving homes - I’m hoping maybe people I know.  My social media can be taken down.  I imagine work and life will go on as normal.  

If my body is found and I’m not dead - I do not want to be on life support, I do not want to be resuscitated, I don’t want to be in any kind of vegetative state.  I do not want any type of end of life care.  I want to be euthanized as quickly as possible.  Under no circumstances do I want to be kept alive.  

I’m sorry.  I just wanted to know what love felt like."
gjujjd,SuicideWatch,Passive Suicidal Ideation,"I have passive suicidal thoughts at least semi regularly. The best way I can describe it is like standing in front of a firing squad waiting and wanting them to pull the trigger but they never do. I don't know if anyone else can relate to that description.

EDIT: Wow, I wasn't expecting so many replies. Not that I thought I was alone in thinking this way but it's comforting to know there's people in similar situations.

fz7iza,SuicideWatch,Stuck in the house with my rapist.,"As title says. Lockdown has me stuck 24/7 in the same house as my brother, who raped me over the course of 3 years when I was a kid. Usually I have work, friends, boyfriend, places to go, things to do that keep me away from here as least some of the time. But all I hear when I wake up and when I go to sleep is his laughter, laughter that should have been mine. He's disabled, so everyone ignores what he did, as if it somehow means it doesn't hurt me because ""he wasn't *trying* to hurt you."" But he DID. I look back at my life and wonder just how much he took from me and how much more he will continue to take. What's the point in continuing on if I'm just going to lose so much before it even has a chance to happen? I'll never marry, because I'll never be able to find someone willing and able to suffer through my mood swings, my depression, my complete lack of emotional control. I'm already 99% sure my bf is readying himself to end it. I'll never achieve my dreams because I lack the drive to do anything constructive for myself. I'll keep pushing people away because I'm so afraid they'll hurt me. What's the point in living in a world where people want you so little, they'll defend and protect your rapist? All I ever wanted was someone to come along who would be angry for me. Who would show me that this was not what I deserved and introduce me to peace and maybe justice. But all anyone has ever done is pull a curtain over it and tell me not to look. But it's there, it's always there and it always will be. People always tell us assault victims that we're ""survivors"" but I don't want to ""survive"". I want to live. But I don't think I ever will."

It gets to the point where my feet are made of lead and I can’t even walk anymore. I can’t even stay still, I just want to lay on the concrete and let people step on me, whatever. 

It’s like there’s this anchor and it’s dragging me down and I just want to slip under because all my life I’ve been falling and I’ve finally gotten to the place where I can’t climb back out.

ejtios,SuicideWatch,How do you convince yourself to continue living when it just seems much easier if you kill your self because your life isn’t going to be any better how hard you try and the trauma will not disappear.,
hvee7k,SuicideWatch,Why can't I just shut up???,Why do I always say the wrong thing? Why do I always speak before I think? WHY? I am a piece of shit. I just can never shut up when it would be the best thing to do. I hate myself.
jbsaxl,SuicideWatch,What's the point in therapy if you can't be honest?,"I fucked up today big time. I told my therapist about how I almost attempted suicide but decided not to go through with it. I usually try to be as honest as possible with her and make sure I tell her everything that's going on because they can't really help you otherwise. But what I didn't realize is that if you tell them about plans or attempts to kill yourself, they have to hospitalize you.

Luckily I was able to convince her that I was doing better (I'm not) and she decided she would let me off the hook this time if I made a psychiatrist appointment and got on medication. I'm really upset about this though because it means now I have to start lying to my therapist. I don't want to get sent to a psych ward, I know it would do a lot more harm than good. So I'm just going to have to keep all my suicidal thoughts to myself from now on.

It's such a shame how the mental health system is set up. She was the one person I could talk to and trust, and now I don't even have that."

Each day is just going through the motions. It's not like I actually enjoy anything, havent been happy in years. Seeing all my friends succeed and excel in the same things I'm struggling to do on a fundamental level just kinda sucks. Being alive has no redeeming qualities. If you're reading a book or watching a movie you dont like, you stop. Why should life be any different? 

Why bother being alive"
d58bjz,SuicideWatch,I participated in a suicide prevention walk yesterday and it made me feel more suicidal,"I hoped that participating in this walk would give me hope, and help me see how much suicide impacts the lives of the people left behind. Instead, I felt miserable. Everyone was writing messages for people they've lost to suicide and hanging them up for everyone to see. I feel so incredibly screwed up saying this, but as I read the messages, I was envious of the people they wrote about. I was jealous they had the guts to go through with it because I know I don't. This is my first time saying this out loud, because I am so fearful of being judged, but it feels good to get it off my chest."
d4un53,SuicideWatch,I wish I could trade places with kids that are actually abused.,"Because, then, I’d actually have a real excuse as to why I’m like this. I wish my family didn’t love me. I wish they’d beat me. I wish I was raped. I wish I could take the place of every actually abused kid, because they don’t deserve to be hurt. 

My mom is so loving it makes me feel terrible. When she gets me donuts in the morning. When she brings me breakfast and I don’t do shit for her. My grandfather, whom I live with, is working his ass off most nights, and yet I can’t even be bothered to pick up the trash I leave around the house, or go outside to help him with groceries. 

Maybe it’s my mental illness talking, but I genuinely hate how I am. How everything I do is selfish and how uncaring and unhelpful I am. 

A few months ago, I was practically begging my mom to take her anger out on me, to beat me, because I wanted an excuse to be depressed. I wanted to be traumatized, like she was from her own past. 

They buy me so many electronics I shouldn’t even have. I’ve dropped out of school, and when I was in school I’d missed so many days a school councelor visited my home. I’d ran away so many times, worrying them until their worry turned to anger. 

They’ve given me everything, and yet I’m so ungrateful."

dbasqa,SuicideWatch,It's So Hard to Find Meaning After Rock Bottom...,"In the last 6 years I lost my mother to a sudden illness (amyloidosis) married the love of my life, found a successful career with a sweet company car, bought a house, succumbed to alcoholism, attempted suicide, lost my father to alcoholic dementia, lost my my wife, car, house and my job.  I was sober for about 8 months but have been struggling for the last 4 months, jobless in a town without anyone but my 97 year old grandmother.  

I've been hiding my relapse from everyone.  

I flipped out on a friend on Facebook and said something that really turned the knife in me.  He spewed off all his accomplishments -- owner of two companies, wife and 4 kids, head of three community boards, two houses and then said, ""And what about you?  Are you even recovered?""

But honestly, what does all those things even mean?  Do they matter?  Do I matter?  Does it really matter to anyone if I recover?  The stigma is so terrible with addiction that the first thing he went for was that.  He was right, but that just reinforces that addicts are the scum of the earth, and I'm one of them.

So is it really worth it?  We're on an over populated planet with people fighting for their piece of the pie.  Do I deserve anything?"
bu8clv,SuicideWatch,The only thing keeping me alive is the fear that I’ll survive,"I’m afraid that I’ll survive and become physically deformed and mentally handicapped.

I'm more lonely then ever before, the last few friends have left me and now only my family remains.
Not hurting them kept me going for years, but that isn't living. Being in pain every single day just to save them the pain of losing me. No more, it has to end. My best, and last, friend gave up on me a week ago and I haven't talked to a single person since.

gl3phu,SuicideWatch,I've stopped thinking about suicide,"It started when i was 12, crying in my room alone every night, writing down why i wanted to die and how life was meaningless. I've been in this state of mind during too many years. 

At first i thought being normal would give me hapiness. So i took care of myself, i discovered sex and social activites in highschool, i discoverded frienship and for a time i really thought this was my purpose, that being average was good and that i was happy. I used to be socially akward and never talk to girls, never go out or talk to anyone. I was living in my imagination, escaping reality with virtual worlds where i was free 

And here i am,  21 yo, i just gave up my garbage engineering school . I want more, i want to fight, figthing for girls and being cool was futile, i want to succeed. I m working hard my maths and physics to get a better school next year. I was blind, but now i can finally see the beauty  behind the maths, the meaning of it. 

We are just animals, everything we do is useless. We are nothing, with the body and the mind of an ape. So we need to give everything we can to keep this body in a good state. I was an alcooholic and drug addict, i only lived in false worlds. I'm done now, no more suicidal thoughts, no more bullshit. 

I realized i was addicted to video games, my phone, music, parties, sex and other drugs. This helped me a lot in my evolution, getting away from these things saved me. I hope it will help you too

edt8bq,SuicideWatch,"""Why don't you get a girlfriend?""","What the fuck.

What the actual fuck.

HOW THE FUCK CAN YOU BE SO FUCKING CASUAL ABOUT THIS?

I've heard this from counselors. I've heard this from therapists. The cocksucking psychiatrist who diagnosed me with PTSD, MDD and BPD (""borderline traits"") told me this.

How the actual fuck can people be so fucking casual about a romantic relationship?

Do y'all mfs just think I can go to Amazon and order one?

I- I don't get it. I don't get it.  I DON'T FUCKING GET IT. WHAT THE FUCK.

LIKE I'M SUPPOSED TO JUST GO UP TO A GIRL I LIKE AND SAY ""hey i like u let's date because my psychiatrist said so"" FUCK YOU YOU TRIVIALISING PIECES OF HUMAN TRASH.

fuck you.

fuck you for telling an ugly fat incel to go get a girlfriend like it's no big deal.

fuck you for treating the idea of a girl's love like it means nothing.

and fuck you fuck you fuck you for even trying to tell me that there's any chance in the fucking world that a girl can like anything about me, because i can guaran-fucking-tee you that in the 5 years since i first went on meds, since i first went to therapy, after all the working out and hospitalizations, I've only become worse.

Fuck you for not listening to me and gaslighting me whenever I say I'm unlovable you fucking ""professionals"". 

Fuck you for not taking me seriously when I literally carved the word ""unlovable"" all over my body.

Fuck you for trivialising and reducing love down to nothing.

Because guess what you fucking sorry excuse of a mental health system, some of us don't get love or kindness just because we need it. 

I didn't go to you just because I saw and experienced a lifetime of emotional, mental, physical and sexual abuse. I didn't go to you just because I was and still am constantly bullied for the way I look and act. 

No one will ever fucking love me for any part of what I am or do, and your amazing lack of sympathy and downright intolerance for that fact, the kind of intolerance that lead you to actually get angry at me at even suggesting the idea that girls don't like fat, ugly guys, you fucking ""professional"", it's truly incredible. Leaving meds and help behind didn't make my life better, but it's really amazing how little leaving medical help behind affected me; life was and is getting worse, I was and am and will be unlovable, I should've and need to kill myself as soon as fucking possible


So stop treating girlfriends like it's just another pill you can prescribe. Not only is it not a poor girl's job to ""fix"" me or handle the burden of my bullshit, it's certainly not your right to tell me to find love when I'm SITTING AT YOUR FUCKING DESK BECAUSE LOVE AND KINDNESS WON'T EVER BE A PART OF MY LIFE YOU IGNORANT FUCK I HOPE SOMEONE FORCES YOU TO EAT THE CURB MAY YOUR JAW TURN TO ASHES"
k3agk9,SuicideWatch,Why can’t it be me?!!!!? Whyyyyy,A man was killed on a motorcycle today. I went through the same intersection last night 50km over the limit the night before on a yellow. Why can’t it be me. And he could be safe today. Go back to his family. Maybe even wife or girlfriend. Why can’t I take his place. I would swop in a heartbeat with him
fnpjco,SuicideWatch,I haven't been okay for a long time. I'm only alive because I don't know how to die.,"They say you shouldn't bottle up your feelings. They say honesty is the best policy. They're right of course. But that doesn't mean what should be done is the same as what can be done.

I fucked up. Not in a huge way. Not in a way that affects anyone but me in the long term. I'm a lazy asshole. Am I escaping? Am I hiding? And I distracting myself? Doesn't matter. I was supposed to be working. I wasn't. I got reprimanded. And I'm taking it hard despite the fact everyone is having a fantastic fucking day today.

So here I am, in tears because I take criticism and being called out on my bullshit too personally. I don't want to die. Dieing hurts. Dieing hurts people who give a fuck about you for whatever reason. Dieing is complicated. I want to have never existed. Then no one would hurt.

I want to tell people I'm hurt. But it's not their problem. I want to tell people I'm not okay. But who am I to ruin a perfectly good day? People get so upset when you tell them things that suck. I don't want to make anyone upset. So I go through one day where I'm in pain. Then two days. Then a week, a month, two months... I feel like if I just wait and stay quiet, things will get better, like a toothache you ignore until you don't notice it anymore. Why bother a friend when I can just wait? Eventually the pain leaves and no one is hurt by the end.

But this pain isn't ending. I don't think the pain ever ended before either. New pain digs up the old pain. But I'm not about to ruin anyone's day. I'm not about to complain. My problems are mine. Who am I to foist my problems in someone else who's job isn't to deal with my shit?

That's exactly what it is: shit! What good is shit? What good is a person who has nothing but shit? I want to have never existed. Death seems like the next best thing. But I live in a place with no access to it. No tall bridges. No tall buildings. I'd take pills, but that's not a guarantee. I'd shoot myself with my husband's gun, but I don't want him to get in trouble. I'm too squeamish to open my veins. I don't know how to end this. If I did, I would have left earth months ago.

Just because I'm here doesn't mean I'm okay.

I am so hopelessly ugly that it's 100% guaranteed I will never have a girlfriend. This Is not a body image issue, it's just a issue of my bad face. And I'm a guy. I'm 5'8"" and not growing anymore too, just to make things worse.

I've never done anything at all with my life, just simpering to my abusive mom who will just take my phone for ever disagreeing with her. I am never happy anymore at all. Just more misery every day.

I also have Irritable Bowel Syndrome which means extreme cramping every single day of my life and complete dependence on having a toilet nearby.

My parents forced me into isolation by homeschooling me until this year (9th grade). Which means I have zero social skills. I don't even have the building blocks for social skills. I've never been to a party or even gone to anyone else's house, until this year at 14 I had never even talked to another person under 18. 

I wasn't even allowed to play games as a kid, I was forced to do extreme academic work and do nothing but school and sleep. My parents were both extreme nerds with 130 IQs, neither of who wanted me, my mom just had me to spare her 9 months of endometriosis pain (she admits this is why she had me). 

I just don't care any more, my 15th birthday is Friday which means I can spend it alone in my room like any other day, after a miserable day of final exams on my birthday. Final exams that will result in punishment if I don't get A+, in my family I'm told I'm an idiot who needs tutoring if I get an A not an A+. B's are grounds for punishment. No, I'm not Asian.

I just wish I had someone to be with or something to do, all I do is make people uncomfortable. Some people are nice to me but only out of obligation and kindness, not because they actually like me.

Nothing will change when I get older. I'll still be disgusting and will die a virgin, if I get to be 18 I'll just be an i*cel. 

And even if I get a good job or have any academic success, it's all pointless, nobody likes me and I enjoy absolutely nothing. 

I want to die, a lot. But I'm also afraid that there's no afterlife and it's going to be a black void. That's as much a possibility as heaven or hell. I really don't want to be lonely for all eternity."

When the day came, I was still low enough to go through with it. I was set on it. However, during last period, he said something. He said he wanted to commit the act of falling on a sword (don't remember the word). He's suicidal as well, as well as most of my friends, so suicide jokes are common. What stopped me was what he said after. He said he would've done it already if it weren't for me. This changed my view instantly, and I didn't do it. It made me feel needed, and not completely worthless. The day after that day was actually a bit better, and it stayed a bit better. I haven't been that low since. It's still hard to deal with, but it's more bearable now. If I had actually done it, I would most likely be dead right now. I could never thank him enough, but I'll never be able to tell him.

Nobody knows who I am. I haven't had a friend in years. I don't remember what friendship was like. When I talk to people, something always feels off, as if I'm speaking a different language or something. I just want someone to know me. It's so lonely and cold and empty and I just want to scream so loud that I hurt myself.
I was born in Alabama. I was an accident, my dad was and still is a meth addict. My mom is great and has raised me all these years. She left my real dad when his addiction got too bad. I was about 2 or 3, maybe younger. We moved to a new town, she met a new guy. My step dad. He was good at first. We moved to Texas for his new job, he broke. 
Something in his changed. He became abusive. He didn't hit me, and he only hit my mom once, but he was verbally and emotionally abusive. She was with him from when I was in first grade to fifth grade. 
He started storing food and water in his room. Note, his room. My mom slept in my room with me because she hated him. He thought we were going to poison him. 
Both him and my mom became alcoholics during this time, and would drink bottles of wine and then scream at each other all night.
Even though I was going through this, those were the happiest years of my life. Or maybe I'm just looking back with rose tinted glasses. At school I had so many friends and everyone liked me. Everyone though I was funny. 
In fifth grade my depression and anxiety started. I started to realize I was fatter then my friends and it hurt to think about. They started making fun of me for wearing undershirts instead of bras.
 My best friend was a boy named Ben. I loved him and I still do. I think about him a lot. His dad forced him to stop being my friend because it was ""gay"" to be a close friend with a girl. He pushed me away and now he's gone. 
I got chosen to do a speech at my school assembly because everyone liked me. It was for a pep rally. I was supposed to announce the winner of the fundraiser or some shit like that. They changed it at the last second, had some random old guy who donated to the school announce it instead. So they made me go up there with no plan and just wing it. I froze and everyone laughed at me. Or maybe they didn't, I don't know what's real and what's my anxiety imagining things anymore. 
I started lying a lot around this time too. Not to my parents, by to everyone else. I made up elaborate fake lives, I still do. They're nothing special, just, different.
My mom divorced my step dad in fifth grade. I had to keep visiting him for a while. He had completely lost it by then and would probably have killed us both if we hadn't left. One time I was at his house, my old house, and tried to run away because I was scared of him. He caught me and called the police on me. I don't know why. My neighbors were watching and called my mom. They were good people. 
The policeman got there and said I was lying. He told me my mom was putting all the thoughts of abuse in my head. Then, he forced me to hug my step dad while I screamed and cried in fear. That memory is one of the worst ones I have. He left, and I had to stay at my dads house still. 
He blackmailed my mom into giving him everything. The money, the car, the house, my dog. Just out of spite. I miss her. Her name was ginger. She'd probably be around 10 years old right now if she is still alive. I don't know if she is. I miss her even after all this time. We packed everything into a cheap car and moved back to Alabama. I lost everything. 
I started to realize I was different in middle school. I did weird things, I acted weird. I would touch other people's hair becuase I liked the way it looked. I still acted like a very young child even at 11. Don't know why. I didn't have a single friend in 6th grade. 
In 7th grade, I became truly depressed. I did ha e someone though. Her name was Mary. She's gone now too.
In 8th grade, I had a bigger group of friends. Everyone still thought I was weird though. I still did weird things, dressed weird too. I know there's probably something wrong with me but my mom is too scared to take me to a doctor to get diagnosed. She thinks medicine is bad. Pills specifically. That's why I'm not allowed any anti depressants either. 
When highschool started, my social anxiety was so bad that I started homeschooling. The homeschooling laws are so lax in Alabama that I barely did anything except play the sims all day. 
In 10th grade, we became poor. Lost the car, lost everything almost. She got a new job in Ohio, we moved again. I lost all of my friends again.
I homeschooled at first, then started going to the local highschool. I thought everything had changed, that I could be normal. It was hell. Everyone hated me. My favorite memory is when I walked into a room to get something, only to hear ""does she seriously dress like that? Wow."". It hurt. We were still pretty poor and I was doing the best I could. All of my clothes were from goodwill. There was one guy there who was nice to me. His name was evan. I hope he has a good life, he was one of the best people I've ever met.
Luckily I'm kind of smart and got into a program that let me start college early, so for 11th grade that's what I've been doing. It's so lonely. It's so fucking lonely I just want to scream and scream and scream but I can't. I've never know what it's like to be in love with someone who loves you. I've never kissed anyone or even held hands or anything close. I feel so fat and ugly all of the time even when people tell me I'm not. I posted on amiugly and everyone said I was pretty, I thought it would help but it didn't. 
I've become very paranoid. I'm scared all of the time that people are out to get me, that my life is a simulation, that I'm dead. I talk to myself. Either comforting words telling myself it's ok or long spiraling sentences about what a disgusting fat cunt I am. I'm scared.
I told my mom about the depression, and the anxiety. She doesn't know I'm suicidal. That I've been planning out what best way to end it for months. I can't go to therapy. There's a huge scholarship learning abroad program I'm signing up for and they won't let me go if I'm a fucking loon. 
So I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. The only reason I haven't ended it is because I want someone to remember me, to mourn me, other than my mom. 
I have a sister. I only found out about her when I was 11ish. She's my half sister in my dads side. I don't know how old she is anymore. I was so happy to meet her. It was so good to have a sibling. I felt like I had a real family. She left for college and immediately stopped talking to me. I haven't heard from her in years. The last thing she texted me was a happy birthday text a few years ago. I miss her. She was good. 
Her and my dad won't even know I'm dead. My last birthday was sad. I had been planning out my sweet 16 for years. I didn't have any birthday parties for years because I wanted to have one big one. When it finally came around, I didn't have anybody to invite. It was just me and my mom. I ate some cake, opened my presents, and played video games. Not terrible at all, but not what I had been dreaming of since childhood.
I'm supposed to turn 17 next month. March the 20th. Please remember me. Please if you have the time, read my story. You'll be the only people to know it except for me. I hope you remember me. I just want someone to know me again. It's so cold being alone.

Goodbye
-mimi 


Edit: 
I didn't think people would care this much. The support I have received from all of you is legitimately amazing. So, thank you. I think I'm going to try and get some help, even if I have to put my studies on hold. Im trying to reply to everyone, sorry that it's taking so long.

See you later

kt3u41,SuicideWatch,I Want To Tell Somebody I'm Wanting To Kill Myself But I Don't Want To Be Admitted To A Mental Hospital,"I'm sitting in class right now trying to keep my tears from bursting out from my eyes. I failed all of my classes last semester and the counselor yesterday told me she's wanting me to transfer to this school for bad kids so I can get my credit recovered. I really want to go tell that same person I'm wanting to kill myself but I know she'll admit me to a mental hospital. I've been to one once already, and I never want to go again. I literally feel like I've let down my whole family. My mother is the most disappointed in me and I know she'll be better off without me. Oh god, this is so hard to type. Tears are starting to come out and I don't want my peers seeing it. I've tried so hard. I really did. I can't keep living after I failed all of my classes and now I probably won't graduate and won't be able to get a job. I'm probably going to talk to my counselor but I'm so fucking scared to confess this to anyone because I'll be sent to a mental hospital which didn't help me last time. I feel like I need a mental break from school but I know the school probably won't allow that. Somebody please give me advice on what to do.

&#x200B;

Edit: Thank you guys for all of the support. My dad had a talk with me that almost shattered my heart. He cried in front of me saying how he's scared for my future but he stated multiple times that he wasn't mad at me, just worried and because of that he loves me. He will help me get through this. My mother on the other hand will probably just yell at me and tell me stuff I've heard before. She hasn't talked to me for like 2 days. Anyways, my dad motivated me to get good grades. This new school that I'm going to may be bad, but the work will be way less harder than it needs to be (my current school is for people that are super smart, and I for one, am not)."
j5jotm,SuicideWatch,I just want to be normal but clearly that's not possible so I'm just gonna kill myself instead,"I don't understand what's wrong with me I just wanna be normal and I don't believe in God but if there is any god, fuck you."
imgbop,SuicideWatch,After six months of therapy and taking antidepressants I can happily announce...,that i still feel like shit and therapy is useless and everything is pretty hopeless in general
j001gg,SuicideWatch,people only realize that you needed help when you’re dead,
fwr2nm,SuicideWatch,Anyone else ever fantasise about their own death and funeral?,"I sometimes find myself fantasising about my own death, like picturing how I'd die, whether it's from suicide or even some tragic accident. I imagine what my funeral would be like, all my friend's and family being upset and devastated about my death. I wonder who would actually be upset and how much they cared about me. It kinda makes me want to do it even more tbh, it makes me feel something that I can't really explain.

I just want to know if anyone else gets this?"
cq7a8m,SuicideWatch,I'm gonna probably attempt to kill myself sometime during college,"For so many years I've been putting it off, because people have been telling me ""no dont die"" and hobbies keeping me from doing it but looking on how I've reacted to and treated people, my sensitivity towards everything, I'm going to kill myself. 

Even if I were to continue living what's the point? I'm so replaceable, I lack self confidence to the point where I feel awful about letting people down when I mention that I'm sad.

I'm going to do this. Plan and all. Giving the people in my lives a final goodbye before I do it. At least they have a better look on to why I did it. 

Not gonna lie, kinda scared, but hey we all are gonna die anyways so what makes my death any different? I can literally write anything here about how I'm going to end it and no one I know will find it. Not that they would like what I've written. 

I dont care that I have potential. I don't care that I have opportunities. I just want to die after putting it off for so long.

I hope people care less seeing that I'm an adult. Just to see that I'm just another cog in the machine.

Edit: this got a lot of attention wow. Thank you guys so much for the support! Especially right now when I'm gonna start college soon. This has really got me to think about where I'm going with this and I'm gonna try and get it out of my system. Even tho these thoughts might come back, at least I know where to go when they do."
atrk9y,SuicideWatch,"Ever feel like you're the most fucked up person in the world and no matter how much effort you put in, you will always be alone and unloved?",Why is the title so long
exlfl2,SuicideWatch,2020 will be the year i make the change i want to see in the world!! finally gonna kill myself!!,"all jokes aside—i’m just not cut out for this. people tell me all these things that are supposed to be comforting about life and it all makes me want to die more. i don’t want to try to get better, i just want to die. everything is too fucking hard and i am too fucking weak."
9hbq1f,SuicideWatch,I want to go to my therapist just to tell her to fuck off.,"I started seeing a therapist. This lady I actually liked. She told me the next time I wanted to cut myself or really wanted to kill myself, to go to the emergency room. I did that. She told me they would give me attention and medication and really help me. I stayed there over night about 8 hours. A therapist in some other city video chatted me after being there for 8 hours. I had to use a prison toilet - in socks. She said I think you’re stable enough to go home and you’ll be fine just keep seeing your therapist. That’s it. Yesterday I got a bill in the mail for $3,711. For that one night where they did nothing. Nothing. I had to reschedule my appointments this month because I just switched jobs and couldn’t afford my co-pay. I have phenomenal insurance and those fucks charged me $3711? After insurance? For locking me in a room so I could video chat some random bitch that might be a doctor. How pathetic do I feel after begging them for help and they do nothing. A lot of my unnecessary stress is money. Why is it so expensive to get help? Why did it take every therapist over a week just to call me back and set an appointment for me a month in advance? Why does everyone tell you to get help but they never tell you how hard it is? It’s so fucking expensive. Getting a bill in the mail for 4 grand when you’re suicidal doesn’t make you excited to live. I now have a hatred for every person in the medical field cheating people out of their money and their health. Fuck you to those people that send the bills and a big fuck you to my asshole therapist. 

I plan to say these things to her in a kinder tone and ask her why she would recommend that for me. I’m really hurt because I trusted her and it only embarrassed me and made my life worse. I hate myself so much and it made me feel even more worthless. I won’t cuss at her or disrespect her but this is my life. I went to her for help. I needed someone who could really help and now I can’t trust any of them. "
cjonor,SuicideWatch,Being gay and ugly sucks,"I’m so fucking worthless. No one wants me and I’m done trying. I’m gonna kill myself. I hate myself for being ugly. My body dysmorphia has gotten worse recently. I can barely eat anything, and I harm myself a shit ton. I think it’s about time to kill myself."
l8aajh,SuicideWatch,"Not all lives are worth living - mine is a clear testament of that, and so, I have chosen to kill myself :)","Looking back to my childhood up until now, I have always been devastatingly sad. I’m ugly, not good at anything at all (literally) and, I’m not even smart enough to be in Law School. (Which I’m currently in, but I don’t feel like I belong here, and I can’t leave because I’m on student loan) - talking about that loan, I have no idea how that’ll be repaid lol. I suffer from depression and chronic anxiety and being at home for all this time has crippled me severely. 

My parents practically hate me and both of them have their individual lives with other spouses. Have I mentioned I practically raised myself??? 

Also, everyone hates me. Literally everyone. And I don’t blame them. I’m going to lift off this burden from their shoulders.

Because not all lives are worth living. Trust me. - mine being one of them. :)

I should mention that I tried last week and failed but imma try again, I have to succeed this time.
Sometimes it really doesn’t get better. - honestly.

Update: 24 hours later and I am in awe at all the kindness I have received from this post and in my messages. You are all so so kind and I wish nothing but happiness and fulfillment for you. Thank you for your kindness friends. ❤️"
e6xju4,SuicideWatch,Why do I keep going?,"I wake up and wonder, why?  Why do I keep getting up and doing this over and over?  It's the same thing.  Get up, go to work, eat dinner, sleep.. repeat.  Why?  What's the point to any of this?  I didn't ask to be here."

l2ayg7,SuicideWatch,People are just so fucking mean,"If people were fucking kinder, compassionate, not judgemental, half of us wouldn’t even be suicidal right now. 

How is it that people are/can be such cunts to other humans?! Even fucking family?! 

I wouldn’t even want to die in a nice peaceful world but with abusive cunts everywhere and being abused whether it’s verbal or physical there’s so much one can take but shouldn’t have to in the first place

Don’t know how much longer I can deal

I’ve been in this sub for 2 years now but it’s my first crisis post

People are just mean everywhere I fucking turn and go and to top it off, FAMILY, which is supposed to ‘be there for you’ and ‘love you’ doesn’t even acknowledge my medical issues like anxiety and ADHD and thinks and says I’m lazy and make it all up so won’t even help financially although they’re well off

So done right now, think in a week or two I’m leaving, unless they push me even quicker"

da4i2h,SuicideWatch,My cousin/roommate assaulted me last night.. nobody believes me..,"My cousin(roommate) assaulted me last night... nobody believes me...

I moved in with my cousin two weeks ago.. since then he’s been overly loving. He will wake you up and talk to you all day. Literally, the first day there he talked to me for 9 hours straight... even when I went to the bathroom. I have a problem getting black out drunk and he brags about kissing me, watching me in the shower, watching me in the restroom, seeing me naked, I know it’s forced because I don’t like physical contact and I’m asexual that he forces me to cuddle with him when I’m blacked out and don’t remember. He found my phone and has my boyfriends number, best friends number, family’s number and he texts them all day about me and everything I do.. right now I’m having trouble with auditory hallucinations that my family know about, but I’m fixing. My cousin also always talks about raising me and always being a big brother to me... when I’ve seen him 2 times since I was 10 years old...

We have another roommate. My best friend of 7 years. He was in the room and it was 2am. We’d been talking to my cousin literally all day, because we never get a second alone together. My cousin had been drinking all night and refused to go to bed because he wanted to be there when my boyfriend got home so he could “chat” with him about me. But he was so drunk he kept forgetting my boyfriend wasn’t coming over. Finally I asked him if my best friend and I could have some time to talk alone. And he FLIPPED. He began screaming at us that we hate him. Why can’t he hear what I was going to talk about. We’re just conspiring against him.

He ran over to me. Held my arms against my chest so hard that my ribs have bruises, got literally so close to my face he was touching me... and screamed over and over about how he could hurt me so badly and that I don’t know who I’m talking to. He believes he can read minds and see “auras” and said he knows I’m lying. He’s screaming he’s going to beat the shit out of me. I kept telling him to just do it. And then he grabbed my face so fucking hard. And told me to try him. I then yelled that my dad owns this house. And that I was going to tell my boyfriend. And he got scared and backed off. 

Immediately he began texting me about how much he loves me... I left the house and ran down the street to my dads house sobbing. Iv told my mom... my sister.. my dad... everyone believes I was hallucinating.. they said my best friend will say whatever I want him to so his word doesn’t matter.. but he hurt me.. only my boyfriend believes me... I feel so alone.. 

Iv been having flashbacks to my first rape all day.. to my dad beating me as a kid and everyone denying it ever happened.. I’m covered in bruises.. and I wish I was dead.. I just want someone to believe me..."
8t5dsu,SuicideWatch,"Do you ever just sit in bed alone, and realize that no one would notice you missing? Everyone cares only after they announce your death.",
80t2gp,SuicideWatch,"Anyone else just living day by day, remembering nothing, thinking about nothing, enjoying very little, and being incredibly lonely, but almost as if it's sort of your own fault? Like you've done this to yourself?","I cannot verbally explain to anyone over a text, or a call, or by any other means how terrible I feel as of this moment. There are too many reasons and too many complicated situations that I would have to explain for anyone to even have the slightest idea of what kind of pain I'm in at this time. 

Maybe I'm being overbearing...

Its almost as if my chest is hurting? I forget everything? I have no drive? I'm going to grow up to be that old man who tells those kids to ""chase their dreams or end up like me."" 

Just kill me. "
clwa0i,SuicideWatch,I think my heart might explode or just stop working from excessive self inflicted heartbreak,"I just....ruin everything. I don’t know how to function. It feels like all of the air in my body is rushing towards my heart and pressing on it and it’s going to burst at any moment and my chest hurts and I want so badly to just dissolve into earth. Why! Why can’t the world just open and swallow me whole! 

I’m the type of person who invades your life and leaves nothing but destruction. I can’t make this work. I think I deserve to feel this pain sometimes, I just wish I could take pain I cause other people away from them and carry that. 

I hate myself."

clm7h0,SuicideWatch,"I'm attracted to children, and now I've lost all will to live.","Ever since I was around 14 I've been attracted to young children. I have felt nothing for women of my age or younger for 15 years now. All throughout my teenage years, I lived with suppressed shame and guilt over my attraction and I was so disgusted by myself. I was afraid of how others would react so I never told anyone and internalized it until adulthood, all while hoping that this would end when I became an adult. When I reached my twenties and my feelings remained the same, the depression that had been building up until then just kind of exploded and I entered a terrible period of my life when I was so depressed and yet I couldn't bring myself to open up to anyone about why. When I looked to the news and online forums, the word 'pedophile' and 'child molester' essentially meant the same thing to any regular person and were all vilified, whether they had acted on their desires or not. This stigma scared me a lot. After a year or so living in the dumps, I was forced by my brother to go to a counselor to receive treatment for depression. I grew quite comfortable around the guy after a few appointments, and being the idiot I am, I thought that it would be alright to tell him since I thought these people were under rules of strict confidentiality. I explained my point of view and made it clear that I didn't act on any of my desires. Still, he immediately told my brother and I was shunned from my entire family, and they made it clear that they never wanted a vile person like me back.

I then fell into even greater depression. I'm ashamed to admit that, in these periods of time, I thought of things such as ""if everybody is going to hate me no matter what, I might as well actually act on these desires and see what happens"". I still clung onto my humanity, and after looking at online resources and essentially giving myself therapy and talking to people online I managed to bring back a little semblance of normalcy to my life. I got a job, I made some friends and while I'm not rich, I could still feed myself without living off of paycheck to paycheck. I was still attracted to children and I was still deathly scared and ashamed, but I internalized it to the point of just living more or less a lie.

I made one particularly good friend from work and I got along well with his family. After knowing him for a few years, I started to think that at least one person I know in real life would understand if I confided to them my darkest secret. It turned out that I'm yet again a idiot and didn't learn anything. A week ago, we were having a few drinks, and I blurted out a bunch of my thoughts and my condition. I was still wary enough to stress that I had no intentions to, and had never harmed a child in any manner and I thought that that would be okay. The thing is, I had met his nieces before when I was having dinner with him before and had even played with them which probably disturbed him. He stopped contacting me, and only called me once out of anger telling me that I had tricked him all this time, that I was a disgusting piece of shit, and that he'd kill me if he ever saw me again. He's presumably told my workplace, and I'm expecting a notice to get fired anytime soon. 

I've lived my entire life riddled with anxiety and depression over the stress of both my condition itself and what would happen if anyone found out. I've been betrayed by even my family completely over this. Nobody understands me at all. The worst thing is, I can't even be angry. It isn't even unreasonable. I pose a tremendous threat to society. I understand that, which is why I fucking hate myself even more for this. At 29, I've lost all connections to anyone I thought cared for me, and now I've lost my will to live. I'm going to hang myself tonight if not earlier. Nobody will even care, so I won't bother writing a proper note.

Thank you to anyone who bothered to read all of this. It just feels kind of refreshing to put my experiences on record like this one last time."
ad41fb,SuicideWatch,My dad killed himself,"He went missing two months ago and we had no idea where he was for that whole time, and then a week ago someone found his body. He'd committed suicide the night he left. He'd been dead the whole fucking time, two months, and nobody knew. I'm not thinking of killing myself, but I don't know what to do. I've been crying for an hour and I feel like I'm going to throw up, just thinking about how dad's not gonna be at my graduation, not gonna see me score my first goal in hockey, not gonna play guitar with me anymore, not gonna do any of that. I don't know what to do. I'm so lost. "
lidypm,SuicideWatch,Can't see myself in the future,"I've been having suicidal ideations these past few months. All I could think about is dying to suicide, and it just feels like I just need that one moment that will really drive me to do it. 

Now that I have accepted that I'm gonna die to suicide someday, it just feels like everything I plan or do are just going to waste, and in turn I just go with the flow with everything else. 

Now everything just feels bland and unrealistic. Like everything just doesn't matter anymore, like being cut off from reality.

Not really dying, but ain't really living either."
giju3t,SuicideWatch,I'm running out of reasons not to kill myself,"I'm not going to kill myself, at least not at this point, but it hurts to live when there's nothing to live for. The only reason I haven't killed myself yet, and the only reason I'm holding back now is because I know it will hurt people around me. But I'm getting sick of staying alive solely so other people can be happy when I know I'm not going to be happy. 

I hate my past, I hate what happened to me, I hate the decisions I made, I hate my body, I hate my personality, I hate the relationships I have, I hate that I have such unattainable dreams, I hate the world I live in, and most of all I hate that either through the laws of the universe or my own weakness I can't change any of this. 

What's the point when there's literally NOTHING I can find in my present or realistically see in my future that will make me happy. I'm not going to kill myself, but I really, really, really want to."
cmwzja,SuicideWatch,She’s gone and so will I soon,"She left today for the army, she’ll be gone a long time for training and then she’ll be gone another 2 years on top of that for her actual job. We had known each other for coming up on to two years and she was the only thing keeping me sane. Those late nights when I was on the verge of suicide she would call me and calm me down until I would fall asleep on the phone with her. Whenever I was feeling extra down she always knew what to say to make me smile. I would’ve been dead a long time ago without her and now that she’s gone I know I won’t make it more than a week. She was the only thing keeping me here and now that she’s gone I know this depression and anxiety are going to get the best of me. I just want to apologize to her for not being strong enough to make it through."
bhrxjl,SuicideWatch,Ever wonder how so many people haven’t killed themselves?,"It boggles my mind that there are so many people that exist on earth and just,,, live. They rlly be out here alive. Like if they feel how I feel , how the fuck haven’t they killed themselves yet? Am I just weak? Am I weak for thinking about suicide? All the time? I just can’t fathom the idea that people can live life and see a reason to go on every day. I google searched “why don’t people kill themselves” and the only hits I got were links related to “why do people kill themselves?”  But that answer is so fucking obvious to me. I need to know why they DONT kill themselves."
b7s66w,SuicideWatch,"A year ago, I promised myself I'd kill myself on the day I graduated college.","It was supposed to be April 28, 2019. Graduation is supposed to be an exciting beginning to the rest of your life, but I don't want anything to do with my future.

I'm not graduating on time anymore, now. I fucked up my last semester thanks to my depression, and I have to withdraw from my classes. But I'm still thinking about killing myself on April 28.

It would be perfect. Ending it all while my classmates are at their commencement ceremony celebrating their achievements. I know I would never amount to anything, regardless of whether or not I make it to my graduation. My depression and anxiety have held me back for my entire life. I've fought and fought but always come up short. It's not worth fighting anymore.

I want to spend the last month of my life doing things I love, or at least the things I used to love before depression grabbed me by the throat and choked the life out of me. I want to finish my album I've been working on for 6 years so I have something to leave behind. I want to spend quality time with my family and friends so they have lots of good memories to look back on once they recover from the initial shock of my death. I want to eat good food, play video games, and snuggle with my dog.

I'm glad I made this decision now. It's given me a contentedness with living that I haven't had for a while. Maybe I'll actually be able to enjoy my last month instead of wallowing in self-hatred and fear of the future.

I wasn't meant to live past 22."

I had a date picked out. My brother found out and told my entire family. Instead of getting me help, they kept me under constant supervision and made me want to end my life even more. That was 7 years ago and now I wish I had just killed myself anyway. Looking back I can think of opportunities I had despite the constant watch. Now I am just too much of a coward to just do it and get it over with.

I haven't accomplished anything in my life. I'm a fucking 25yo loser that can't get ahead. I'm drowning in debt between bills, student loans, credit card debt. I work myself ragged but just barely manage to eke out a living. I have a lot of good qualifications, but I can't even get someone to look at my resume. So I'm stuck in this dead-end job hoping and praying for a way out of this horrible city that I know will never come.

 I'm miserable all the time and just want to die so badly it drives me crazy. At the end of the day though I just end up sitting here staring at a bottle of pills, contemplating it for about an hour, trying to talk myself into it, before finally going to bed so I can get up tomorrow and hate myself all day for not going through with it."

fgq16u,SuicideWatch,Haha help,"Yes, I am suicidal. Yes, I am ""getting help"". Posted on mobile.

 I don't believe in an afterlife or religion. I only believe in the void after death, where my conciousness ends. With that in mind, dying doesn't seem so bad to me, in fact it's very attractive, especially since I can't imagine myself doing anything productive with my life, or getting a good ending. I think that if I die now, I will stop all possibilities of all problems from affecting me and making me upset. I also believe that even if I was happy or successful, none of that would mean anything in the time frame of the life of the planet, much less the universe. With no knowledge of my personal life or my abilities or personality, I feel that nobody will be able to prove to me that I am unjustified in killing myself. I have had many people make the argument ""your family and friends will be sad"". My reasoning is this: in the void, my conciousness, and by extension, my conscience ceases to exist. This means I won't have to worry about any moral issues, including my method of suicide and whoever finds my body or whatever."

I really appreciate your kind comments, but today was another awful day.

A lot of you asked me  to talk about it, so here is more background

 I have to admit, I don't have the courage to kill myself, but I am still hating every minute my life now

My problem is simple. I am sick , not my body , but my mind. I can't fix it, my psychiatrist can't fix it, my psychologist can't fix it. Meds can't fix it neither.

I don't know what to do, I feel like I am impresioned in my own body. This is slowly killing everything nice I had in my life. 

I know you will say, *it's only your mind you can fix it!*. But I am being In this for 10 painful years and there is little to no improvement. Just pain, day after day

Every day , I have to look to ones I love and feel the disappointment. The rage, the sadness of my condition. Today, the same happened , the same way it happened day after day for a decade.

I don't know what to do. I would give everything to be okey again. There would be no price I would not pay, but I feel there is no real solution to my condition than an slow and solitary death"

I've come to accept my death and I embrace it with open arms. Each day drawing it closer, is a day where I am more and more happy knowing that the pain will go away. It sounds cliché but it really feels like it.

I've accepted that life is a flood, washing over me like waves crashing into rock, slowly eroding it away until there is nothing left but rubble and dust. It feel like I have no control in life. That I am just a person looking into another miserable persons life, who is getting worse day by day, slowly succumbing to the poison known as living.

I know that this sounds very cliché, but this is the best way of describing it. Grades are going down, I'm not loving what I do, I don't feel motivated to do anything anymore, feeling of existential dread is grinding against my soul like a grindstone at a knife, but no sharpening it, its dulling it and turning it into something with no porpuse, no love, no happiness. Hope for a better tomorrow is just fiction at this point. I try seeking help. I go to a psychologist and I try to get better myself.

Im thinking of just writing a suicide note for my parents, been writing a diery of all my thoughts, not well written but it gets some of the thoughts out.

I don't believe in any possibility of this situation getting better, my energy is running out and each new day is a dreadful possibility. It won't take me much more to step over the edge, into death this time."

drwzy8,SuicideWatch,Self hatred,"Every little thing I do wrong makes me hate myself so much more. I’ve done so much wrong I honestly feel like I’m past the point of no return. I really wish my body could just give up and die on command. 

My life feels like it is so far beyond repair. I just wish I was never born at this point nothing in life has been worth this. I will never be happy, and I don’t know what to do with that information. I want to die but I can’t do anything about it.

I wish I could just do something. I never do anything to try to fix my problems I just make more. I sometimes try to fix something but when it feels like I’m making progress I always take 10 steps backwards in the wrong direction.


I will never get better, I can only move downhill. I could keep typing forever about how much I hate myself but there is no point. I will never do anything about it. I am just a bystander watching as my life wastes away. I guess I should just hope it goes by quickly"

dawhau,SuicideWatch,(serious) Went to my doctor for help about suicide,"For depression and ->ANXIETY<-He called the police despite that i stayed calm all the time.


 Police rushed me and pushed me on the floor, i was so stressed out i couldnt move, and was like a stick (unvoluntary). They said i was resisiting and choked me until i managed to give them one of my arm. They finally handcuffed me and dragged me bottom naked outside the clinic, 2 cops were laughing at me because of that and many people have gathered aroung at this point, and i was still half naked...


 It took 10min for the ambulance to come and to  someone to hide my genital... Nobody took care of my pants and i still didnt get them back... (hospital was just accross the street of the clinic)

They brought me to the hospital for 72hrs and drugged me like i never been drugged before, because at this point (from now own all the rest is my fault) i couldnt keep my calm anymore.

 I was stuck in a super small room where nobody came to see me except to ask me trivial question like my name, adresse, weight etc. Nothing about why i was brought here. So i freaked out often and they shoot me. After this all went smooth. I like the effect of the sedatif so i freaked out from time to time just to get more. (no joke, anyway there was litterally nothing else to do)

They tell me they will transfer me to another hospital (probably because the 72hrs was close to end) I took the ambulance and once i was there... I dont remember ANYTHING AT ALL, nothing, niet, nada.

I have vague memories of me walking toward the main street to get back home, but i was 40min in cars from home... And i woke up yesterday without any idea how i got home... and today i wonder how to deal with all this situation.

P.s. I dont drink alcohol, smoke daily before night, so i dont think my own abuse made me loose the map. Im 35 years old man, never lost counscious ever in all my life before that. And also i have zero violences back ground.


With all this story my question is: ""now where do i go to find help?"" Everything on the Internet say to go see your doctor, but now i can barely get out of my house. It was already very hard but now its unbearable.

 I have constant suicide thought for over 20years now but also have full custody of my 12years old daughter which i love more than anything else in the world. (she's in no danger whatsoever i took care of telling her mom what was happening to me so she take care of her)

P.s.2. Im sorry if its hard to follow or understand, im french from Québec and there isnt much french forum to get help."
d270nf,SuicideWatch,there is so much pain in the world,"and i don’t know, i just wish there was more that i could do to stop it. i feel so responsible for all of the bad things people have done to me, because they have been through something bad themselves. september is just such a horrible month. there are so many horrible anniversaries, and so many tragedies. i know three people now who died in this month. my friend recently became homeless. i’m struggling with my studies. my sister told me about her abuse. it’s almost been one year since i tried killing myself and i’m still here, crying about everything and never really reaching out. i never do anything right. i just wish i could undo death, or do something to make things better for people. i wish i could die knowing it would impact nobody. i’m so alone. nobody really seems to care. i really wish every action didn’t have an impact.

i don’t know, i think this is a cry for help? i feel like i’m going to do something stupid and maybe at this point it’s not even stupid. i’m so sorry that i feel this way, partially because i’m sorry that i’m not living my teenage years happy, but mostly because i know i’m probably gonna end up killing myself even when i know it’s gonna hurt people."
8irmpx,SuicideWatch,I no longer want to die.,"The past few months have been difficult but I think I’ve finally come out of this depression. The day I was going to end it all, my boyfriend come over and took me for a long walk. I finally realized I have something to fight for. I know there will still be hard times in the future but right now I’m living in the present. Thank you to everyone in this subreddit for helping me. Keep fighting.
Edit: Wow, I didn't expect this to get so much attention. I'm glad to help. <3"
fwe558,SuicideWatch,"No one wants to deal with sad people, but get angry when they decide to do something about it.","I’ve reached out to people before and they just get hurt. They can’t handle it because it’s too much or too sad or they don’t have the time. It’s honestly fine. I understand that no one is obligated to listen to me or give me any of their time, but I know these will be the same people who will be upset if I’m gone. My sadness is so inconvenient that they’d rather me stay sad and destructive for the rest of my life than have to deal with any of it. There is no fix for my problems and I feel like it’s selfish for them to want me alive when they know just how awful I feel. They don’t have to help me, but they shouldn’t get mad when I try to help myself.

More context: I’ve also done therapy for 3 years and been on multiple meds for depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder. I exercise, practice self-care, and try to do my hobbies when I can pull myself out of bed. I have tried everything else to fix myself. I worked really hard just to keep falling to the same low point."
ei137q,SuicideWatch,Why are people saying that anyone under 18 can't be depressed?,"I've seen people say that, and that once you're 18 shit only gets worse, so anyone under 18 shouldn't complain. Are we really just that annoying?"

It's the only thing I can focus on. Probably cause it's the only thing I care about now. Everything else is just fucking brain fog."
e1h7fk,SuicideWatch,Am I the only one who finds thinking of suicide comforting?,"The fact that I can always kill myself is really comforting to me, it gives me a feeling of control of my life, that in the end I can decide my fate, and no one can do anything about it. 
It's weird, some days this is the only thing that keeps me going."
b5235o,SuicideWatch,I rather kill myself then working my entire life for greedy ceos and corrupt Politicians,"You need money to live. You need to work for money. Well.. I don't want to work the rest of my life, even with the occasional vacation because I'd still have to return to the job. Similar to how no matter how happy/better I temporarily feel(rarely) but return to depression once my mind takes over. I can't do this for the rest of my life, nor do I want to.. so I'm thinking about it..

fzn6gl,SuicideWatch,Only reason I haven't killed myself is the fear of failing and being forced to live as a vegetable,
d9cmlr,SuicideWatch,Isn’t it kinda bullshit that you can’t confide in anyone that you want to kill yourself without being committed?,"If you’re in such a bad place that you’re thinking of killing yourself but not at the point to where you’re in immediate danger of doing it, shouldn’t you be able to admit this, without being held against your will at a psychiatric facility that your insurance probably won’t cover, work won’t be happy about your absence at, where you’ll be given meds against your will and not allowed to leave?

What if I could admit this to a psychiatrist/therapist so that we can have a discussion about the most appropriate med + therapy combo to get me on the right track?

Because the idea of just trusting random mood stabilizing drugs being forced upon me as I’m whisked away from work and my daily life and not allowed to live my life or leave for 3 or more days *wouldn’t exactly inspire me to ask for help in the future*.

What if I could just be candid about how I feel so that I can get treated? Can’t imagine that I’m the only one who feels this way. Makes me feel horribly alone. How can I best be treated if I’m withholding this from my healthcare providers, when I’m not in immediate danger? Surely I’m not the only one who struggles, with this concept?"

7vvyjs,SuicideWatch,Threw all of my bullets in the river this morning.,"I'm not gonna lose. This isn't gonna beat me. Last time I felt like this, I threw my firing pin into my back yard. Once I felt better, I found it, cleaned it, and put it back. 

But at this point, I don't think I can ever have a gun again. got rid of the bullets first, since without them, it's useless. I think I'm just gonna drop it off at the police station and tell them I don't want it anymore.  


It's just so hard to fight. I don't want to be alive. I want to die. 

Things have happened to me in the past two weeks that could break even the strongest person. 

I found out my ex, who I still cared about deeply, was beaten to death. She died cold and lonely, with nothing. In the street in front a a fucking Salvation Army soup kitchen. She stole clothes to stay warm. And some asshole decided she needed to die for that. 

I found out that I have cancer. Even best case scenario, I am in for a ton of pain and misery. And that's if I even make it. I really hope I don't. 

And then, to top it all off: 

I got the girl of my dreams pregnant. 

The baby is gone. 

And she won't talk to me, at all. 

I'm not even sure what happened. Did she abort it? Did she miscarry? Was she trying to keep it? I can't get over the fact that I may never know the answers to these, and so many more questions. 

Like, we knew she might be pregnant. And she seemed to not hate me. But then, all in one message, she tells me that she was pregnant for sure, and now she isn't, and she doesn't want to talk to me anymore. 

How can you just give someone news like that and then disappear? 

I kinda wish I still had those bullets. And that's why I needed to throw them out. 

Even if no one ever sees this, it felt good to get it out. I have a therapy appointment in 8 days, and I'm just trying to hold out until then. "
kqlxcw,SuicideWatch,What's the point?,"we're all gonna die one day, who cares if i die sooner? when we're dead nothing will matter. we won't feel anything. i won't know if my family's suffering or not. it won't matter. why make me suffer?"
lrrd2z,SuicideWatch,Ever think about how you’ll probably die by suicide no matter what?,"I’ve been better. It’s been two years since I attempted. I go to therapy, I talk to my family and all that good stuff. I’m happy, I guess. Or as happy as someone like me can be.

But despite that, there’s still the feeling, the lingering knowledge that when I die, it will probably be from suicide. I’m happy now but what about later? In a few days, a few months, a few years? I think I’ve kinda accepted that it’s a fairly big possibility. Like it’s just an inevitable part of my life no matter how hard I try to be happy. There will always be an about 60% chance I’ll off myself at some point. Maybe tomorrow, maybe in a few years. It’s kinda morbid to think about I suppose. 

I know my family doesn’t think this (or they at least hope it won’t happen) and so I know if I were to tell them for some reason, it’s right back to an inpatient. But I suppose I’ve kinda accepted that that is just how my life works. No matter how happy I am, there will *always* be a big chance of me killing my self"
c5r5cq,SuicideWatch,I will not kill myself before I haven't tried everything,"I have made this decisions when I thought about suicide a lot last winter.

I hope you guys do this to it's really good to look at things that way.
Edit: Thanks for the silver u/DrHitshot I hope you are doing well!"
8zd2ia,SuicideWatch,It’s really sad how lonely being suicidal is,"Like, you can’t talk to anyone. 

And if you can, it’s like maybe one or two people. Half of them are probably your medical team, who check in with you once or twice a week, and are paid to care about you. 

You know all your “family and friends care” but it’s impossible to talk to them. You don’t want them to overreact. You don’t want them to worry. 

You can’t hang out with your friends anymore because you have nothing positive or noteworthy to say. No one wants to go to dinner or to a bar and hear about how you hate living. You don’t want to bring the mood down all the time. 

And the one person you trust to talk to can’t handle all of your stress. You can’t rely on just that person. It takes a toll on them and stresses them out too, so now you start censoring yourself and feel like you can’t tell them everything. 

And then you’re just stuck with your thoughts in your head. Wondering what’s the best thing to do. 


And then there’s the planning. 

What to write in your note saying goodbye. What to do with your dog. How to leave your apartment. What date to set. 

I just wish euthanasia was legal so I could die with my friends and family by my side. I wish I could talk freely about my thoughts and plans, and have support in my decision. I wish someone could be by my side in my last moments. 

But no, I have to do this alone. And it’s so lonely. 

I’m not afraid of dying. I’m slowly learning to not be afraid if I fail trying to die, and die suffering slowly and painfully. I just wish I wasn’t lonely through it all. I wish someone could hold my hand and hug me before I go.  "

What are you suppose to tell someone whos suicidal for completly logical reasons? Im not just sad IM BROKE. I dont have a safty net or support group. I cant afford therapy or medications. Im too emotionally fucked to get a job that requires anything more than bare minimum function dispite having a bachelors degree and the debt to go with it. Not that anywhere is hiring anyway. Im not even allowed to work over 39 hours because god forbid giving employees full time benifits or paying them a living rage. At any given moment im one breakdown away from losing everything. 

Ive spent my entire morning serching for a new job anything that im remotly qualitifed for and pays decent but i just cant. Im at a point that i dont even want to work. Whats the point of it anyway? To piss away the majority of my few wakeing hours on menial labor for what? Food and a place to sleep? What kind of life is that. 5 days a week wishing it would be the weekend (or whatever day off) already only to spend my short time away from work recoperating from work. 

Ive watched my parents stuggle my entire life. I went to school got good grades because i was told if i did that i wouldnt have to stuggle like them yet here i am no better off than they were. Im just tired of fighting the system. Im tired of being told to work harder then ill make it. I cant work any harder. I dont want to. I just wanna skip to the part where its over. If i have to pay to fucking live than im ready to cancel the subscription because its just not fucking worth it.

I know shit seems hopeless and working fucking sucks and society has so many problems but i dont want any of you to look at this as a reason to give up.

217jxj,SuicideWatch,"PSA from the SuicideWatch Mod Team: We're getting a lot of complaints about generic ""uplifting"" or ""I love you"" type posts and comments. Please read and follow guideline 4c in the sidebar.","We realise that most of the people who put up posts and comments of this nature want to help, and, if they haven't read the guidelines, it probably hasn't occurred to them that this might not be the right thing to do. But a) it's likely to backfire and b) there's no excuse for not reading the rules!

Responding to a suicidal person with messages like this (excerpted from a recent responder who we'll keep anonymous because they probably meant well):

>  You are not a failure. You are smart, you are young, you have an entire life to live. It is not impossible to become that person you want to be. You can be great.

is incredibly invalidating. If the person you're talking to were capable of believing that, they probably wouldn't be at serious risk for suicide.  And inflicting anything on them along the lines of ""you can do anything you want"" or ""life is worth living"", just disrespects their feelings and increases their sense of personal failure, because they can't do what you told them to do, believe what you told them to believe, or feel what you told them to feel.  As feeling like a failure and/or a burden is one of three most critical risk factors for death by suicide, it is not hyperbole to say that ***these so-called ""empowering"" messages kill people***.  

Guideline 4c links to [a previous PSA post](http://redd.it/1cep2h) that covers in more depth the reasons why this sort of ""cheering-up"" is absolutely against the rules here.  If you have any questions, please [shoot us a modmail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23SuicideWatch).  

App users, remember you can get to our sidebar here:  http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/about/sidebar

Our concerns aside, we are incredibly grateful to everyone who steps up and helps support our vulnerable OPs.  There's lots of stuff in the sidebar, especially [the talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) that we've put together to help you be more effective, and avoid dangerous intervention strategies.

**Edit:**  One other very dangerous type of message is ""It gets better"".  Because of the prominence of The Trevor Project and other similar initiatives, a lot of people seem to be coming to us with the idea that ""It gets better"" is not just an okay thing, but the *best* thing, to say to any suicidal person.  Nothing could be more wrong.  ""It gets better"" comes out of an initiative to reach LGBT youth who are being bullied and harassed in school.  And the getting better refers strictly to those behaviours, which *do* get better, on their own, with time, as people's peer groups get older.  It's a message intended to keep these kids from getting to the point where they're at risk for suicide.  But as a ""hopeful"" message for someone at risk, it's worse than useless.  First, it makes promises on behalf of the Universe - and the Universe may not keep them.  Second, it offers no understanding, but devalues or even trivializes their agony.  "

No one in my family saw it coming. He never showed any indication that he was suicidal, except for his drinking, which he did when everyone was asleep and he never, to my knowledge, did anything bad while he was drunk. I remember one time noticing a bunch of empty beers in the recycling and mentioning it to my mom. Looking back, he drank because of his demons but no one noticed.

For two weeks after my father ended his life, my siblings and I thought he had gotten in a bad car accident and died from his injuries. I believed her because in a way, she wasn’t lying but I’ll get to that. My mom told us after two weeks the true story of what happened and how he had killed himself and left behind letters for each of us. We were waiting for the police to hand them over including some other possessions.

Now later on, we found out about what happened. I think there’s still stuff about his or my mom’s life I don’t know. Stuff about that day. But here it is:

The day before, I remember my dad saying he was going off for hockey. I think I said bye but I don’t really know. That was the last time I ever saw my dad alive.

The next day, I’m waking up for school and I find out that my mom and my brother had been up for a while, talking to police. My dad was missing and there had been a car crash.

At school, I confided in one of my teachers about the situation and I was worried at all times.

I get home and play video games with my brother. My dad is in the hospital and my grandma is watching us while my mom is at the hospital. A little later, my grandma gets a call from my mom telling her to come down to the hospital and bring us. A cop car comes and picks us up and drives us to the hospital. We arrive, discover the death of my father and my grandma’s son, and I’m freaking out.

For a bit, I thought I had heard that he was just in really bad shape. About 10 or something minutes after “finding out he’s in bad shape” I discover that instead, he is dead. I went blank with crying. I was horrified. I was whispering to myself “no” constantly and I was rocking back and forth.

Rocking back and forth when I’m nervous, scared, tired, sad or any other bad emotion became a habit since that day.

I ended up going into the room where my dead father was lying, along with my mother and seeing him dead was horrible but his eyes were shut and he always had a soul patch and it was crooked so I was able to laugh to that and get to say goodbye.

I go home after a while along with my family. My brother was at the hospital and my sister was not. At this point, she had no clue that her dad had died. She was off at university far away and my uncle drove to her to pick her up and drive her back. She was 4 hours away. That’s a long trip. 

She was freaking out because a friend of hers, who heard what happened, sent her condolences about her father without mentioning that he was dead. She was picked up and was so freaked out and worried.

I fell asleep and at 1am when I woke up, I go downstairs to see my sister sitting in a chair crying and balling her eyes out.

My sister, who I barely see show emotion or cry. Someone who’s older and I looked up to. And she was destroyed by this. I went up to her and hugged her.

My siblings are never affectionate. We hate each other or at least that’s what we tell each other. My brother and I’s way of telling each other that we care about each other is saying “You’re a bitch”.

So hugging my sister, something I don’t remember ever doing before that or much after, was a big deal.

This ripped my family apart.

Here’s how that day went for my father:

He was driving back from hockey when he suddenly crashed his car. He got out and left the scene. He walked through the fields so GODDAMN close to my house, and eventually went and bought paper, a pen, a knife, probably some other shit and went to a hotel. He checked in and I don’t know how long he was in that room but what I do know, is he wrote out his letters. There were many crumpled up papers of letters he scrapped. The police found out about the crash and where he was by now. They were getting to his room when he was in the bathtub and slit his wrists.

I have convinced myself in the past that he only killed him self because the car crash messed with his brain. But the truth is, he tried to kill himself with a fucking car crash. To make it seem like an accident. And he failed. But he couldn’t take it anymore so he slit his fucking wrists even though he knew we would realize what had happened. My dad was so depressed that any way of ending it was good enough. He never tried getting help and he left his family.

I hate my dad for what he did. But of course I also miss him. This whole post has already taken so long to write because I had to take breaks so I can have mental breakdowns.

I was originally going to explain why I’m depressed but after writing all of this out, instead I’m going to say you know what, I’m not even going to continue. I am suicidal but I won’t do it any time soon so I can explain the many shit in my life that has caused that in a later post but I’m going to use this post to say that...

DO NOT KILL YOURSELF
Please don’t.
Don’t do it.
My dad killed himself and it destroyed my family.

I didn’t read the rules of this sub so maybe this post is going be deleted or maybe I’m not allowed to bring up certain things like how it is done, but people already knew about that.

My life sucks because of my dad.
He’s the reason I want to kill myself and he didn’t even try to get help.

I hate him. I love him but god do I hate him.

My mom has her own hand in my depression which if I ever do another post, I’ll get to, but my dad is the root cause of everything awful that has happened in my family in the last 5 years.

PLEASE
DONT
KILL
YOURSELF

SEEK
HELP

YOU

cpidz8,depression,"Depression for me is a constant feeling of wanting to go home, but no matter where I am, I am never home. Even when I’m at my physical home.","It’s a constant sense of wanting to go somewhere else. I’d feel better if i was at this place. Then you go there and then it’s the same exact feeling, just in a different physical location. 

I feel mentally homeless and I just want to go home.

Nothing else. No social life. No hobbies. Constantly battling your mind. And being absolutely fucking exhausted all the time."
7k1nt2,depression,A stranger just saved my life...,"I woke up today wanting to die. I was planning on doing it after school so I decided school was pointless to go to. I walked to the mall by my school and went to a Kneader's and ordered french toast. French toast has always been my favorite so I figured it would be a good last thing to eat. I pondered a ton about my life and what it is I really want. I felt super empty but also my mind was racing with thoughts. I had convinced myself I needed to finish my life today. I had been thinking for about half an hour when an elderly man sat across from me and gave me a hot chocolate. He said that he ordered it for me because he could tell I needed it. He told me ""I don't know what you're going through, but life will get better."" And then he left. And then I cried. And now I'm back at school, and I think I want to live.

bsrdr0,depression,I was going to kill myself tonight,"I wrote a suicide note earlier in the morning. I spent most of the day doing things that used to make me happy: getting coffee, walking in the park, listening to music, etc. I ate my “last meal” while listening to Bob Marley.

About an hour before I was going to kill myself, my friend from college messaged me and asked to play Xbox. We ended up reminiscing on good times, and laughing our asses off. It felt nice to feel like somebody cared about me. We’re planning on playing tomorrow too.

I don’t feel as bad as I did earlier today and I also am glad that I didn’t kill myself.

b7fxrm,depression,"Does anyone ever feel okay for a while, then a wave of depression just hits you like a truck?","Recently I thought I was beginning to feel better. Not quite happy, but just sort of... I don’t know, content? But my depression always seems to come back, sometimes stronger than others. This has happened in the past too. I’m worried that one day the gust of depression will blow too strongly and the branch i’m hanging onto will snap. Or maybe not. That could just be the apathy speaking though. Anybody else really frustrated by this? It feels like i’m always walking a razors edge between being fine, and being depressed and one misstep causes me to lose my balance. Ugh. 

Edit: evidently, there are quite a few people who experience similar feelings. I just want to say that it makes me happy in a sad sort of way to know that we are all going through something similar in our lives. It makes things less lonely."

I can write out 5 messages to a friend but never send them because everything I write feels like a lie.

I managed to initiate a conversation with a friend about it just now, then immediately had to back out of it because everything i wanted to say felt like I was simply seeking attention or somehow trying to trick them.

Even if I'm feeling optimistic about my future and, ""what if everything really does work out the way I want it to?"" I feel like it's way too tiring to live the life I want and all I want is to sleep and do nothing.

Everyone says life is short but to me it seems so long and burdening and I don't want to do it.

I have a financially secure job and I go to work every day and not only try my best but actively try to get along with others and make people laugh every day. My coworkers like me, and some look up to me. No one would think I have any problems at all. However, I feel like I am hidden behind a veil, and when I come home from work and when I am in the privacy of my home, I am in such crippling depression. I have such terrible episodes of sadness. I hate myself. I over-analyze everything stupid I do or say throughout the day and I replay it in my mind constantly and belittle myself. I don't feel proud of myself for any of my accomplishments and genuinely don't know why anyone even likes me. And yet I still get up every day, live this routine, and put on a facade like I am okay. It feels like I am living a double life that I cannot escape."

You will never understand how unbearable it is until you have experienced it yourself. Is a life without joy, pleasure, and reward worth living? What if I never heal from this?

In her memory I'm going to tell the people I love how I feel, give my dog a hug, and remember that she is in my corner rooting for me when I feel like nobody else is.

Like I have never known a time that I didn't experience severe recurring depression so it's just fuckin crazy that these people are real? One even said they don't understand how people can be depressed for seemingly no reason. Like I wish so much I could say the same.


Like logically I knew they must exist but it's still just unfathomable in my mind. It kinda makes me sad that I don't understand them just as much as they don't understand me. But I'm glad at least someone is happy in life. Idk man."

Not even a, “you don’t seem like yourself today, are you okay/look at this meme”/anything but treating them like an asshole who kicked your dog.

But I go through manic mood swings, and while on the depressive end I feel like absolute shit, when I'm out of that phase and feel somewhat ""normal"" again I tell myself I greatly exaggerated the effect in my mind. It doesn't help that my self loathing won't let me admit that I have depression because I keep thinking I don't deserve to be depressed.

cpvwhh,depression,Is anyone else strangely sick of being high functioning?,I know that the fact that I can brush my teeth and shower each day and show up to work each day is a blessing with my depression.

Each night I think to myself I can’t go on like this and each day I do. Part of me just somehow wishes I completely gave up and just hit rock bottom. I don’t know. Anyone else feel the same?

I kept coming back to the shop to do my homework and the owner and the baristas would always welcome me and they were always happy to see me. I started to get to know everybody there very well and now I consider them all friends. 
I found that when depressed having different communities helps a lot, and it turns out a lot of the other regulars at coffee shops also are depressed or have other mental illnesses.

Maybe you've seen enough happy, normal functioning people, that you have some idea of how to do what they do. That maybe you've made the same mistakes enough times that you could point them out and stop repeating them.

It's the idea that, you know how not to be depressed, so if you still are, then that means you must want it this way. And if you want it this way, well that must mean you deserve it.

But depression itself can make it impossible to act","Exercise/physical activity, eating healthy, spending time in nature, finding a hobby are all things that are supposed to ""be good for your mental health""... but by definition, depression is a problem *precisely because* it inhibits your inability to function, much less do things that are good for you. Finding a therapist, trialling multiple therapists to see which one suits me best, or even starting on antidepressants and having to check in with a doctor/psychiatrist every few weeks, or having to change medications because one might fuck up my head even more, or not even work... all takes so much fucking effort that I can't bother to do any of it.

I went to a counsellor at my university earlier this year, and they suggested things like group therapy for my anxiety and volunteering for causes because that can give people a sense of purpose in day to day life... and I just didn't know how to tell them, that is exactly the problem, *I have utterly no will to do any of that and that's why I'm sitting in your office right now and I don't know what anyone can possibly do about me being this way*.

If people with depression were able to so easily do things to help themselves, we wouldn't need to classify it as an 'illness' or 'disorder'. That's why it's so infuriating when we see how even 'professional' mental health advocacy organizations repeat the hackneyed slogans which I cannot understand how they are even still in mass circulation.

It's so irrational and frustrating that I'm physically able to take ten steps out of the house to just go on a goddamn walk, but I have absolutely no mental will to do anything but lie in bed. Only listening to music is the only action that can be done purely passively with no effort whatsoever, but then I just get sad and start spiralling from guilt. And I can't stop thinking about how irrational it is, even though I've experienced it for so many years. I'm constantly surprising myself from my own incompetence, as if I ever expected anything different.

More than hopelessness, I just feel confused as to what I'm supposed to do when I can't will myself to do anything. What even is this anymore?

I was so depressed 2 years ago I started skipping classes, I failed every single class I was in. My GPA dropped to a 1.7. I lost my financial aid, which I couldn't go back the next semester without.

I spent the last 2 years, becoming more and more depressed because I couldn't afford to go back and I ruined my life over depression. 

But I finally did it!!!! (with the consistent encouragement of my boyfriend who told me hes going to keep on top of my ass and I'm not allowed to skip class) I still have a year and a half left for my associate's because of how much I failed but it's a start.

jizxdt,depression,Being suicidal is like being at a terrible party,"Being suicidal is like being on a really terrible night out. I'm having a terrible time but my friends and family are all enjoying it so I stick around. They're the ones that invited me and said I'd have a good time. But as time goes on, the desire to leave just gets stronger and stronger so I try to distract myself by getting some more drinks to make it a bit more bearable but I still really just want to leave. But everyone is telling me that this is a great night out to be on and that I should just stay and try to enjoy myself. But I'm not enjoying myself. I'm just numbing my annoyance at not being allowed to leave with drugs and alcohol. I've got to the exit door a couple of times but I couldn't get any further than that. What's more annoying is that while I can get help to make the night out more manageable, I'm not allowed to just leave. I'm stuck here. It feels like this night out has just turned into a prison sentence."

lgdpee,depression,I hate 'foggy brain syndrome',"Does anyone else feel like their mind isn't as sharp as it used to be? Back when I was a kid, I was actually able to focus on things and had a pretty good memory. Now, it's like I'm on permanent autopilot. I rarely ever take note of my surroundings or have clear inner monologue. I'm always stuck in this half-awake state where I can't focus on multiple things at once and just kind of ""zone out"" so to speak. I also tend to forget things really quickly for some reason.

It makes me feel like some useless, brain-dead retard that can't even function normally or think basic thoughts. It's as if my cranium is rotting away or something. I'm stuck with permanent brain fog and there's nothing I can do about it. I take antidepressants and vitamin d pills, I drink lots of water, I eat healthy, but nothing works. 

I hate the fact that my brain will never work the same way again, all because of depression. It's destroying my life and I can't take it anymore.

Edit: In case anyone is curious, I don't do drugs or drink alcohol, nor am I old. I'm just a depressed 22 year old dude."

hasw9k,depression,Why does no one ever speak about the major memory loss that comes with depression?,"(I haven't been on this sub before so idk if it's discussed here more often or if it even happens to everyone but I have basically never heard of people talk about this aspect of depression) Seriously, before I had depression I didn't have the slightest idea that it would effect your memory and every time I mention my fucked up memory people are always suprised. I can't think of any good reason why this is compleatly ignored when people discuss about this because it has had a huge effect on my life. I can't explain how awful it is when someone talks about stuff i've said or done and I can't properly remember it myself.

Edit: everyone probably doesn't have this and it's not an offical symptom of depression but it definitely is a side effect. Like some people have said it all just blurs together. I think it has something to do with how you don't really enjoy the stuff you do so you just go on and do things without thinking or registering them. I mean I can't remember most of my childhood or early teenage years so don't know what's that all about but it's kind of a relief that im not alone with this.

Edit: it took me about 30 minutes (if not more) to read all of these comments. I didn't really read everyone all the way through or focuse on them but I tried to read them all. Still thanks everyone and im glad this helped some people."
i7ialo,depression,Depression is one of the few diseases that can end your life without killing you,"Like, I’m still alive, but I can’t experience my life anymore. I’m basically a walking dead zombie."
b8tms8,depression,The worst part of depression is that it's stolen my personality,"My actual personality is over the top, fun(in my opinion), confident, and kind. But the depression teams up with social anxiety so that I just don't have enough enough energy to act like who I truly am. I turn into this very flat, monotone, boring, quiet person who I would never want to hang out with or date.

It's the main reason I avoid social interaction now - it feels humiliating because I feel like I'm perceived as this pathetic, pitiable, ignorable person.

 When I'm feeling better and have a little more energy I can act like myself but usually I'm just this shell. It's horrible, like watching the progression of ALS in a loved one; they just slowly fade away until there's nothing left of who they used to be. At least with physical illness or bipolar or whatever you have yourself, that fundamental spark of who you truly are, and you're able to show that and share that with others. I don't even have that privilege. 

Sorry if this comes off as arrogant or insensitive, this is just how I feel.

edit: Guys, thanks so much for all the responses. I appreciate all of you. I didn't know so many people felt the same way, and I'm glad if I was able to help give voice to your struggles. I've had depression my whole life so I've had a lot of time to think about these things. I think it helps to be able to really narrow down what you're feeling. I wish you all luck in getting better."

I went to a hospital for help once but the environment/doctors just made me feel even more depressed and trapped. I have been really scared to go to the hospital since last time it just put me in a worse place. Now i know that i have to go because otherwise im certain ill just kill myself.

ifxaf7,depression,Depression = Losing intelligence,"The worst part about depression for me, even worse than suicidal thoughts or constant pain, is the huge toll it has on my mental faculties. 

I think slower. I need longer for decision making and understanding pretty basic things in conversations. I can't plan anything because it is too much mental effort. I read a sentence in a book and don't register the information it's supposed to convey.

I can't think as deeply. As a teenager, I was able to hold my train of thought and look at a problem for a long time and find an intricate solution. That's gone. My ability to think any deeper than surface level is lost. 

I'm not improving my programming skills, even though I do it professionally on a daily basis. I just don't seem to have the mental capacity for improvement. 

It has been like that for years, even worsening, I'm worried that I'll just stay ""depression stupid"" forever. It's also completely ruining my future, because I can't make any sound decisions.

EDIT: This blew up over night, I'm thankful for the lively discussion in the comments, thanks for the awards. May you all find a way to get rid of this. Lots of love."

buq56r,depression,"We only wish depression was being ""sad"".","But depression is much more than that. 

It’s the excuses you have to make when you can’t make that meeting. 

It’s the friends and family you’ve lost because you can’t explain why. 

It’s the opportunities that land in everyone else’s lap, that they get to grasp with both hands, while yours slip out of your grasp. 

It’s the exhaustion that binds your body to your bed. 

It’s the hatred and resentment you feel towards yourself, towards the world for being the way it is. 

It’s your proven truth that everything and everyone gets better, except for you. 

It’s the demon that dragged you down and trapped you in the hellish prison that is your own mind. 

It’s the ball and chain locked around your neck, choking the life out of you as you trudge through your marathon, while everyone else gets to charge on ahead, unimpeded. 

It’s the wall that blocked you off from life. 

It's the leech that sucked out everything positive about your life and clouds your memories. 

It’s not just being “sad”. And we can only wish it was. 

*Edited to add: Thank you all for the kind words and awards. I really didn't expect this to blow up as much as it did. I wrote this in an attempt to put my experience with depression into words, and to serve as a reminder of what it feels like, for the times when normal people try to tell me my depression isn't real or otherwise downplay it.*"
jz3rhk,depression,I (24 f) got dressed and did a bit of my makeup to meet up with a friend at a coffee shop. I’m in the middle of a depressive episode and dealing with some great difficulties in my personal life. She didn’t show up. This was my attempt to “reach out”.,"Update:

Sorry in advance, I’m on mobile and this is long. 
I really wasn’t expecting this amount of support and kindness from so many people. Thank you all for the uplifting words and thank you for the rewards! 

I’d like to first address any concerns about meeting up during the pandemic. My friend and I made plans to meet up at a coffee shop, buy a quick cup of coffee, and then immediately head to a park nearby in separate cars. The coffee shop is on small a military base so that cuts the amount of people that were in there down by a lot. I went ahead and grabbed coffee and then waited on a bench outside of the shop for around 30 minutes or so before leaving. I stayed 6 feet away from others and wore a mask the entire time. I played it safe and went by the rules.

Next I’d like to say thank you to those who have helped me realize how big of an accomplishment it was for me to get to the coffee shop. It really did take a lot of effort and I appreciate the reminder that it took strength I didn’t know I had. 

I also want to thank those who have expressed empathy towards my friend. She is going through a rough time and has been since long before the pandemic started. I wasn’t angry at her because I understand that she’s struggling too. I was just really sad and disappointed because I’ve only seen her once since last year. It was more of a bummer than anything and I just needed somewhere to get it off of my chest so I came to Reddit. Kind people of Reddit, you did not disappoint! 

I’m going to continue being her friend because she is very dear to me. Knowing the kind of person she is, she probably truly forgot, there was a potential miscommunication, or she may have had something come up that she couldn’t get out of. It would have been nice to get a bit of a heads up or an explanation, but I haven’t dwelled on it too much. She’ll reach out when she’s ready to. If not, then I understand that too. 

I’ve been in therapy and medication since 2018 and recently sent a cease &amp; desist letter and went no contact with my mother. As a result of that I haven’t heard from my Dad since it happened. I also live states away from my childhood friends and what’s left of the family that supports me (not many people). I’m better off being out of that toxic environment but it’s still a grief process losing people that are still alive. I have also been grieving what could have been if I only had healthy and supportive parents. 

I’m also struggling with my marriage. I’m a military spouse and it’s hard being so far away from the little support I have states away (my sisters). I won’t go into detail here about my rocky marriage but it’s been traumatic and hard. I haven’t gotten much support other than therapy and the support my younger sisters have been capable of giving. I’m in the process of filling out divorce papers and working with an attorneys office to explore my options. 

I also had surgery at the end of October to repair a hernia. It wasn’t too big of a deal, and my sisters came from out of town to visit during my recovery, but it did knock me down a bit emotionally because I was restricted from carrying anything over 20 pounds. That meant I couldn’t hold my toddler who is 30 pounds and that was really hard on both of us. 

It just would’ve been nice to be able to have hung out and talked to the one friend I have here about everything going on. It honestly would’ve been nice to talk about things that have nothing to do with all of the crap that has  gone on this year too. 

It’s okay though! Life will carry on and there will be better days. I still got my coffee, got outside, then came home and hung out with my son and put up Christmas decorations. 
I also got a ton of fantastic advise and support from you lovely folks. Thank you again!

TL;DR Thank you for the support and kind words! I’m not mad at my friend, just sad we couldn’t meet up. I followed social distancing rules when going out. 2020 has sucked but personally, so has the past decade or so."

gx4ic5,depression,"I'm black, I'm scared, tired and I'm at the end of my rope with life.","Jesus, how do I even start. As you could read by the title, I'm a black man. I've always been in the fight. Grew up with racism in all its forms in my country, which, ironically, usually denies there ever being racism in any way.

The kind of shit I've heard through my entire life has molded me into someone with no self-esteem, sense of self-worth, voice and made into introvert. Because of the mentality of ""you need to work twice as hard as everyone out there"", I always saw the future as bleak, tiresome and as more struggle. This never really changed. It just got worse with time, with college and the awful reality that came afterwards.

I've been depressed for most of my life, with my initial diagnosis at age 9. I still have it, with severe anxiety. My first suicidal thoughts came at age 8, and then and there I already hated myself for everything. For not being enough, for not being what the world wanted, for failing myself at being the best, for never getting anything good out of my own life, for never letting myself rest or be human.

And with all the recent events, like the absurd police brutality worldwide, the rise of authoritarianism in my country, with being worked to the bone and around the clock due to the pandemic, with my country quickly moving up to be the worst afflicted by covid-19 and my mom and me being in danger during these times by living in a neighbourhood near a place where a white supremacist parade happened, which also happens to be a place where a lot of people are simply disrespecting quarantine... All of this shit, is just wearing me down really badly.

I wake up exhausted. I can't deal with anything without having a serious bout of anxiety or anger outbursts, followed by fullscale breakdowns. I'm feeling guilty by worrying my friends and my mom. I feel guilty by feeling tired, by feeling afraid. I feel guilty by not feeling brave enough to go out on the streets for my people and taking action. I feel guilty for existing. I'm so fucking exhausted and I don't know what to do. I just want it all to end, I just wanna go somewhere else. I can't handle anything anymore.

Edit: all of this support... I'm very, very thankful for it. I think I've never felt this supported in my whole life. All of your words have touched me deeply. I'm so glad you helped me. I feel more hopeful, more energized from talking to you all. Thank you. Thank you all, from the bottom of my heart. You've all stopped me from doing something terrible today. Thank you.

Edit 2: wow, I was not expecting this kind of response from so many people. I'm trying to respond to everyone, but I think I can't. I'd like to thank you all once more for all your words. I'm very glad that I vented about all these feelings here with you all. I feel so much support from you and I feel like my feelings are valid and worth feeling. It may seem a bit dramatic, but I'm legitimately walking out of this with a different outlook on life. I never expected to see so many people I don't know just rush in to support me when I'm in my absolute worst. So thank you, once more for being here for me. I mean it. I love you all"
hg7t7e,depression,it’s so weird how parents swear they know you better than you know yourself but can’t see when you’re not happy,It’s been so bad lately. My sleep schedule is completely fucked. The lower left corner of my bed is full of trash and I can’t toss and turn in my bed without feeling a crumb. I don’t leave my room unless it’s to get food or see my mom because she works from home all day. I haven’t changed clothes in a week. At least I’m showering and brushing my teeth and stuff. That’s become a habit ever since I got two cavities from not doing so in a month. It’s like I don’t want to talk about it because I hate talking about it. I just want to go to the doctor get a therapist or some shit and never talk to my family about anything like it. Because I’ve still got doubts whether I have depression or I’m just lazy and a shitty person.

I’m trying so hard to get better. I’m glad my cat jumped on me. That sweet little guy saved me.

Edit: I want to thank everyone for their kind words. I didn’t expect to receive so much kindness. For those wondering, I am currently seeing a therapist and psychiatrist for mental health and medication management.

To the few people who said hurtful things. My story may be “cliche and boring” but it’s still my fucking life. It’s my experience, I can’t change it to make it more exciting or interesting for you.

dx2la6,depression,An unexpected side effect of depression: the decline of cognitive capabilities,"This has been really scaring me lately. Since becoming depressed I've noticed more and more;

- an inability to maintain thoughtful conversations with people

- severely reduced attention span

- short term memory loss

- severely reduced motivation

I think it largely has to do with my partaking in escapism, as I spend much more time browsing reddit/youtube and getting high since when I actually try to focus on work I usually end up crying. The result seems to be a feeling like I've been living in a haze, like I'm never really fully aware of what's going on, I'm just passively going through the motions of life. 

Getting out of this rut is going to be so much harder than I thought. I literally feel stupider now that I've been depressed for months. I can barely even talk to people in my classes now, they seem so competent and on top of things while I'm just an embarrassment who can barely form a coherent sentence."

Everything is shit. I never brushed my teeth consistently for years and now it’s fucking me. I’m so ashamed my face is disgusting. My face I don’t have the energy to wash and my teeth are getting yellow because I never have the energy to brush

I don't feel like I've had real interests since I was a kid. I basically haven't ever had adult friends, either. I just kind of float through life. 

I just wonder who I would be if I hadn't spent so much of my life as the emotional equivalent of a potato, if I didn't keep living knowing that even with treatment that that inert, non-person version of myself is going to keep coming back and all I can do is manage it."

I imagine myself as a successful athlete (I know it's stupid) and I imagine how I'd interact with people and the questions they'd ask.

It's disappointing to come back to my real life and realize what I am. I've done nothing with my life for the past 8 years. And nothing is moving forward. I compare myself to other men my age, and I am a failure in every aspect. I am no better today than I was 5 years ago.

You knew about my trauma and mental illness from day one! Why even entertain the idea of wanting me if you were just gonna reject me for things outside of my control anyways! Do you know how devastating and invalidating that is? That’s like saying someone with a disability can’t love someone because they’re not “normal”. Tbh I think the only reason guys do this is because they see girls like me as easy targets.

jwjfl0,depression,"Two years ago, I (30m) thought I’d have a family by now. Instead, I’m alone and have cancer.","My ex (31f) ended our eight-year relationship soon after Christmas of 2018. We had intended to get married in May of 2019 and had plans to settle down and start a family. But she got cold feet, married someone else less then six months later, and is now pregnant.

Since then, I’ve gone on a few dates with people I’ve met on various dating apps, but haven’t had any success. Rejection never feels good, but the most recent rejection, which came after a few dates, hit me hard.

It’s opened up my eyes to the fact that I have pretty much nothing to offer. Besides being no better than average in any way, I have cancer, which isn’t exactly a selling point. I don’t know whether it’s terminal, and neither do my doctors. I’m seeing my oncologist in two weeks, and to be honest, I’m hoping for bad news. 

I’ve been dealing with depression since I was a teenager. For the duration of my previous relationship, it wasn’t much of an issue. Since then, it’s gotten considerably worse."
ie47wl,depression,Being depressed and having depression are different.,"I have clinical depression. I was diagnosed about 5 years ago. It really hits me hard sometimes. One of my friends does not understand that people can 100% get depressed because of nothing. She thinks people only get depressed for a specific reason. Such as someone passing away, or a horrible break up. And those things are awful, those feelings are valid and the literal worst. But, she doesn’t understand that people can just be depressed for basically no reason at all. I’m currently having a depressive episode. Nothings wrong. I just can’t get out of bed... I can’t do the dishes. I can’t pick up the take-out off my bedroom floor. I can’t. 

I just.. I can’t hear the “but.. why are you depressed?” question one more time. Fortunately and unfortunately, I’ve been dealing with this illness for long enough that I know that this feeling will end, and I know how to somewhat manage it. But, if she were to say that to someone else.. I just worry that it could end someone’s life. 


Anyway, that’s all. I’m sure no one will even read this. K bye

ck913s,depression,"The reality of depression: Yesterday I was googling ""most effective suicide methods"". Today I feel fine.","This has probably happened hundreds of times in my lifetime. I'm 50 now, so obviously I haven't succumbed to depression yet. But the peaks and valleys are insane; I guess *I'm* insane. Yesterday it fully made sense to me - if I had had immediate means to end my life I could see taking that action. This is why I can never have a gun, or live in a tall building.  
So far that small voice in me that says ""It will get better, just wait"" has remained more powerful than the other larger, louder voice that says ""You've always been alone. You'll always be alone.

I feel empty all the time, yeah, I have a diagnosis, yeah, but I still manage to doubt myself anyways. It almost feels like it’s normal to feel empty. It’s strange when people tell me they can do their school work, have a job, and feel happy by second nature. It seems like feeling this way is normal, but I also feel like I’m alone in this? It’s weird. I tell myself things like, “this isn’t because of the depression, it’s because you’re worthless and incapable of doing anything.” I tell myself that this is an excuse to sit in bed and do nothing.

gnmp5u,depression,I hate how fast I go from being okay to empty and depressed,"I was doing fine this past month, I’ve been getting up early and being productive and just being okay for once. I started talking to this girl and things were perfect, we have lots in common and we seem to be on the same boat on things. I haven’t been in a relationship in a while but she made it clear she wants to be with me in time. Yesterday I invited her to hang out with my friends and I and she was just so different than she is when we’re alone. When I tried to hold her hand she didn’t let me. Afterwards she texted me and said she’s not ready after all and realized it when I tried to show affection in front of my friends. We’ve only been talking for about 2 weeks so it didn’t completely destroy me, but I just always get attached quick so I’m still upset about it. It seems like every person I see myself with always tends to end things for one reason or another and I’m over it. 

Being a front line worker is exhausting as it is, but having a failed “almost relationship” again is messing with my head and I’m starting to feel the darkness overwhelm my thoughts when I’ve spent the majority of the last few years working on fixing that. It’s hard when I put all my effort into people that don’t do the same back. You know when you stare into nothing and start overthinking everything about your life? I’m starting to think I’m the problem behind all these failed relationships. I know she’s not worth it, I don’t think it’s her specifically making me feel this way as much as the patterns that keep occurring in my love life. I don’t know what to do anymore.

EDIT:  Finally got back here and wow, did this take off.  I went through every last one of your comments.  I'm in a brain fog even as I write this so I don't have the right words but thank you for all your stories, support, advice, information and so much more.

As much in pain as I am right now I am so grateful.  Because until now I was missing a huge understanding of my condition.  A doctor once told me I was ""living in a dark room.""  Well part of that dark room was not understanding the mental handicaps, and possible permanent loss of function, that go along with this disease.

So I hope you have had ""a-ha"" moments about your condition too.  So that we can all be on the way to recovery, like some have fortunately accomplished. "
edpkii,depression,Does anyone else experience anger as a part of depression?,I always feel angry or annoyed or nothing is going right and I've felt like this around the same time as my depression reared its ugly head.

ecb4lx,depression,How many other people go to sleep wishing they'll die peacefully before they wake up?,"I read this a lot here, ""I don't want to kill myself, I just wish I didn't exist"".

All I want is to simply not wake up tomorrow. Is that so much to ask for?

Edit: wow, I did not expect to get so many responses when I wrote this yesterday. Although sad, it's still oddly comforting to know I'm not alone in feeling this way, so thank you sincerely for sharing. For those who offered helpful tidbits, thank you also. I hope that you all find peace one way or another, just as I hope that I can too. But let's face it, chances are that's won't be tonight, so.... here we go again."
jqkwz0,depression,My therapist gave me an advice that I wanted to share,"As a part of my mental illness, I suffer from strong self doubts and feelings of being worthless. And I often got told that if I have these, I need to think very positively about myself and realise that these thoughts aren't true. But it never worked, my negativity is way too strong to be able to habe any positive thoughts about myself, let alone to have stronger positive than negative thoughts.

So my current therapist suggested another approach. She said, instead of forcing myself to think positive, I should try to not evaluate myself at all for a certrain time. Neither negatively nor positively (though the second is rather rare anyway). What this does is that it gives some distance to the negative thoughts and therefore breaks that cycle of depression where depression makes me have negative thoughts and the negative thoughts make me depressed.

This is way easier because I just have to be neutral instead of positive and I notice what she means with breaking the cycle. I hope that this might help someone here.

Edit: I don't know what to say right now... Last time I looked at my phone this had 10 upvoted and I was so happy that 10 people considered this useful and now I see this... Thank you so much, this means the world to me."

eczhm3,depression,"My friend attempted suicide a couple days ago. My family is saying I will ""ruin Christmas"" if I spend time with her in the hospital on Christmas Eve instead of visiting them. What can I do?","A good friend of mine with whom I've been attending therapy for BPD overdosed a couple days ago. She survived and was transported unconscious to the hospital. She woke up but is unsurprisingly devastated. I want to be there as her support, she has a boyfriend but no family members who care about her and few friends. I had plans to see my family for Christmas but when this happened, it left me deeply depressed, particularly because another good friend of mine had committed suicide four years ago almost on the same day. To elaborate, I don't like spending Christmas with my family. I like them, but Christmas has always been more about chores and preparations than about quiet and peace. 

I thought I would spend Christmas by visiting my friend in the hospital. I don't want her to be alone, I know that if I were in her situation I would appreciate it if someone came to visit me. So I proposed this to my mother and brother, even the possibility that I would spend the afternoon with her and then go down to see them before dinner. However, their comments left gasping for air. They showed little empathy for my friend or me. My mother asked me if I had any ""normal"" friends. My brother told me that while it's ultimately my choice, I would be ruining Christmas by not coming down, or even by coming down just for dinner, that everyone would be disappointed in me and it would create arguments, implying I would be at fault for them. 

Here's the breakdown:  with my family, I risk being ostracized for weeks if not months if I don't go down there. However, I've felt more and more like they were less and less my family, while I've felt like my friends have shown more compassion and empathy for my depression and BPD than my family ever has - in fact, they've dismissed it as me ""not having enough social activity"", as ""not having enough will"", and have called my therapy ""a waste of time."" I feel like visiting my friend is the right thing to do, I know I will think of her the whole time I would be down at my family's, but I do not want to be ostrasized for months. I don't think I could handle it with my mental condition. 

Any and all thoughts are welcome. Thank you."
kgmy1e,depression,I secretly hope that I will be diagnosed with a terminal illness so I can die without taking my own life,"Hey Reddit. Drunk me here, mainly looking to vent because I have noone else. No alts because fuck it, might dox myself.

Picture this, I met a woman. I fell in love. Hopelessly in love. Three years later, she gets pregnant. We were both young, and scared, but I tell myself I will do anything I can to make it work.

I have a baby. I cry. I promise MY baby girl the world, and the love I never had. But then things change.

The woman lives with her parents, I no longer can stay there with her and her family due to ""covid."" Okay thats fine. Go to the store? Quarantine for two weeks. Saw someone? Quarantine for two weeks. Quickly realized my opinion is not regarded about the baby. My input has no sway on how to raise her. Suddenly feel like a babysitter, I am ""allowed"" to come over after work, watch the baby, while her mom ignores me.

Eventually the woman I fell in love with starts being distant. It's little things at first. She doesn't want to cuddle. She stops kissing me. She stops inviting me to things. Then she tells me she's gay.

I decide I can make it work right? I love this woman! She says she wants to be with me still? I'll make it work of course. But then she starts antagonizing me. Insinuating I am a bad father for not being there full time for the baby when I dont have a choice. Ignoring me. Arguing with me.

I am... heartbroken. I don't know how else to describe it. I can't help but ask myself if I did something wrong. I keep telling myself I can make this work but it only gets worse. I have recently fallen into the worst depression of my life. I have had a couple suicide attempts in the past, the only thing stopping me now is knowing I would be leaving my baby girl without a father.

I dont know what to do. I donf know what this post was to accomplish. Maybe to rant? Get this off my chest? Who knows. I sure don't.

Edit: I barely remembered making this post. Was too afraid to look at the replies for awhile but I'm glad I did. You guys have given some real good advice and I'm thankful for it, thank you."
j0okgo,depression,"i feel like when a lot of other people say they did nothing all day, its completely different than when i do nothing all day.","Other people will talk about how they did nothing and all they did was, go on a walk, go to the store, play some video games etc. when honestly their day seemed pretty eventful, like if that’s their nothing then what is a good day for them? when i do nothing, i actually just kinda do nothing. I just sleep and lie in the dark and just, idk be sad. Maybe get up just to go and eat or go to the bathroom but thats it yk. Idk its weird.


edit: wow i just woke up to all of this thanks everyone :)"

Edit: Thanks for all the supportive comments. To those suggesting I not open up to people who don't get it, I completely agree.

I just have no energy and don’t feel like talking or doing anything. So please stop making me feel guilty for being this way, please stop being short and impatient with me, please give me time and space. 

Just please, stop assuming what mood I’m in and actually listen to me for once before you actually do put me in a bad mood."
g8eq07,depression,"I’m 19, my girlfriend was murdered, the trial is soon and I’m getting more and more depressive","Hi y’all,
Well I'm not used to posting on forums but I feel so bad atm and I can't open up about this to my family, my friends or my therapist even if they want that, I feel completely unable to talk about it with them.
I’m a 20yo man. I‘m Irish but my family moved to France when I was 5 and that is where I have lived since.
I grew up in a small country village, the school had only two classes. I hardly spoke French but I got a friend very quickly, I’ll call her Honey in this post.
 So Honey and I were friends all our childhood, we were in the same class every year and we were also neighbors so we played together every day after school. Year after year I became bilingual in French and made lots of friends, but I started to have a crush on her.
When I was 11 we started middle school, we were still in the same class and all our classmates were trying to get us together, but we were pretty shy at that time so we didn't dare to « flirt ». Finally it was the following year, when I was 12 years old, that we got in relationship. Ofc the feelings I had for her weren’t as strong as those I had for her when we grew up up because we were still young but I was so happy.  She was the first girl I kissed, the only one actually.
We kept growing up, we were always in the same class every year and we kept spending all of our time together. If I explain that, it’s so that you understand that from my 5 to 19 years I almost spent every day of my life with her, she gradually became as essential as breathing for me. The more the years went by, the more « serious » (important to each of us) our relationship became. We never argue, ofc sometimes we didn’t agree with each other but we knew how to put our differences aside and respect the point of view of the other.
Then when I was 15 we started high school, at that time we were in a relationship for almost three years and people were amazed by the longevity of our couple, because at that age it’s unusual.
But we loved each other so much (and I still love her so much), it was like I had found the perfect person to me and I don't want to speak for her but I felt like I was perfect to her.  We kept growing up, we did our first time together (and all the others, I never had sex with another girl). We wrote long love letters to each other, any pretext was good to say how much we loved each other. I mean, I'm kinda  that cliché of the chunk rugby player, people don't really imagine me doing that, yet for her I‘d have done anything and everything, she was so exceptional, I felt incredibly privileged to be part of her life.
We graduated high school and that summer we moved into our apartment, then started university. I was so glad to live with her, to sleep with her every night. Of course our parents let us sleep together on weekends and holidays but it wasn’t the same, it was a new step in our relationship and we were so happy.
When I explained to my new mates from the university that I had been with my girlfriend for 6 years they were stunned, they asked me if I had never wanted to flirt with another girl or anything and the answer has always been no : since my childhood, I grew up alongside this exceptional girl and I always dreamed of being with her and I felt so lucky to be in a relationship with, I never even noticed any other girl. I found her perfect in every way.
We were so happy. I just want to tell you a little bit about the great person she was. She was so heart warmed, she couldn’t stand injustice. She always wanted to help others. She was so kind and caring. Whenever our friends needed advice or support for something she was the one they call, she was full of wisdom and good intentions. She was always smiling, she illuminated people's lives with her presence.  She was a very funny person as well.  She always saw the bright side of everything, she was so positive. She never gave up, she worked hard to reach her goals. She was so clever, I’d even say brilliant, she was a very gifted student. She was passionate : when she did something she put her whole heart into it.  She made people feeling special, she knew how to bring out the best in them. She always complimented everyone, she was adorable. She was also sensitive, she hated seeing the ugly things of the world, she could cry for that.  But she was also someone who made the world more beautiful by her mere presence.  I’ve never met someone so selfless and altruistic. She was also incredibly beautiful, the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen. She was an angel, for her friends, for her family, for me, for my family who loved her too. My mam has three sons and she was used to say that Honey was like her daughter.  My little brother was kinda an hooligan when he was younger and listened neither to my parents nor to me.  She spent so much time helping him, because of her he really took control of his life again.
Everyone loved her, literally.  She was wonderful. She was someone who loved to pamper people.  She could spend weeks making a gift or a surprise for someone, but she was always embarrassed when someone gived a gift to her. I think she was one of the few people who was sincere when they said they preferred to give than to receive.
I felt so good with her, she was the love of my life, literally. I always wondered how she could love me so much, I mean I‘m not that bad and I always did my best especially for her but she was so much better than me. And yet she still looked at me like I was one of the wonder of the world.
We were so happy. I was only 19 years old and yet I saw my life with her and she saw her life with me, we had lots of plans. And even beyond me, she was a great person, who was so young and had her life ahead of her. I mean, if we had broken up, it’d have been incredibly hard but at least she would have kept existing, living, shining as she deserved.  But I cannot bear what happened.
We were together, so happy and in love, I never could have believed that she will  disappear so quickly and in such a brutal way.  No one deserves that and when it happens to someone so close to you, someone you love so much, it’s extremely harsh.
It was a Sunday and we were at our parents’ for the weekend. Sometimes on weekends we slept together and sometimes we slept on our own and we just spent the day together.
On Saturday evening we slept each on our own, her at her parents’ and me at mine, there wasn’t even a particular reason. On Sunday morning she wanted to run for an hour and offered me but I was lazy. I was tired, I wanted to stay in bed an hour more.  It’s absurd : I was studying sports science and I was too lazy to go running. I‘d never forgive myself.
It’s an ongoing case so I’m not allowed to speak in detail about it and anyway it doesn’t have to be, but she was violently assaulted and tortured and died, and then her body was burned. Suspects were arrested a few weeks later, it was in Feb 2019 and the trial was supposed to be in May 2020 but it was postponed because of the coronavirus (France is in quarantine).
I cannot even describe the infinite pain I felt when a few days after his disappearance, while very important research was being carried out, her body was finally found and we knew what had happened to her, I had a blackout.
Since I woke up from this fading away I have been taking heavy psychotropes, that doesn’t prevent me from constantly having anxiety attacks and having to take a fuck ton of sleeping pills to sleep, otherwise I have awful nightmares. I never thought I‘ll fall so low one day, I have always been someone very happy and full-blown.  But I never thought that the love of my life was going to be murdered one day either.
I haven't been going to university since, I don't do anything except think about her all day, I saw a lot of therapist but they only say shit, how am I supposed to accept the sudden death of the  person I love the most in the world and with whom I grew up believing that we were going to spend our lives together ? They tell me about the emotions of mourning but the only emotions I have are deep feelings of hopelessness and hatred towards those who did this.
I feel even worse since I know who did this and what their ""reasons"" were, because they were people I knew. I feel devastated. Sometimes I want to kill myself and sometimes I want to avenge her by killing them. But I feel unable to inflict this pain on my parents, who are very friends with Honey's parents (They had been friends for a long time before, because we are neighbors) and who help them a lot to hold on since it happened, I can see that they have the fear is that I kill myself and to be in the same state as the parents of Honey.
Her parents are suffering so much, they lost their only daughter and I don't know what to do to relieve their pain. Whenever I speak with them they seem so happy all of a sudden, they say that Honey kept living through me. But imo it's not true, she no longer lives and will never lives again and I miss her so, so much. But I know if they say that it’s because they miss her so much too. She is missed by everyone who knew her, she was so wonderful. And I will always miss her.
People tell me that one day when I’ll be happy again and I‘ll meet someone else and go back to normal life. But I know it’s wrong, first I‘ll never be happy again, how am I supposed to live without her after growing up with her ? She was as essential to me as breathing, it’s unbearable to survive since she‘s no longer there, how can I resume a normal life ? And how can I meet someone else ? I never wanted when I was happy and she was there to meet someone else so it isn’t now that I‘m desperate without her that I‘ll want to meet someone, plus she is irreplaceable. I feel devastated. She is the only one I want and yet I know she‘ll never come back. I constantly think of her, of her laughter, her smile, her scent. I bought her perfume and I spray it on my pillow every day, I know it's stupid but it's the only thing that helps me sleep a little better. I just wanna hug her again. Sometimes when people lose a loved one they say they regret not telling them how much they mean to them and at least I’m « relieved » that Honey knew how much I loved her and how important she was to me when she passed away, because I told her every day.
Just before the quarantine there was a commemoration for the one year of her death and everyone looked at me with pity. As I no longer go to class, in rugby or to see my friends I don’t see anyone and I had not seen some people for several months, they were dazed by my appearance. And I hadn't realized but actually I became the shadow of myself, I always was very « strong » and now I‘m extremely bony. It depressed me even more to see how many people seemed concerned when they saw me. That's why I avoid my friends, they don't know what to say (and I understand that's normal, in their place I wouldn't know what to say either) and they‘re also embarrassed not to know what to tell me.
The only person I used to open up to is Honey, and now having to deal with such difficult emotions without knowing to who open up is very painful. My family is trying to support me as much as they can but it's very hard, there was a very bad atmosphere at home, so much so that my parents broke up and my father went back to Ireland with my older brother. I feel like my mom and little brother don't know what to do with me anymore. But I don't know what to do with me either. I think that after the trial I‘ll go to Ireland for a while as well, just to take a break, here every time I go out everyone is aware of what happened, throughout the region (and even outside, but here they recognize me so they look at me with that pitying air that depresses me even more).
I’m not afraid of the judgement, I know they‘ll have a long sentence but I‘m very afraid of the trial in itself and to, during a week or two to, hear what she has been through in detail all day, to see her murderers and to hear what they‘re going to say, I‘m anxious I cannot bear it.  For the moment I’m trying not to think about it. I spend all my time in the tree hut that his father built between our gardens when we were younger. We spent all our time there, when we were teenagers and our parents didn’t want us to sleep together we secretly met there and stayed all night. Everything remained as it’s, when I’m there I feel calmer.
I feel like nothing can ever ease my pain, I don't even know why I came to tell my story here. I just needed to open up and I can't do it with my loved one. I don’t think anyone will have read this anyway."
iwhnis,depression,When you're lying in bed and you slowly feel tears from in your eyes and roll down your face you know its back. But it's not even back because it hasn't left in the first place.,Today is one of those days where I feel miserable haven't gotten out of bed. I just feel awful.
hoauh0,depression,“You’re faking your depression because you look happy”,"I fucked up. My colleagues/friends at work asked me in which Reddit group I posted the most stuff. And I said in r/depression without thinking. Because my brain is a slow, stupid piece of shit. So they said “Just because you get sad sometimes doesn’t mean you have depression” and “A lot of people are faking depression nowadays” while they both suspiciously looked at me as if I’m some kind of murderer. 

At work I’m super “bubbly” and “happy” AND IT IS FUCKING EXHAUSTING. After they said all that, I became too awkward to reply. So I walked away, hid myself in the back and started acting like myself again. I just sat on the ground for a bit. Did nothing. Felt like shit but also emotionless. Like I’m floating. Empty, alone and misunderstood.

I’m definitely not faking my depression. And it freaking hurts when people don’t believe you because you “seem happy”. I automatically become fake happy at work or with friends even though I despise being like that. Faking and socializing takes up a lot of freaking energy so when I’m finally home I’m just dead in my bed.

I’m not positive or bubbly. I’m a negative piece of shit who can’t even leave her bed most of the time or brush her teeth everyday. +a shitty past and a shitty present and had a burn out and no support and so on. Yay. Super happy.

Ps: Sorry, I swear quite a lot when I’m upset.

doqwow,depression,"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it","We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them."
d3mqe2,depression,I'm breaking apart and no one gives a fuck.,"I swear to God, if I manage to kill myself and someone say some bullshit like ""If only she talked to us we'd have helped"" I'm coming back as a ghost to make their life a living hell.

fsg8zk,depression,My 17yo lovebug doesn't remember me anymore,"So my cat apparently got alzheimers and it's breaking my heart... All the things we have been through, he has been there for me like no other person in my life has, all the play and joy, hardships, running in and out to the vet, petting him and loving him, waking up every morning with him looking at me and meowing, following me downstairs and watch me make coffee... and now, all that is gone. It's like he seized to exist, wiped out his hard drive.. I got him when I was 14yo, my cousin gave him to me, when she learned I had a hard time because my mom had cancer and also breaking up with my father. My life was in pieces... But my cat, he mended my heart. He gave me love and support when no one else did. He was there for me, always, no matter my mood, and I loved him so so much... Now he is gone, but his physical self is there, but none of his personality, he stopped doing all the things that was him, he is only existing atm, doing all the necessary things like eat, drink, sleep, poo... But not making contact with me, not cuddling, not meowing. I look into his eyes and I don't see him there anymore.. I am so sad right now I don't know how to think positively about the future without him. I feel completely shattered.."
imhcet,depression,I’m finally telling my parents I need help today.,That’s it. I don’t really know what else to say besides that I accept that I need help. I’m proud of this step I’m taking.
lbdal4,depression,I think my wife saved my life this morning.,"I have severe anxiety. Taking meds, but they’ve kind of stopped working like they used to. Got into a conversation with my wife yesterday and I mentioned “if I were to be in a place where I could just sit still and not have my brain worry about something, I don’t know what I would do with myself.” Anyway, I don’t get into depressive moods too often anymore,  it this morning, 3 days before our 5th anniversary vacation (we never take vacations. Never have the money.) I check my bank account and realize that all of the bills I had planned to come out last week all hit at once and put our account into the negative. By quite a bit. I panicked. My wife had been looking forward to a small trip to Chattanooga to just relax for MONTHS. The kid was to stay at my parents house and we were just going to relax for a few days. When I realized I
messed up the timing on our bills, I spiraled. I absolutely lost control and cried. Lost it. It was probably the worst I have ever felt. I was crying for about 10 minutes when I suddenly had this sense of calm wash over me. Suicide. Easy. I got out of bed, suddenly stoped crying, cleaned my face up and began getting dressed. I told my wife I was going out for a little while. She knew something was going on and refused to let me leave the house. She physically grabbed me, made me look her in the eyes and told me everything was fine. It brought me out of my head. I don’t know if it’s something that I would have gone through with, but in that moment it was the most ok I had ever been with the idea of suicide. We still don’t have the money for the trip, but that’s ok. I know I have someone looking out for me. 

Sorry for the rambling, but I figured I just needed to get it out of my head."

6mplah,depression,Suicide ice cream,"I contemplated suicide a few years ago. Couldn't take it anymore, everything was going to shit (you could argue it still is), obstructive suicidal thoughts,etc. So one day I decided to kill myself by hanging. Pretty straight forward right? Well the thing is i live in a bad neighborhood and there aren't a lot of hanging -friendly trees. They were only on main streets and i can't hang myself in front of the free clinic. I'd make them feel bad. And someone would take my shit, cant have that. Very surreal and fustrating using Google Maps to find a half decent suicide spot especially when you're working with shitty MetroPCS service.

Finally i found a spot. Small walking bridge in a secluded section of a neighborhood park. Good. Now for the suicide note. I get to work, banging it out all through the night. ""Not meant for this world"" ""i know you'll miss me but it's for the best."" Hit all the basic bullet points. Done. Now..........make a noose. But idk how to make a noose........so i look it up on WikiHow. 20 studious minutes later i have a functioning noose. All of a sudden i feel something from deep inside my deadened, numb brain. I'm proud of myself?? I'm proud if myself!!! I try to switch back to suicide mode but my mind is wandering now. ""I made a noose, thats kind of dope."" ""What else can i make?"" ""Homemade ice cream? Hmm."" So at around 4:30 am on a weekday, possibly a tuesday, i made homemade ice cream and here i am now typing this from a crappy android phone.

P.S. the ice cream was terrible

edhcd2,depression,Does anyone feel like the less interesting person while hanging around other people?,"Like, your presence is not important, everything would be the same even without you."
dcb40b,depression,I’m killing myself [update],"So most of you probably didn’t even see my post before, which is fine, obviously, but I just felt the need to put this update out for the ones who did. 3 days ago I was so close to taking my own life. I was going to jump off a bridge and end it all. I was drunk so it made matters only worse. As I sat there and thought to myself, a voice came in my head. This voice told me how this was the wrong thing to do, that I have so much more going for me, and I can’t lose my life over some girl. 

So here I am, 3 days later. The girl and i have discussed what our relationship is going to be like. We are on a break as this is a time for me to focus and make myself happy. My happiness can’t be dependent on another person. That is unhealthy. I’ve started seeing a counselor and just doing more & staying active. I know In the end I can conquer these demons.

I would just like to say thank you to all of you who reached out to me that night. I obviously didn’t respond, but knowing that a random stranger online cares enough about another stranger to make sure they’re okay, well that is special to me. Thank you once again, and I hope every one in this sub finds some sort of happiness in their life. We all deserve it. This is a disease just like diabetes, and you should not be ashamed of it. Instead face it head on, and say “fuck you depression, I’m better than you.”"

cxnela,depression,"People don't realize that coming over and just sitting with you, watching tv or having food or whatever, while you're depressed is the best feeling.","I usually decline social events when I'm really depressed because who would want to be around a depressed person, right?

So, I'll stay home by myself, which makes me feel even more isolated and down. But it's not that I don't want to be around people. I just don't want to pretend all night that I'm this other person -- I do that all day at work; it's exhausting. 

But to have a good friend come over and just be there, just sit with you while you watch Tv, it just makes me feel loved, which helps chip away at the sadness just a little bit."
9ld1ak,depression,"Does anyone habitually say things like ""I fucking hate myself""","I've developed a habit of saying depressive thoughts out loud bc I'm always alone, always thinking them, and talk to myself when no one's looking.

Anyone else do this?"
hvgovi,depression,"Is it just me, or is it like you dont actually have a reason to be depressed but then just all of a sudden you are just overwhelmed in sadness?","I dont have a reason to be depressed but.

I guess it might be that my parents arent able to bring in no money and its just in my conscious and pops out evry now and then. Am i just faking my ""depression""? 

Let me know if im the only one that feels like this?

EDIT: I just want to say that i tried responding to all the messages but i just got overwhelmed and got busy with trying to help my dad with work. but thank you to everyone who gave me words kf encouragement and i am deeply sorry to everyone who feels the same way. oh and thank you kind person for my first gold award! :)

clue8y,depression,Realizing that you will die because of suicide is really hard.,"Sometimes it just really hits me that maybe not today or tomorrow but eventually I will commit suicide.

k0rvk5,depression,Forcing myself to do things makes me hate them. Doing nothing makes me hate myself.,"The first advice you see on googling depression is 'do things you used to enjoy!', right? Well, I've gotten really good at making myself do things. I make myself do my job. I make myself do a side hustle. I make myself read books and post about them on my blog. This month, I'm making myself do NaNoWriMo.   


I presume the idea is that, at some point, you start enjoying things again, but I haven't ever managed to get to that stage. I dread my side hustle. I never know what to say about books until I start writing. I write exactly the number of words I need to hit my goal and then I stop. I don't enjoy any of it. Some of it, I really hate. And I've been doing the side hustle for a year and five months, and the blog for two years, so it's not a matter of it 'give it time'. 

&#x200B;

I don't know how to make myself do things if I don't treat them as obligations. Anything optional, I just don't do. It feels like a vicious cycle where the only way to make myself do something also makes me hate it! Is there a way around this? Has anyone else felt this? I can't seem to find anything online that even mentions this being a problem, let alone actually proposing a solution. 

&#x200B;

I'm trying to make myself go for a walk every day, because that's supposed to be good for your mood, and it feels like an actual punishment."
jy2o4t,depression,"Having wonderful, loving, supportive family doesn’t make you any less depressed.","I have two extremely loving parents, a supportive sister, and a handful of close friends who I know would always listen if I needed it. I am still extremely depressed and ready to end it all. I attempted suicide 4 years ago, ended up in the psych ward for 2 weeks, and my family and friends visited every day. 

I can barely function anymore. I try so incredibly hard every day to be normal, to work, walk, chat, and appear fine. Mentally, I am thinking about killing myself for hours every day. Today I lost it, blew off work, and slept the entire day. I cried to my mother and she cried with me. Asked me what I needed, willing to do anything, but it doesn’t help. 

There isn’t anything wrong with me. I’m young, pretty, thin, and am capable of making friends and keeping them. I have a STEM degree, I’ve had committed relationships. None of that makes me happy. The true tragedy of my life is that I know I could do more, be more, and I just cant. 

I’ve been told I am strong because I haven’t done drugs or drank, because I powered through my degree, because I haven’t killed myself. I’m not strong, I’m guilted. Having a family who loves you and you love is a double edged sword. 

Love doesn’t cure depression. It does wrack you with guilt if you even think of attempting it. It would destroy my family. I’m not exaggerating. They have all told me individually, may times, that it would. My parents would never forgive themselves. I would haunt them forever.

I tried therapy. After I got out of the hospital I was on anti-depressants. I tried different meds, I saw 4 different therapists. It all just made it so much worse. One of my therapists almost got me involuntarily recommitted to the hospital. Her talking to my parents and ensuring they would be picking me up and taking me home was the only thing that saved me. 

Even the “good” therapists just made me feel worse. I would leave every appointment more depressed than I came in. I quit trying that after a year. The thing about therapy is that you are forced to lie. I was suicidal but couldn’t talk about it. If they suspect anything you get the cops called on you and they forces you into the prison that is the psych ward. They force medication on you, get you fired from your job, and destroy whatever remnants of a life you had. 

My mother is a certified grief councillor. She volunteers in hospice and regularly supports grieving people. She can’t help me. Talking to her is pointless. She will cry and beg me not to. It doesn’t make me feel better, just guilty.

All this rambling because the truth is that I am without hope. My family is dragging me through life. All the love in the world and it doesn’t make a fucking difference. Drugs, therapy, doesn’t matter. Depression is a death sentence and there is no cure. 

My only hope is to distance myself from them and one day just do it. Push them far enough away that they grieve me and move on. That way, killing myself won’t affect anyone.

Edit: thank you to people who are commenting. I am having a hard time finding words to reply to people. I dont really express myself easily.

Like, it's funny and relatable to see tweets and memes about how much depression sucks but it really does so much harm than good, doesn't it? I can't understand how this is just so commonplace. 

I laugh at them. Theyre funny. I see myself in them. And then for hours and days upon days I lock myself in my car with a vague numbness, ditching class or calling off work to just... what, stare off into a void and roll around uncomfortably in my drivers seat in a shitty parking lot, chew through a pack of cigarettes, and just try to settle down suicidal compulsions. I stare in the rearview mirror and gastation bathrooms for forty minutes trying to make sense of who's looking back and why the sight of that person makes my stomach churn. 

I don't sleep for days on end until I collapse. I lose weight in 7 pound intervals. The thoughts of being a fuck-up and how bad I would beat the shit out of myself if I met myself on the street just stew any time Im beside myself. It's so funny! So quirky and relatable! If this is relatable that's fucking tragic. Being a ball of despondency and wanting to break my bones with a baseball bat is something I want everyone to laugh at with me. 

It's three am here and I'm just having a cigarette in an empty bathroom tub because I don't wanna think about anything. I wish there was a way to turn brains off. Medications haven't worked and I don't like being medicated at all anyway. It feels like hitting a plaster wall anytime I try to feel anything. Sure is loads of fun."

I can barely hold a conversation anymore. When I do talk, I stutter/stammer/mispronounce words. My mind blanks out a lot and my attention span is nonexistent. 

I used to be a really smart kid. Performed very well on the SAT despite having awful grades due to feeling indifferent about school. Then after high school, I became a full blown hypochondriac along with having generalized/social anxiety as well. 2 years ago I felt like I was THE man, and today I feel like an incompetent moron who becomes less functional each day. I think I’m recovering from my anxiety disorders, but I sometimes wonder if I’m actually just normalizing them, causing the illusion of recovery.

I don’t know where to go. I’ve really been trying to get better but I feel like I go two steps forward and three steps back. Can anyone else relate to this? Currently typing this out standing in the shower, feeling pretty down right now.

g1jxci,depression,Perhaps what's worse than depression is not being able to realize if you're having the best time of your life or the worst because it all feels the same.,"I'm having a really hard time keeping up with life, especially since the lockdown started.

That is not to say that I'm unhappy and miserable, what I'm saying is that happiness and sadness has become the same thing for me. I just can't separate the two. On top of that, there's this feeling of guilt I keep having about everything. I *am* from a rich family, people have always expected me to be on top of everything ever since I learned to walk, but I was never able to be on top. I've always sucked at everything. I tried to be on top, but never made it. And so now I'm this 21 year old uni student. And I've been hammered so much with that mindset of trying to get to be best at everything, and since I've always failed at that, I feel safer as a failure. I just *do not* feel that I want to succeed. I've become an emotional masochist. Sometimes I imagine that a loved one would come and choke me to death to put me out of this misery and leave me in a cold dead end where no one would ever come across again. That's not to say I'm suicidal. I am *not*. I just like having those kinds of imaginations. The only thing I do to keep my mind off of these feelings these days is that I listen to music. Even my genres are New Age, or shoegazing or doom metal, which used to be uplifting epic music. Now I'm not going too much into that stuff, but I hope I've made my point clear. I'm not looking for concrete advice. Perhaps simply writing these down and sharing might help me a lot. Thank you for taking the time to read through this whole post. 
I truly appreciate it."
lpab4d,depression,passively suicidal?,"does anyone else find themselves constantly just thinking about dying or disappearing and just not wanting to exist but also not committed enough to end things? 

like I find nearly nothing redeeming about my life - I know there's good in it but it's just not enough anymore - so I just daydream about dying so I don't have to pretend to be okay anymore. I'm not planning to kill myself, but I find myself wishing I could because this disinterested floating through life is just pointless"
d2pnl8,depression,I had a personality once but now I can't remember who i am,"J remember i used to be funny. I used to laugh and make jokes. I remember being able to hold a conversation with people. I wanted to know people and give back. I was shy but querky,  talkative and funny around people who knew me. 

Now I'm nothing. I don't seem to laugh or smile anymore. 

I feel numb and unsatisfied with everything I do.

EDIT: wow thank you everyone for your responses. I thought this post would go unanswered honestly but its so comforting and reassuring to know that I'm not alone. We just have to find the strength from somewhere to keep going on. 


On a side note..

I'm not sure if anyone else feels like this but.. I sometimes think part of the reason is I have this intense fear of losing people. So much in fact that i start believing In  the values and hobbies of the people in my life in the hopes they'll like me  and not leave. I just agree and comply with everything. I've done this for so long I just don't know who I am anymore."

emnl5m,depression,I feel like mental illness is the only medical condition where people wished they had cancer instead,"If I had cancer, I could say I needed time off work and everyone would be understanding. I could apply for and receive disability. 

I could freely tell my patients I was gone for 3 months or whatever bc I was doing chemo. 

No one would suggest that I dont need medicine bc Jesus died for my sins. 

I could be slow at work and my coworkers wouldn't think I'm lazy. They'd understand the physical toll cancer inflicts. 

People would rally around me. I could post about my journey on Facebook without shame. 

When I fall apart over small things people like to one up mentor tell me I dont have it bad at all. My health problems would be validated. 

Most importantly I wouldn't feel this terrible soul crushing desire to die.

Edit: thanks for all the responses! Let me rephrase something here. I dont wish I had cancer. I wish people treated depression as seriously as cancer. I'm not trying to diminish the pain cancer causes."

hqw1wy,depression,I wish I could donate my life to someone who actually deserves it,"A while ago I got into an argument with a guy because he implied that I was immature for complaining about being in college. He said, ""don't forget you're taking up space in a class someone else would love to be taking."" Even before I heard that, I felt like I was a waste of space and resources, but that of all things just made it so much worse somehow. I've wasted pretty much every gift I've been given and all I want is to die in peace but I can't even do that.

ce7tl7,depression,"Cheers to everyone on here, this sub is the only place I feel accepted. We may be depressed, but we are never dicks to one another or reject each other's voices.","Whenever someone posts something wholesome, everyone cheers for them. Nobody is envious or salty of seeing others get better.  
&nbsp;

Whenever someone posts something depressing, everyone comforts them. Nobody one-ups one another. This sub's etiquette is the epitome of ""Always be nice to people, but if you have nothing nice to say, then don't say anything at all.""  
&nbsp;

On other subs like AskReddit, whenever I post a question, it'll always get downvoted right away. I seriously don't care about karma, I just wish my questions become visible because I'm genuinely curious. My questions are usually something like, ""People who manage to get their life together, how did you do it?"".  
&nbsp;

I ask those questions because I'm looking for hope. I try not to make them sound negative but they'll always get downvoted. That makes me feel like I'm not allowed to hear something wholesome. It's like I'm being denied hope.  
&nbsp;

On this sub, it is normal for a post to have 2K upvotes, and stays 99% upvoted, if not 100%. Posts that don't take of, and only have 1 default upvote will usually stay 100% upvoted. So that means the people here very rarely downvote anything. If they're not upvoting it, they just leave it be. We use the upvote and downvote for what they're meant to.  
&nbsp;

r/depression is not a community in the same sense that r/<put hobby here> is a community (we're not striving to be good at being depressed, we just want it to stop), but this sub is a comforting place despite its depressive nature.

dkx9yc,depression,I (attempted) suicide by crashing my car into a highway median at 200 km/h and walked out with a minor concussion. I feel like it's a sign I need to step up my action against depression. What are some things I can do to alleviate my depression?,"The title and this story may sound fake (New account to hopefully protect my identity), but I swear to you it could not be more real for me. I wanted to share this, I am not doing this for attention but merely to seek help. More questions will be asked at the end of my story.  As the title describes, a miracle has occurred given the severity and intent of the crash. The paramedics, police, doctors, nurses and my parents all gave me the most puzzled look of their lives when they asked how fast I was going, and I replied ""200 km/h"".

I have been depressed for 4 years now. Nothing has been working and my mental health has declined terribly. I have been on multiple medications, tried behavioural therapy such as cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), and even went a course of Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). First my motivation to do anything went down; I couldn't eat, do school work and most importantly, socialize. My social circle grew smaller as my depression grew bigger, after 4 years of suffering as well as other health conditions such as horrible eyesight (+10.00 in each eye with astigmatism), sleep apnea and anxiety, I figured life wasn't going to get any better and I decided to end my life.

I drove to the mountains where I decided I would find a large hill, go full speed down it and either turn into the median or drive off the road, ultimately killing myself. About 3 hours from my hometown I found the perfect hill, The road was steep, perfect for gaining speed to ensure a fatal crash. Without thinking too much (I would just talk myself out and not commit), I pulled a U-turn and drove to the hill which was about 5 minutes after that point. They say your life flashes before your eyes, mine played back to me for those 5 minutes. The most important people and influential moments of my life appeared before my eyes. They suddenly disappeared as I approached my chosen hill. My foot automatically floored the gas pedal, I placed my left foot behind the brake so I wouldn't back out. I raced down the hill, gaining more and more speed, by the time I reached the bottom, my car (which only has a speedometer for up to 200 km/h. I saw the road start to bend and I jerked my wheel into the opposite direction of the turn, slamming the front end of the car into the median. That was the last thing I remembered before waking up in my car, with tapping on the window from bystanders. All I could think to myself at that moment was ""wow, I so much of a failure I can't even kill myself"". A bystander described to the paramedics and police that I hit the median, did about 10 spins (no flips) and then continued to scrape median down the hill for another 250m. I got a glimpse of my car before I was taken away in an ambulance, it was completely destroyed. When I arrived to the hospital I was placed in the trauma room however, the doctor was incredibly surprised after seeing me sitting upright with consciousness after a 200 km/h car accident. He assessed me and ordered a full-body CT scan. The results came back clean, no bleeding, no broken bones and most importantly, no death. He then admitted me to the psychiatry ward (which I won't get into on this post but it was a nightmare!!!).

The everyone's surprise I was barely injured, walking away with a concussion with memory loss at most. This phrase really stuck in my mind because nearly every person I have talked to so far has said: ""It's a miracle you're alive"". I'm not religious, but I agree, it is a miracle I'm alive, and I""m not going to waste it. I'm begging for help because I know this community loves to help people when they reach out. I really want to try and beat my depression but I don't know how. I have tried CBT, I'm going BACK to ECT for another round of treatment and I'm on increased medication. I will be seeing counsellors and psychiatrists, however thanks to Canadian healthcare not until 2020 (which is one of the reasons I decided to end it, due to lack of resources).

If anyone out there has any tips on how to manage severe depression and anxiety please let me know. I'm still alive today despite the severity of the crash, and I believe it's a sign that I need to conquer this depression and do something great with my life. I am tired of laying at home, with no energy and no motivation, wasting away my life every day with my depression. I can personally say even those who are suiciding don't want to die, they merely just want to stop existing.

Please help with any advice you have, I'm begging for my life to change, please. I am trying my best to push past my depression and suicidal thinking so I can give life another try.

Here are a list of specific questions that would benefit a lot:

\-How do I keep up my motivation despite having no energy all the time?

\-How can I keep up or have more energy?

\-I'm thinking of going back to school for Nursing, my current position (lab tech) doesn't feel fulfilling and I'm looking for something more. Is nursing school a good idea or will that just make my life more stressful?)

\-What are some habits I could do to alleviate my depression

\-Any secret self-help/feel good tips?

\-How do I make more friends and build a better support network?

\-What do I tell to my friends who have noticed I just ""disappeared"" for a few days?

&#x200B;

Thanks to those who took the time to read this post, I usually get little to no reads on Reddit but I thought I'd share this anyway since not many people can say they survived a 200 km/h automobile suicide attempt and walked out with minor injuries. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.

Edit: more questions

Edit 2: Thank you, everyone, for taking the time to write to me. I truly didn't believe this would reach this many people. I will try and reply/read everyones post but I am still in the process of seeing a lot of specialists. But I am truly grateful for all the love and support that has been sent my way. Thank you, I will make you all proud and try my best to implement all of the tips into my life."
ix5il7,depression,Beirut Explosion ended me,"First off I'm a lebanese 24 years old and You can't imagine the life I'm living here. Our house got destroyed in the beirut explosion and my dad got injured. 

My mom is sick (multiple sclerosis) and We can't afford her medication anymore. 


Depression, Fear and anxiety everyday. Our country is run by corrupted politicians who ruled for 30 years. No one is able to let them go (they have weapons) ... 

I've been unemployed for more than 1 year. 
My father is unemployed too. 

We did a revolution that survived for 5 months but since corona happened it turned off and not one politician was convicted. 

To make it easy to understand our situation , There is no dollars in our country anymore only lebanese money. All our savings in the banks is gone. We became poor. 70% unemployement , everything is expensive ... Imagine Vanezuella but ten times worse .. 

We are stuck in a war between Israel and Hezbollah. We are innocent educated people who speak 3 languages !! I have a license in physical therapy which I got and cost me 25 thousand dollars and it's useless. My father is an accountant who worked so hard and now our savings is gone! There is no fucking dollars anymore! 

I'm doing physiotherapy volunteer work but now it's starting to do more bad for my mental health than good. I'm working 8hours and getting payed 0. I'm angry every morning about this and specially before sleeping

I'm just done. I'm really lost and I can't get out of this country with no savings and if it wasn't for my parents I would have ended my life a long time ago.

j1158l,depression,"no identity, no personality","Does anybody else feel like they 'are just there'?

I feel like there is no depth to me. I have no interests anymore, everything feels like a chore. I don't feel like a real person, only a spectator - I am here, but not really. I have no personality. I pick up some traits I see in others, or on TV. I feel like I am just a mix of various people I've considered interesting, and I just impersonate and mimic them. I just live and do what others want me to do. I feel like an empty shell. I daydream all the time, and sometimes feel like I am losing touch with reality. Sometimes I can't recall what my face looks like, all I see are parts of it, and it feels unfamiliar and uncomfortable. 

I have no idea what is going on with me. I've been growing more and more suicidal each day. I just wish I could feel okay for a moment."
l02zo4,depression,I’ve been staying up until 5am playing video games and then sleeping until 3-4pm everyday,"I have no desire to get up earlier and do something with my day even though if I could force myself I’d probably feel better. 

It starts to get dark within an hour of waking up usually and it’s so depressing but it keeps me isolated in my “comfort zone” 

Being up in the middle of the night feels freeing for some reason, no one awake, no guilt for responsibilities, I can sleep away the day and not feel guilty about it.

But I’m wasting time and I want more than anything to feel okay again. I want to start to get my life back to something that I can derive some genuine enjoyment out of and move forward with productive things. 

I became depressed again about 10 months ago since my mom passed and these past 10 months have gone by so fast, I’m almost 26 and I’m scared at how fast time is moving without any stability forming in my life. 

TLDR: I’m 25 and I feel like I’m wasting time, which I am. But it’s so hard to even attempt to start getting my life in order. 

It feels so far out of reach"

Edit: why did this post blow up this was just a depressive vent post

Edit 2: why is this being given wholesome awards reddit baffles me sometimes

Edit 3: I feel like I should add some context to my depression that may differ from your own experience. My depression mainly comes from a place of self-loathing  and my own inability to accept myself. I have people who I care about and who care about me but I feel like depression has manifested into my personality and it is a part of who I am now.

I’m going to adopt a do or die attitude and this will end either with me ending myself or something beautiful. I’m going to apply for every job under the sun.

lnrzv6,depression,The fact that I'm supposed to keep living and I'm not allowed to kill myself annoys me honestly.,"If I don't wanna keep going why should I? I had no choice in my birth and I don't have a choice really in my death either. I mean I could off myself but no one would really respect my choice. I don't know, I don't get much joy out of life. I never really had much of a chance to, I get some but I don't know if it's worth going on and on forever. I hate all of the obligations there are to stay alive. I stay alive mostly for other people, I know that's important. I wish I could be selfish and die. I used to think growing up that once my parents both died I'd just kill myself too, I feel like that might still be a good plan for me. 

I have goals and desires, as well as things I want to do. But I also don't really enjoy life. This is all selfish I'm aware. Perhaps it's wrong of me to think this way but I feel resentment towards my existence. Resentment towards the obligations and feelings I hold towards others. Resentment of my love for them and their love for me. I daydream about becoming a major asshole to everyone, just so I can off myself and have people celebrate my death. But I also can't bring myself to be a jerk."

Fade away from everywhere and become nothingness. All your sorrows and misery, agony gone in the blink of an eye. And you know what's the best part? It's free! You don't need to pay to kill yourself, but you need to pay to live. It's the easy way out, the only beautiful way out. It's not much, we all die at some point wouldn't hurt to cut myself off from everything as I would lose my consciousness.  

But I am here to live for the mental well being of other people, so they don't be sad. I suffer for them. Yet they wouldn't take a minute to listen to one of those millions of thoughts I have ruining my head. Ironic."
iot9f4,depression,"I think about suicide everyday, but I’m not planning it","Why does my brain constantly resort to wanting to kill myself? Every single day that’s my answer, I want to get it out of my head because I feel like if it continues for too long I may do something.
I have nothing planned, I just think about it all the time. Why is this?"
fvcm3g,depression,Does anyone else feel like being depressed is just part of them? and its something that they will never be able to change about themselves or 'cure'?,"I literally cannot remember a time in my life where I wasn't angry or unhappy with myself or how people treated me. I've had body issues since I was 8 years old because my grandparents overfed me and let me eat sweets all day, which led to me being outcasted by my peers and constantly criticised by my parents. I first started thinking about suicide when I was maybe 12 or 13 and 10 years later I still think about it. I don't think I've ever has a solid year of my life where I've thought that everything was going to be okay and life was worth living. I've had months of temporary relief from the constant pain, but thats all they were; temporary. I thought finding someone to spend my life with and who loves me unconditionally and puts up with my suicidal tantrums would fix me but it hasn't. I thought effectively curing my disfiguring autoimmune disease would help me have a new lease on life, but it hasn't. I have lots of friends, an attractive face, and I had a job I liked. No body in my personal life except for two people know that I struggle, and the rest would never guess it. I have nothing to be sad about, really, I have an objectively easy life. But that doesn't matter, I am depressed and I always will be. I could have the perfect body, my dream job, have millions in my bank account and I'd still feel exhausted. In the same way that people say 'once an addict, always an addict', I've come to believe the same thing about my depression."
lce9ou,depression,Holy fucking shit I can’t stop beating myself up over past mistakes,"I think of a name, a face, a place, a year—the only things I can recollect are negative. I’ll just be driving in the car or sitting in my room, then these thoughts hit me like a fucking locomotive: “Remember that stupid weird shit you said 6 years ago?” Or “remember that group of people whom you tried to befriend earlier in freshman year of college only to be rejected, and you didn’t really care for them much anyways but holy fuck, you are so dysfunctional and weird and retarded?” It goes on, “remember how you chose to not talk to that cute girl who showed clear-as-the-fucking-day signs of interest in you but still opted to not talk to because you’re that brain dead and insecure?”
It doesn’t stop. It never fucking does. It’s like I’m haunted by my relatively uneventful past. I involuntarily think of these social/romantic/academic/attention-deficit/practical failures, and then I think of how great it would be if I could just roll over and die, never mind how. No more mistakes. No more disappointments. I’m tired, I’m tired of being tired, and I’m tired of being tired of being. I’m not suicidal, yet at the same time, I feel like I’m just one bad day from doing myself in; however, I could never do that to my friends and family. It’s a weird fucking feeling. I don’t normally post here... Thanks for coming to my TED Talk on Stupid Bullshit.

j2kjtx,depression,I made it.,"Yesterday I went to a clinic because of my injured leg. While I was talking to my doctor about my injury, suddenly I had an urge to talk about what I’ve been feeling for the past 5 years. It took a lot of courage since I never talked to any adults about it because I was too anxious and scared. I cried, my hands were shaking and I couldn’t really talk properly but what I knew was I finally seek a proper treatment. I knew I was depressed and the doctor diagnosed me with it. I’m only 18 years old this year and I’m currently studying at college right now. I’m embarrassed when I remember the way I broke down in front of the doctor. But I did. I finally talked."

hjerm3,depression,Depression turned me into an idiot.,"I used to be quite a bright kid, at least, according to what everyone said. After years of trauma and abuse, however, depression completely overcame my life, and after so long, I feel it has utterly destroyed my brain; fried it, like an overloaded computer. I genuinely forget how old I am sometimes. I struggle doing basic math. My short-term memory has deteriorated to nothing. Etc. I just feel as though I'm slowing down only more each passing day.

In the past two weeks, wrestling my inner demons, I lost so much weight and have lost so much mental curiosity and interest I used to possess. But recently, after watching Being Erica as some of you recommended, I realized that ""no matter where you run, you just end up running into yourself."" I suppose regrets will come in different forms, no matter what I do or try, the outcome would be the same that I'd be short of what I desire to be. To be honest, I don't know what a solution could be here, but I suppose seeking it is part of that endless struggle. "

jp1zmd,depression,I'm just saying I've never been thankful that I didn't kill myself,"Ever since my first suicidal thoughts when I was like 14 (22 now) people say ""aren't you so thankful you're still here?""



No. The answer is always no. I've never once thought I'm glad I didn't do it. I've only ever regretted NOT doing it. If I had just acted on my first suicidal impulses or any of them after I'd have been so much better off. Not a thing has happened I should've cared about missing.



My life has only gotten so so much worse. Now I WISH I felt how I did when I first felt suicidal. That was roses compared to this shit and I actively wanted to die then too. My life has gotten so much more fucked up than i could've ever thought then, and I really only would've missed out on suffering.



I've only been alive because 1. Suicide is way harder than people think and 2. I'm supposed to and guess what?


I'm not thankful for it. Jesus Christ do I wish I had just killed myself 8 years ago or *any* time since. I've never once been thankful for not killing myself"

Edit: this is not what I expected. Thank you to all these wonderful strangers for the support. In the real world, only my partner knows that I even have depression because I don’t want to stress people out. I’m honestly so overwhelmed. I thought I would answer some common questions in an edit, and I’ll slowly get to each comment as I can 😊. Firstly the cost- I’m an Aussie and I have private health insurance, which includes ambulance cover, so it cost me nothing. I can’t believe some people have to pay. I wouldn’t have called if I knew I did. Second - what happened after I called. I had my live in boyfriend with me, and they came in and asked me some questions (eg had I overdosed / self harmed etc.) I explained that I had accidentally missed a few days of my medication, and then had several extremely stressful incidents occur over the space of the days I forgot them. I called because I started to feel like I couldn’t trust my brain, and I had a plan I was worried I would act on when my partner left for work in the morning. I had also had a panic attack right before I called, which I had never had before and oh boy was that scary. So off I went. It was all very gentle and calm. I basically just needed someone to watch me while I waited it out / for my meds to kick in. I slept in a nice room, was allowed to keep my phone so I keep in touch with my partner. In the morning I was given my meds (I had remembered them the dish before). I had various meeting were they explained that they were happy I called, it was just a relapse, forgetting my meds didn’t help. I had a long meeting with a doctor where I went through everything (I was first diagnosed 5 years ago with PTSD and depression) and the difficulties I’ve had getting help. I had a good doctor for a while, but she moved. So they set me up with a new doctor with hours the work in my work schedule, and a new therapist, again that work in my work schedule (most psychs in my area that bulk bill don’t do after 9-5) (bulk bill = in Australia medical services and partially covered by our public health system (Medicare) is the doctor only charges what they cover, it’s referred to bulk billing. Basically it’s free (but covered by your tax dollars)) They also renewed my mental health care plan (my document a doctor gives that allows me to access the psyc services at little to no cost) which I hadn’t been able to renew as my new doctor couldn’t fit me in. Lastly I was put in touch with a community mental health program a few streets from me who have given me a case worker. I haven’t meet her yet, but basically she’ll contact me regularly to see if I’m ok, and can be the person to find me doctors and psychologists when I’m struggling too. I’ve nicknamed her my depression pa. Lastly they recommended I get my dosage upped a little bit. Then I was realised (it was about lunch time) and got sushi. They also rang my boyfriend a lot (plus me texting him a selfie every 30 minutes on his request) to keep him updated, and to run down my plan moving forward."

fmfemk,depression,I'm a 13 year old boy who is abused and need help,"I'm 13 years old and I live with my dad. I'm shared custody from my mom to my dad. My dad is very abusive towards me. I've been diagnosed with depression and PTSD and I've gone to the hospital twice over suicide attempts because every time I'm with my dad I want to kill myself. He pushes me to the limit and I'm afraid that. 

Ever since I was  little, my dad has always beaten me with a belt. Even before I was old enough for school. My dad has beaten me for not doing what I was told to do. He yells curse words at me and uses my mother as an example of what not to be. And that makes me feel sad because I miss my mom. Recently, my grades dropped. I've been having problems at school. I have a hard time focusing and paying attention to what I'm being taught. My dad was pissed. One moment he’s screaming at me and cursing me out and telling me I won't achieve anything in life. And telling me I'm going to regret it when he’s done with me.

My 11 year old brother also made a bad grade, so he walked into my brothers room and I heard screaming and loud sound from my dad hitting him with a belt. Then he walked up to me and told me to give him my hand. I held my hand out and he hit me extremely hard with the belt. I screamed and held my hand, but he told me to hold my hand out again he continue to do it over and over again.

Then he told both of us to come in the kitchen. He started yelling at us saying he was in an ""ass whooping mood"" and that he'd beat us whenever we felt like it. That if we didn't care about our grades he wouldn't care either. That he'd make us feel his pain. He hit me extremely hard. My hand was red and swollen. I had a bruise on my wrist that was slightly swollen and stung to the touch. He told me to hurry and wash the dishes before he'd do it again. And he did. But my hand hurt too badly. He threatened to hold me down.

I'm going to kill myself if I have to continue to live with him. I cannot take this anymore and no one will do anything about it, I decided that when I go back to my mom's on Sunday I am refusing to go back to my dad's. This is what it's come to because he refuses to cooperate and my mom doesn't have enough money to get a lawyer and free legal aid takes too long. So I am not going. I know my dad will call the police if I don't go. When they come, I will talk to them and tell them my situation.

Can they force me to go? What will they do? Because in order to get me to go they would have to physically drag me. I am in fear of my life and I don't want to die but he just pushes me to that limit so I just can't be around him. I don't know how many times I've tried to tell my dad this and even my therapists have tried to tell him this.

He doesn't care, he simply denies treating me the way he does saying he's never called me the things he does on a daily basis like dumbass, idiot, son of a b\*\*\*, and he even calls my brother those things and denies it. Then when we're in public or around other people he acts like a totally sweet person, and his girlfriend thinks that I'm the problem because he constantly complains about me when really it's just a big show.

What will the cops do about it when they come?"

I have few positive memories. Im tired and I dont want to do keep trying anymore. Everything ive tried never has worked. Meditation. CBT. Psychologists. Psychiatrists. Medication. Sleeping Pills. Weed.

I feel so young (because I havent literally done much at all with my depression+anxiety) but ancient at the same time. I have no passions, no interests. No goals. Havent had good friends in years. Virgin. I dont go out. I dont take photos, I dont use social media. I feel like I dont exist. I dont even have a fucking job now. Never had a boyfriend.

Literally the only thing Ive done is graduate university and I cant even get a fucking job.

Ive struggled in everything ive ever done. School. Hobbies. Uni. Work. Job Applications. Appearance.

The only time ive ever been hit on is at clubs. I just hate seeing other people my age succeed and do well in life. Even people who are 17-18, have had more experiences then me. I hardly go out. Ive spent 90% of time at home alone with my elderly parents. 

I try so hard, but Im still a loser and I hate it. Im not introverted and I just hate how my life has become. I hate it..I do. I feel like I must be such damaged goods that its too late to get better. These last 6 years in particular have flown and Im just so fucking done.

Its not like Ive tried. For 2 years Ive tried joining groups, volunteering etc to improve my situation but i get nowhere. No one wants a bar of me.

ih6eox,depression,I’m 20 but in my head I feel like I’m 16,"I’m 20 but I feel exactly the same as when I was 16. It’s so frustrating and pathetic. There’s so many things I’ve missed out from what other teenagers would experience and I’m just never going experience those things in the same way. Like having a crush in school/sixth form/college. Waiting for their classes to finish so you can see them, spending time together in between lessons, studying with each other, catching the bus together then doing it again the next day"
ed99oq,depression,Somebody noticed I am not ok,"Went to a doctor today because I suffered an injury while drunk.

The doctor (God bless him, amazing person) saw right through me and asked if I was Ok. Actually pretty much told me I'm not Ok mentally. Asked what happened to me, how do I feel, why do I drink. Gave me recommendations to a psychiatrist (for drinking) and to a psychologist.

It was nice for somebody to notice and to be so kind and interested. It was way beyond his job description.

I'm a bit sorry I opened up only in the most generic terms, but I was already on the verge of tears.

Unfortunately ppl close to me are oblivious even if I'm giving all the signs. They get annoyed with me if I don't wear my happy face, but I can not bear to put it on anymore.

God, I hope I can take something from this doctor and try one last time to fix myself, because I can't live like this anymore."

9au31d,depression,Do you ever feel guilty that your parents got stuck with such an incompetent failure?,"I think about it a lot. My mom has a friend of hers who has 2 kids. One is in an Ivy League school and the other is going to a nice university. They both get good grades, have a social life, and know where they're going in life. 

Meanwhile my mom got stuck with a total wastoid that sits around all day on his phone. I don't drive, don't have a job, don't really wash myself unless it's been a few days or I have to go out somewhere. I have severe ADHD and don't really do well taking basic classes. I just feel so guilty that this is what my mom gets to deal with. She always tells me about how it was such a magical moment when I was first born. And I just think ""if only she knew how I would turn out."" It wasn't her fault, though. She is such a loving caring person. She didn't deserve this. 

Anytime my dad comes home from work I have trouble even looking him in the eye because I know I'm probably such a disappointment in his eyes. I act normal around him but the anxiety and dread is always there in the background. I wish I could just kill myself and end the bullshit, but that would just hurt them even more. No matter what I do, everybody loses. "

l50p1h,depression,"Each month that passes I feel sadder and sadder. Please, somebody read me.","Hello.

Ever since I was little, I've been very emotional. As time has passed and I've been able to understand better the world around me, I find disgust. I dislike how everything is money and manipulation and how you can't do anything if you don't play along. My family is broken and I can't share my feelings with anybody, and when I do is usually with my mother and she always makes me feel worse, or guilty about everything. I feel like an idiot.

I used to go to therapy before the pandemic, it was quite good but sadly my doctor passed away due to old age. I'm not in a place right now where I can pay therapy. I'm also not motivated. I just want everything to end. I want to stop being me. I don't want these memories anymore.  


Thanks for getting until the end."

e9uflv,depression,I'm tired of being everyone's therapist when no one will give me ten serious minutes of their time.,"I've had a bunch of stuff happen to me in the past month. I got appendicitis and surgery; still recovering. Accidentally twisted my ankle. I got a cold, which I'm still fighting. However, none of that seemed to be enough for people to give me a break from emotional labor; they demand it from me 24/7, practically. Not asking for advice, really just ranting. These are just a few examples.

I had my sister calling me talking about her boyfriend who just drinks all the time and does nothing, and she was complaining about how she hates where she works. I tell her to get rid of the man and get a job somewhere else. It wasn't as short as it sounds. I listened to her and gave her serious advice, though I know she won't take it because she never does. Instead of thanking me, no one ever does, she tells me that it's easy for me to tell her to just get another job because I don't have one and can just sit around and sleep. Well, thanks, I just love sitting around and thinking about my crappy life; it is a positive joy. We hadn't spoken until her son ended up in an issue and, of course, the family therapist (me) gets a text, asking me to talk to her son and try to get him to listen to ""reason"". I agree just because I know my nephew doesn't get good support from her. Come to find out, she's mad because he's dating some girl who has a kid already. I can't say it's great at his age, but he's also an adult, so I just told him to be careful, watch out for emotional abuse, and reminded him of his last relationship, which was like a copy of his mom's relationships; she doesn't realize he gets his bad examples from her. After talking to him, his mom texts me and is like, ""I'm getting off work in a few hours, I'll call and we can do a three-way call and talk to him."" Nowhere did she ASK me if this was okay, didn't ask if I was busy or anything, but as with most of my family, since I'm at home, I never have anything important to do, so they just tell me to do stuff instead of asking, like I'm a human being. I tell her I texted him and I was still recovering and needed to sleep. She didn't ask me what I was recovering from, if I was okay, nothing. Just said, ""Okay, night."" 

My niece had trouble at school and she's a lot like my sister, unable to let go of things. She's upset because some girl at school wants to fight her because my niece took her chair. A chair this girl wasn't using, mind you, but that was just sitting next to her. My niece calls me, upset and frantic over this because the girl won't let it go and went to the office and had my niece called out of class because the girl wanted an apology. My niece refused because she said she hadn't even done anything and she went to the principal, who told her that the girl is known for ""keeping things going"", so she wouldn't be bothered again, but my niece wouldn't get off the phone until I promised to stay up until she got out of school in case they call her into the office again and she wanted me to talk to them. A huge reason I don't have kids is so I don't have to deal with the stress of dealing with teachers and other parents, yet I have to be a parent to my niece because my sister won't be. Mind you, I had just come back from the doctor, had been hopped up on pain meds and wanted to do nothing, but sleep. I forced myself to stay awake, but thankfully, no one called.

Then, my sister calls me and is crying, telling me how much she wants her boyfriend to leave the house. So, I don't say anything and just let her talk. Finally, she's like, ""I just don't know what to do or how to get him out of my house."" I told her to call the police; she doesn't want to get him in any more trouble because he has a DUI because he drinks and drives. SHE allows him to drink and drive her car, because he doesn't have one and doesn't have a license. I won't even touch how stupid that is. So, I get frustrated with her and tell her that I keep telling her how to get rid of him and she never listens, so I don't know what she wants me to do. She acts like I offended her and is like, ""I just called to vent, can't I vent, sometimes?"" I tell her that she can, but I'm tired of getting calls almost every week about this man; I'm not her therapist or life coach or anything, I'm barely hanging on by a thread a lot of days and hearing about this situation distresses me because, even if I don't like her very much, I don't want to hear about anyone dealing with this type of stuff. Not to mention, her best friend was killed just a few months ago by her boyfriend who was abusive and drunk a lot... make him leave before he gets to that point. Anyway, she accuses me of making it about me and hangs up. Maybe I did make it about me, but I want people to understand that I am not a therapist and I cannot fix their issues and I'm not emotionally well enough to take on all this stuff. I'm not sure anyone is, tbh.

Finally, we come to today. My mother had to take me to the doctor because I couldn't get there on my own and need support to get there. We're talking about normal stuff, then she's like, ""Aren't you tired of just sitting at home and doing nothing? You really need to get out and get a life."" I don't ever like talking to my mom about my mental health because she acts like it's a phase that should have been over in my teens and she doesn't understand why I'm ""letting it bother me"" as an adult. I'd like to mention, she has horrible anxiety, as well, but she powers through it to work, at least, it still takes over her life. She also doesn't do much outside of the house and has no life, but when I point that out, she brings it back to me. Anyway, I tell her I just paid all the bills and since the bills got higher, I don't have money to have a life, even if I wanted to. So, then, she's like, ""If you get a job, you'd have more money."" I know this, but I have tried many times to hold a job; I cannot do it for more than a few days without having panic attacks and breakdowns, which either end up with me leaving or getting let go, which then leads me into a deep depression. She acts like I don't try and this is even with medicine and therapy. Sometimes, I'm sure the main reason none of this works is because I'm around my family, but I never tell them that because I don't want to deal with that fallout. At this point, I'm just tired of the conversation, so I don't respond. Then, she brings up how I need to get some friends, at least... says the woman who literally has one friend and who got upset at my aunt for going out without her, even though she never goes anywhere when she invites her. Heavy eyeroll. Anyway, I tell her that I've tried to have friends; it's not my fault they don't put effort in and either they end up not talking or I fade out because nothing is happening. She asks me why I don't hang out with the people I met last summer. The two girls I met last summer were nice, but one would rarely go out with us because she would rather stay in with her boyfriend, which left me and the other girl. We hung out a few times, but then she got a new trivia group and stopped texting me back, so I stopped texting her and let that fade out. This happens too often, so I stopped trying to make friends. I tell my mom that I don't talk to them anymore, and she's like, ""That's your problem, you don't try and cut people off so quickly."" I texted the second girl every day for a week; she wasn't working at the time and she was always posting snaps, so I knew she was available, I wasn't going to keep texting for no reason. I try to have boundaries and get crapped on for them. Unfortunately, I am not one of those people who will keep trying and trying and trying when I see things obviously aren't going along, anymore. She then goes into this long story about how she met her only friend and how they only talk like once a month, but they are still good friends and I need to be more ""realistic"" with friends. What good is a friend whom I only talk to for 10 minutes once a month and hang out with, maybe once every three months? If that works for her, great, but that's not ""getting a life"" or anything else. Plus, I have a history of getting friends and then I become the ""therapy friend"" and I fade away because all they ever do is come around to dump their problems on me and get advice, then I don't hear from them for months, when something else is going wrong. That's not friendship, to me. 

And go back to my mom and my aunt. My aunt is mad at my mom for ""checking up on her"" at her age and, of course, I get pulled into it because my mom is being childish and won't talk to my aunt, so I've been designated the go-between, but I never said I would be. They are 20+ years older than me, why am I even in this?

I don't know. I'm just tired of being everyone's therapist and mediator. I keep trying to explain how draining it is. They obviously see I have my own issues, but they continually pour their issues onto me, expect sincere, helpful, empathetic responses, but let me feel bad or need something and everyone is busy or doesn't answer their phones or I get ""advice"" that isn't helpful. My niece and nephew would probably talk, but I don't want to burden them with my issues; their mother does that to them enough, and they complain about it, to me, of course. What is it about me that makes everyone think I'm a therapist? Plus, none of them pay me for my services. That probably makes me more upset than anything; if I was a real therapist, I'd probably be rich off all these ""sessions"", lol."

Im so tired. I’m so tired of existing. I’m so tired of being mad. I’m so tired of being tired. It’s pathetic. I’m a 25 year old adult who’s stuck living at home with my family. I can feel myself falling apart and I’m reaching the point where I’m finally just going to take myself out of this shitty game called life, or I’m going to end up cutting ties all together with my family, which is where I’ll probably sink. If it’s sink or swim out in the big world. 


I am holding on to so many grudges. From so many years. That I clearly can’t cope with in a healthy way. My heart hurts so much but I’m such a glutton for punishment that I can’t bring myself to stop carrying around all this hate. And it is absolutely one hundred percent consuming me alive. I’ll try and use brackets to section off my thoughts since I doubt anybody cares enough to actually read this all the way through. 



 {My thoughts on my father}

{{{{As an adult now. I realize that I spent probably the first 18 years of my life. Living in literal fear of my pseudo racist father. I still remember being 6 years old or so and hearing my mother scream for my brother because my father was choking her in their bedroom. Was a big steroid fan back in the day. I spent most of my middle school and high school career grounded from one semester to the next one because I frequently got C’s in school which my parents would ground us for. Even one C on the report card and it was grounded for the rest of the semester. I still remember getting in trouble so badly for lying about doing my homework, not even so much for not doing my homework. But it was distinctly about lying about it. My father was beating me in our dining room and at one point was physically choking me against the wall, and I remember my mother saying “well Don’t choke him (insert name)” and him looking straight at her with his hands around my neck saying “I’m not choking him” I still remember that same night him having to come in my room to change my ice packs on my swollen face and how petrified I was that the gameboy sp I was playing was flung off the bed in a room with no carpet because I was certain I was going to get beat again. I remember going to school the next and having to tell my teachers (because all six of them forced me to stay after class and talk about it) that I was playing football with my brother and fell on a sprinkler. Funny how their response to me lying about homework was to in turn go to school and lie about why half of my face was swollen and black. I remember the first time i was ever caught shoplifting (was obviously my last time doing it too) when my dad came to pick me up, he was already so nasty to me before leaving the store that the police threatened to not let me leave because he was already trying to hit me in front of them. 

But you know. Now that I’m an adult and have been jumped literally just because of my sexuality. If I’m going to get my ass beat I’m going to get my ass beat. I’m just not living in fear anymore. }}}}


 {my thoughts on my brother}

{{{{Which brings me to my brother. Who as of lately might as well be dead to me. We have not currently spoken since April, and as far as I’m concerned we probably won’t ever speak again. Let’s start with me saying I feel like my brothers relationship with me has always been from the start. Me bailing him out when he needs it. I remember being in elementary school and him getting to go back to sleep after my mother woke us up for breakfast and would leave for work, because it was my job to “wake him up after rugrats” when he was about 12 or 13 he got mixed up with a bad neighborhood kid and ended up almost lighting an entire house on fire in our neighborhood. The police officers were nice enough to offer him the deal that if you stay out of trouble until you’re 18 this will be completely removed off your record with no trace of it ever even happening. Sure enough he starts smoking weed in high school (which is back when it was HIGHLY frowned upon) and guess who had to take every single drug test for his four years of high school. My dumb ass. Bailing him out again. Until finally he got caught coming back late from lunch (upper class men were at the time allowed to leave campus for lunch) and he came back with a hotboxed car and didn’t air it out. So when the principle stopped him to ask why he was late she was literally hit with a cloud of smoke. My brother was the sole reason my high school was no longer allowed to leave campus for lunch. My brother and father have always had an awful relationship too obviously all this places even more tension on it, and eventually lead to him either being kicked out or leaving. I don’t remember which. Being on the streets on his own he was arrested more times for carrying stupid large amounts of weed on him because he sells it, and eventually got charged I think with robbery. Then to top it all off, a few years ago my brother got mixed up in the flocka epidemic. And of course there’s my dumbass bailing him out again being forced to put two stolen bikes in my car and drive him to Miami. 
When I first started realizing how much I hated him was I think my senior year of high school. My parents had gone out of town leaving him in charge. I remember distinctly it was the night before vans warped tour he’s in a huge fight with his at the time girlfriend, because he was literally hitting either her, or her and/or her kid. And I remember he stormed into my room flinging open the door trying to use me as an excuse “isn’t this okay because it’s what dad used to do to us. “ of course having a criminal record he couldn’t find a job and was on probation at my parents house and because nobody wanted to hire somebody with his record they literally gave him a fucking job at the company my father works for. This job is 15$ an hour, gets benefit and vacation days. I on the other hand spent years being treated like shit in jobs. Two years ago I worked for quiksilver over the course of about a year, finally left because they told me and a coworker that we were the ones being considered for management and yet they brought in two outside hires after the second one the other coworker had the sense to leave. My dumb ass stayed thinking well now that she’s gone it’ll look better on me. Which is when they brought in another outside hire. Who I was eventually cool with. I just stopped offering to do the management work for sales associate pay. Until I finally got so fed up that I transferred to GameStop because they were willing to start me as a keyholder since I already had basic management training. So two years trying to work for a manager only to be shit on by my parents because it’s not full time and “at your age your brother worked full time” at my age y’all gave him a fucking career because nobody wanted to hire a literal criminal. Anything I do It’s just never going to be good enough. 


Let me talk about our most recent altercation, because it’s a fantastic transition into my mother, as of last April I was unfortunately unemployed thanks to this whole virus outbreak, and of course that sets off my family members because I sleep all day while they work. So my mother asked me on April 20th the day before my birthday (a day that I was operating on approximately 2 hours of sleep because I’m always up all night) if I could go help my brother in the warehouse where he works because he really needs it.  I have already had altercations with my brother there from helping him a previous time. It was so bad that they sent me home early. So being there in general makes me uncomfortable. Even when I go in to help my dads department. So of course I didn’t want to help which wasn’t an acceptable answer to my mother and after about the 5th time of her saying something obviously I snapped and agreed to which she responded “forget it” and slammed my door shut. (It should be noted that in my mother’s defense I’m a nightmare to wake up because of how little I sleep. There are times I wake up and am in a fight with my mother because she apparently tried to wake me up and I was nasty, meanwhile I have literally no recollection of even speaking to her ) so my dumb ass trying to bite the bullet agrees to go work for eight hours in a hot sweaty warehouse with barely any ac on my birthday of all days. I woke up that morning still mad about the fight I had with my mother the day prior because I feel like as a grown ass adult I should be allowed to say no I don’t want to do something. 

Get to the warehouse work the shift, I leave at five, which apparently was a mistake because I wasnt supposed to leave until 5:30 which I thought was fine because 1) I genuinely thought they left at 5 every day and 2) I didn’t take a lunch break because I was hoping if we happened to get everything done early we would just be able to leave. Obviously that was wrong and I got a shitty passive aggressive text message from my brother.

Having already been in a bad mood from my fight with my mother the day before partnered with my brother annoying me after I had left I stopped by aunts house to vent because I was literally seeing red. Wasn’t even planning on going home for my birthday because I just didn’t want to be around any of them. 


The next day comes and I don’t show up because not only did I not want to be there, but when I had gotten there the day before another employee of that company said “we don’t know if we’ll need you tomorrow or not yet” so I just didn’t bother to show up because if y’all needed me you should have worked that into your text message when you were being an asshole in my opinion. So of course my petty ass isn’t going to show up.  My brother comes home through the door doesn’t even put his shit down and is in my face screaming at me for not showing up “why should I have to explain to my boss why you didn’t come” “why do you get to sleep all day while we work I’m sick of it” turning to my mother “I’m sick of him aren’t y’all sick of him” (to which she agrees probably just trying to get him to calm down, but I won’t ever for a second forget you just said you were sick of me. ) and of course I’m running my mouth back in return, which is when he decided to put his hands on me, shoving me literally to the floor. And this is about where I Black out with anger because I had my Nintendo switch in my hand. The limited edition no longer in production animal crossing themed one at that. So obviously I’m pissed and yank his PlayStation out of the wall and slam it on the ground. You can skip the next parentheses part if you don’t care about why a stupid video game console made me so upset.

(A detour to mention about these video game consoles. My brother and I used to exclusively use Xbox but I made the transition to the PS4 when it came out. My brother didn’t. I had been asking for a PlayStation 4 since they came out for both my birthday and Christmas for I think like two years. Until the year my brother spent Christmas in jail because he was addicted to flocka. When my mom finally bailed him out because she felt like he was actually clean, he got a PlayStation 4. When I asked why he got one and I didn’t despite it literally being the only thing I asked for as a Christmas gift, she said “well he wasn’t here for Christmas so I had to make it special.” I think I eventually got the PlayStation for my birthday the following year. But this fucking switch man. I swore up and down when I was a GameStop employee that they were going to make an animal crossing version and they all laughed at me said if it was going to happen it would have already and talked me into buying just a standard switch instead. Low and behold a few weeks later the animal crossing one is announced and I’m lowkey heartbroken that I just spent a majority of my money on the standard one. I eventually get myself so worked up over it that I asked my mom to front me the money to buy the new system, and I will give her 200 when I sell my switch and the rest from my next paycheck. She’s talking some I can’t I don’t have that kind of money, which would have been totally fine. I was just embarrassed that I not only put my pride away to ask for money, but was also upset enough about not getting the animal crossing one to even be in this situation. So whatever whatever we end up agreeing on if I sell the console first and give her the two hundred she will give me the rest. Where as I was only asking her for the front because I didn’t want to risk selling my console before the new one came out and risk then not having a console at all. Especially since I had already missed like two years of the switches lifespan.  So obviously I’m super thankful to my mom and I literally spent like two days thanking her and talking to her about it, only for me to find out that she had given me my own money. I don’t know what it was for, possibly my unemployment since the console came out around the time the virus was starting to flare. And at that point all I can keep thinking is wow. You really kept my own money from me, made me gamble on being able to find a limited edition console without a preorder. And told me you couldn’t loan me anything. That makes me so mad. How are you going to lie about my own damn money. Serves me right I guess for not being adult enough to stop using our joint bank account.) 

Anyway. I slam his PlayStation on the ground after he put his hand on me the first time we get into a screaming match in his room to which I say something along the lines of “you’re allowed to knock my switch out of my hand so why should you expect any different of your PlayStation” to which he responds (talking out of his ass) “well you didn’t pay for it mom did!” Jokes on you asshole not only did I pay for it entirely with my money but our mother literally withheld my own money from me and made it more difficult for me to get an already difficult to get console. This ends up with him coming back into my room because everyone in my family (myself included) has to have the last word in argument. Which leads to him putting his hands on me a second time except this time since there’s not a 400$ gaming system in my hand I pull his disgusting ass down with me.}}}}}

This whole fight somehow ends with me being kicked out of my house by my mother. 

 {my thoughts on my mother}

{{{{Fun fact. Maybe about a week before this my mother was begging me to stop going out despite taking precautions with a mask and specially made sanitizer consisting of primarily alcohol. Because they had a friend in critical condition from covid. This is the same woman who threw her kid out into streets during the first peak of this epidemic. (I’m in Florida so it is at this moment higher than that first peak because Floridians are trash) so I spend the next three or four day sleeping in my car doing whatever trying to manage on my own, spending what little money I had fixing the joycon drift on my switch that was non existent until my brother attacked me with it in my hand. One thing leads to another and I eventually end up back home. I asked my mom if we could start family therapy because I’m literally holding onto grudges that I don’t know how to let go of. She says when all of this is over but I’m positive she’s forgotten about it and it might very well be what causes me to cut her out all together. 

A few days ago me and my mother got into a huge arguement because she woke me up to ask me to take her to firestone to pick up her car(I’m exhausted but totally not a problem to me at all) so I get right up get dressed grab my keys and when I walk out of my room she goes “are you ready now I’m not in a rush or anything” I was a little annoyed by the stupid question I’ll admit, like you just two minutes ago came into my room to wake me up and ask me to take you. Yes I’m ready to go lol. Otherwise I’d still be asleep. She of course takes my flat response (a slight mixture of both my annoyance and exhaustion) as me being in a bad mood. So we get into my car and she’s overreacting because my car is a little shaky (which I’m almost positive is just because I need air in my tires) talking some oh my god we have to pull over what if you have a flat. Like we definitely would know if we were driving on a flat tire. It’s been doing this since like the second week I got this car. So I’m just sitting there trying to get to the destination as fast as possible trying to hold my tongue and not cause a fight when she sets me off and says something along the lines of “you’re in a bad mood because I asked you to take me” my response being “oh what I’m in a bad mood because I got right up to do something you asked me to do???” which fucking infuriated me and caused a screaming match in my car. I don’t understand why she has this god complex where she thinks she gets to tell other people how they feel about something. She did it to me on my birthday too which I forgot to mention and am now too lazy to go back and add in. But like it drives me crazy. I don’t care if they’re right wrong or somewhere in between. Nobody has the right to decide how somebody feels about something except for that person. So when I sit there and tell you I’m not mad and you tell me “yes you are mad that’s why you’re being shitty” that’s a self fulfilling prophecy right there. Of course that shits going to make me mad. If you’re just going to decide I’m in a bad mood for me then shit I guess I’m in a bad fucking mood then. 

So this screaming match in my car leads to her saying “I hope something happens to your car, and when it does DONT call me”. I will never ever in a million years forget she said that to me. I hope that when something does happen to my car, I’m inside of it, I hope it’s something fatal, and I hope she has to live with it for the rest of her life. And then of course after our screaming match she sends me a passive aggressive text message (because apparently my family is famous for doing that shit) talking some I won’t be screamed at in a car that I bought you, you are SO disrespectful the next time you talk to me like that you can find a new place to live! (As if she didn’t kick me out when I was 16, and 18, and 23. Like clearly I can manage in my car bitch try me. I would rather starve to death on the streets than feel like I need help from someone who treats me like shit) Skip the parentheses if you don’t care about context with my car history

(Both me and my brother were fortunate enough to get cars for our 16th birthday. The difference between us is my brother has wrecked I think 2 cars my parents bought him, one car they gave him because my mom got a new car (which that one he wasn’t at fault for but still it’s a car to add to your tally) and ruined one of my dads trucks that he was using for whatever reason one day.  I on the other hand drove the same car that I had since I was 16 until literally this year when I turned 25 and was given a new one. But honestly my parents had been trying to buy me another one for a few years I just fought them on it because I didn’t want a new car which I will explain why later. )

And then now just today, we are in another arguement because I think last night, my brother walked out our back gate to go sell drugs in our mailbox because he thinks he’s cool and tough and can handle jail as if he isn’t literally crying “mommy bail me out” when he’s in there. As he’s going out he knocks over the ashtray I had been using over there (which was admittedly in the walkway but only because that particular night I was in a hurry to relocate under my backyard awning because it was raining and I had all my technology on me) but when he walks back he has the nerve to say to me “your ashtray is knocked over “ as if i wasn’t outside and heard him kick it over like I’m supposed to lean up after him. Despite us having literally not a said a word to eachother since April. So I hid the ashtray that he normally uses with the mindset of “if he needs an ashtray he’ll have to go over and clean up the one he kicked over.” Only for me to find that my mother ended up being the one to clean up his mess. Which of course infuriated me. And then she had the nerve to defend him in a text message after we got into an arguement about it. “Well it is your ashtray...” okay did I kick over my ashtray or did my brother. Because that’s the person who should have cleaned it up was who knocked it over. 

In regards to my mother specifically it hurts me the most. Because I often at times feels like she’s the only one out of the 3 of my immediately family that I could have a relationship with or that I actively want to have a relationship with and that bridge is so close to being burnt to a crips. I don’t want to appear ungrateful because as a mother she does go above and beyond. I’ve been spoiled sure. But my problem with it is, I feel like my mother only gives as much as she gives so that she has ammunition to hold over peoples head. I fought her for YEARS about getting a new because I knew she would just hold it over my head. Which obviously I was right about. I remember being kicked out when I was 18 because I wasn’t working and i had just gotten kicked out of college and she said leave your keys pack your stuff and find somewhere to live. So I did set off with no car no money no nothing ended up being taken in by my best friends family. Spent a year or two there, and I literally did not get my car back (the same one she had given me at 16) until the girl I was living with literally called her in tears asking if we could just borrow it so we could go see her mother who was in the hospital because she needed brain surgery. LITERAL BRAIN SURGERY was the only reason I got my car back. And it still took my friend like two or three times of asking my mother for her to let me use my car just to take her to see her mother. 

My father has always babied me and let me get away with more than he lets my brother get away with I can admit that. The problem with it is, that because I don’t feel the same type of yearning for a relationship about my father that I do about my mother I don’t really care about him favoring me. And because my dad tends to let me get away with more my mom feels like she has to let my brother get away with more, which in turn causes me to always just feel like I’m chasing my mother’s approval or some shit. }}}}



 {thoughts on my own disgusting self}

It’s only been recently that I’m starting to come around to my father and that’s only because I think I’m starting to hate my mother. 


I know I probably sound ungrateful and entitled. And I can see why. But I am truly thankful for how privilege I’ve been and all that I’ve been given. But I don’t know how to not feel the way that I feel about these things. 


And that’s not to say I’m perfect either. I’ve caused plenty of problem for my family. So let me just skip to all my flaws now. 

When I was a kid like before I could even start kindergarten I was literally already sucking dick. My next door neighbor ( my brothers age at the time) used to make me do it to him and I used to agree because he was considerably nicer to me when I do would so. He was already a problem child too but that’s neither here nor there. I was pretty much only sucking him off because my brother always hated when I would hang out with him and his friends, and the neighbor always let me hang around (for obvious reasons) distinctly remember my brother catching us a few times but I guess nothing was ever done about it. Not even sure if my parents know about it. 

But as an adult I can see that’s where I started getting fucked up. Idk if I necessarily blame my neighbor for me being gay, because I do firmly as a gay man believe that it’s just who you are and can’t be changed, but I feel like there will literally always be a part of me that questions it. Like what if I wasn’t sucking dick at five years old, would I be interested in girls? I remember having a crush on at least two different girls before i met (what I now as an adult realize was probably my first boy crush) like looking back on my child hood I vividly remember playing “doctor” with other kids or truth or dare that always ended sexual and I realize like damn. That’s fucking gross we were all kids. 


Fast forward to me being in I think middle school, and I was caught sexually experimenting with my cousin. I was definitely old enough to know better so I take fault there, but I also wasn’t ever the one initiating it. You know. I was letting him suck me off for longer than I can remember honestly, but I also distinctly remember I wasn’t the one initiating it. I still remember the first night at his house when he asked me to go pornhub and grilling him about how he even knows about that. I don’t remember when I started letting him do stuff to me, but I know that I shouldn’t have. I remember well enough that when he would come sleepover there were times I would opt to stay up late with my father in hopes that he would fall asleep waiting for me to come in. I remember one time I was up late and he comes walking out like 2 hours after being put to bed because he was trying to get me to come in to bed with him. But again I was the older kid in that situation. So that’s my fuck up. Obviously when we got caught it put a wedge between that side of our family. I can see why, but in hindsight I always wonder. Would you have still distanced yourself if you knew it was your son who had been initiating it? Because he was younger all the blame was pushed onto me. And I can see why. Again I should have known better. 

That’s probably around the time I started getting fat. By high school at one point I was over 300 pounds and openly gay. Never had a serious relationship. Never even had someone interested in a relationship with me. I can see why. Not only was I cringey in high school but I was literally disgusting. It wasn’t till about my senior year I finally got back under 300 pounds and started losing some weight and gaining some confidence. 

But here’s the kicker. Before I started losing the weight I had become a literal serial catfisher. And I’m talking like anybody you wanted to see naked I would go out of my way to target. Friends, friends boyfriends. Nobody was off limits to me. It makes me sick thinking about the hundreds of people I’ve catfished because I was horny and lonely. Catfishing even basically got me kicked out of my college ( granted I was surprisingly innocent at that time but because the kid found out about me being a catfish he refused to believe it wasn’t me, despite me literally having to show my catfish accounts to the dean and them not matching up to whoever he was talking to. The college only realized their mistake a semester or two later because the kid was immediately put on academic probation the semester following my suspension, and then got caught trying to do the same thing to another gay student the semester after that. Which is when they were like wow we were wrong we’re so sorry don’t even worry about the requirements we gave you for coming back you can just come back never did though.) 

It wasn’t only until I hit maybe 22 or 23 that it like clicked with how awful what I was doing was. And started making an active effort to stop it. And I feel like I was only even willing to because I fell in genuine love with somebody I was catfishing. When I finally told him, we were fine for a few days. He told me he didn’t care that I was a guy because he fell in love with the person behind a screen. But all of that quickly crumbled to ashes. That’s another one that’s my own fault. Not only was I doing something shitty but I was also in too deep. I think I still to this day get texted from somebody I started catfishing when I was about 15 or 16 that I just am too afraid to finally tell the truth to. 

But since the recent heart break I’ve thankfully been able to almost entirely remove catfishing from life save for the one guy I was in too deep with, and the old catfish accounts that I occasionally log into when I’m desperately alone/horny/whatever it may be. 

I’m tired of feeling alone. I just want to be loved. I want someone to want me. To care about me.

I’m starting to realize this world is awful. Almost every thing and everyone in it is bleak. Some people genuinely want to live long happy lives, me personally, I don’t think I can make it doing this shit for another 25 years. Self deprecating jokes and suicidal humor are my biggest weapons. Because I feel like if I don’t turn them into jokes. I’ll let them overcome me. Too many people in this world are awful. I don’t want to be one anymore. 


I doubt any of you will actually care enough to read this through. But if you for some unknown reason did, then I thank you. Because I could really use a friend. 



TLDR; I’m a scumbag. I’m starting to think my family is scumbags, and I’m genuinely losing my will to live. I’ve been holding on to grudges that are literally consuming me and transforming me into a being of hatred and it makes me sick to my stomach. I don’t know how much longer I can do this, but god I would absolutely love to just be taken out by a bus tomorrow."
axjmof,depression,I survived my suicide attempt..,"Yesterday I had lost all hope and just went ahead and hung myself from the ceiling fan.. made sure to lock everything so I can't be saved. As soon as I moved the chair under my feet I thought my neck would break cuz it was considerably high but it didn't happen, had a really bad choking experience and let me tell you it hurts really bad. 

Half a min in I went unconscious due to the severe pain, woke up to me lying on the ground my mum and dad crying and me choking on some blood( I don't remember how long I did stay that way but apparently not long enough). 

Had a long talk with my parents and it's better now, I'm not sure what's gonna happen next. 

Edit:- I'm 17years old"
gem759,depression,My sister saved my life yesterday.,"There I was minutes away from grabbing my gun, about to walk in the woods and end it. Was actually starting to feel pretty good about that too. Not having to hate myself, going through life everyday while nothing seems to make me happy anymore. Then my younger sister gave me a rock she painted for me. Blue with a guitar on it, and a moon with stars in the middle of the guitar. It said made in 2020, Love Nikole. I almost cried in front of her which is something she's never seen me do. It just hit me so hard, like beyond words. My family is very loving but they mostly keep to themselves. I just thought to myself, how could I put her and everyone else through such a thing. Spent half the night crying like a little girl, I'm 34M. Still woke up feeling like garbage, but I dunno somethings different, I guess that feeling like someone's thinking of me is helping a bit. I can't say anything to her now but in the future I'm really gonna thank her for that. I still feel like I don't wanna be here, but whereas before it was 100%, now I'm slightly on the fence about it. Hopefully this is a little inspiration for those out there thinking like me. I should probably reach out to her but things like that are so hard for me, plus then the whole family would know. Thats why i like coming here. It hurts but I feel like I must press on."

""what do you want to do later ?""

I hate these questions. Because I can't see any lights in my future, only pain, stupidity and failure.

When people tell me these questions, I just look at them stupidly, because I can't reply ""in a grave, or maybe in a river, maybe the streets ? I have no idea""

These questions hurts, because it make me realize how much a failure I am, and how meaningless and absurd life is. I don't know. I wish I knew what I want to do, but I don't know.

jpqevo,depression,Depression turns me into a bitter self-destructive asshole w no empathy,"It’s such a toxic downward spiral. My depression manifests itself as chronic indifference, loss of interest in doing anything, no hope/purpose in life, and the general malaise causes me to, perhaps worst of all, turn into a bitter, insufferable asshole. Everything and everyone bothers me to a much stronger degree. I become increasingly judgemental and dismissive of others. I lash out and hurt those close to me when I need them most. It’s like I’m a completely different person; everything sucks, everyone sucks, and I don’t want to deal with any of it. 

It’s incredibly destructive but I honestly can’t help myself, as I’m too depressed to even maintain a conversation and feign interest or empathy in anyone to begin with. I used to be so charismatic, but trying to rekindle that energy again just makes me come off as janky and contrived. Again, I’m like a completely different person. Spooky."

jusevs,depression,Keeping myself alive is just so much work for so little reward,"My parents don't understand how I could be so lazy that I never want to heat up any of my food to make it taste better -- I just think the difference in taste isn't a big enough reward for the amount of effort it takes. Similarly, grooming does not seem worth it at all unless I have to go somewhere (and even then, sometimes I just put a hat on and call it a day). I just wish my brain would reward me with happy chemicals for getting shit done, the way it's supposed to, because it feels like every day I just wake up and wait for the day to be over already."
c67izj,depression,"Depression is having no drive, purpose, passion, or commitment","I go through life with a lingering sense of worry, fear, doubt, uncertainty, regret, and utter lack of passion or drive. I am constantly worried about something going wrong. Lack focus and passion for what I do professionally and have no confidence in anything.

But the instant we say we’re giving up, everyone’s like “Oh no! You have so much to live for! Think about x,y, and z! You can’t give up! Things are gonna get better!” Yeah, shove it up your ass. You’re just trying to make sure your conscience is clean when I’m dead and gone. You think you care, but you’re really just being cautious for yourself and trying to save your own soul while acting to save another. Good luck with that. I’m tired of being told to get help. With what fucking money? All just to talk to some damn superficial person who is literally being paid to be a friend to me because I’m so fucking shit at doing it without paying? What the hell is the point of trying? I’m stuck here, just like I’ll always be. Just give me the freedom to take my leave. I’ll be happy then, but I’ll be decaying in the ground by then. Ironic, huh? 

I wish things were different."
k4lq26,depression,Can someone read this ? It’s my full story,"If I can have at least one person read this, it would make me feel really happy because someone can get the full picture of my life.

I’m a black 17M in high-school who lives in the USA. My interests fall in computer science, math, video games, and anime/manga. When I was younger I loved video games so much, and I still do to this day. Video games were the reason I was planning to work at a game development studio in the future. I felt more understood by VG’s than I did with my family. 

I’m not close with my family and I don’t ever will be because they are toxic af. I’ve been psychologically abused and nobody would ever listen to my end of the story. They are the major cause for my depression, and some for my suicidal tendencies. As more time passed I would stay in my room as much as I can because I whenever I would step out, my parents would drag with them to some store, usually insult me, or whine about how lazy I am. My mom has been more abusive, but at the same time she is an idiot who I was able fool on a few occasions. My dad is annoying and racist. For some ungodly reason he hates white people, which makes me embarrassed to have him as a father. My stepmom is stupid and racist so I can’t stand her. Certainly least, my sister is a literal bitch, who has no regard for anyone’s feelings. 

School is the worst thing to have ever happened to me. I don’t even know where to begin with school because I have had so much shitty stuff happen to me. Elementary school was ok. I was easy target for harassment, but it’s not as bad as it was in middle school. When I was in elementary school, I never saw the importance of school. I barely did any work, and never bothered to pay attention in class. Almost everyday in elementary school, I just looked forward to going home and playing on my Nintendo DS. It was my major motivation back then.

Then came middle school. This is where so many problems came to rise. Words cannot describe how horrible my middle school experience was. This is when school pressure really started hitting me and that I felt the need to work harder. I had only like one friend in the beginning of 6 grade, and by then I began getting bullied by having that friend. This friend of mine was seen as very strange and weird by every other student, but I defended him and decided to go through constant harassment so I can keep being his friend. One day at the end of the year, my science teacher decided to expose me In front of the class because she got so sick of me not turning my work. I don’t blame her though lol. Next is 7th grade where there was no end to bullying. Throughout the school year, I tried so hard to fit in and be like everyone else, but it really backfired making me look more like an idiot. I would do the most retarted shit just for attention because I felt so lonely. Worst idea ever. Now those memories are stuck with the other students who went to class with me. I asked I crush out and she rejected me (wasn’t much a big deal, but I did feel pretty embarrassed after). Almost all my friends were fake, and would easily turn their back on me. Whenever I was alone, thoughts of self harm would become more frequent, and whenever I wasn’t I was being harassed by someone. The last day of 7th grade is literally the worst day of my life. Completely lonely the first half, then, midday, I accidentally fell in some chalk that was on the concrete, and it ruined the clothes I was wearing that day. My “friend” saw this as the perfect opportunity to embarrass me in front of much other students as he can. Almost immediately when he found out, he literally started running around the school and tried to tell almost anyone nearby about how dumb I looked with chalk on my clothes. Students nearly when they saw me just gave a weird look or an expression of confusion. I was so suicidal that day. Next is 8th grade. Not as terrible as 7th, but still bad. I was admitted into a 9th grade biology class because of my great grades in 7th grade environmental science, but the biology class was horrible to be in. The teacher was absolute shit, and made it harder for us just for the sake of it. When I came in that class on the first day, I almost had a heart attack because there were so many students who were admitted in this class and I knew none of them. Some of the other students I sat with hated me because I got some of the concepts confusing. Insert some more embarrassing moments then you have 8th grade. High school is better then middle school, but I still hate school in general. 9th grade: I’ve never been so lonely. 10th grade: My existential crisis began. 11th grade: suicide attempts. 12: burnout and more suicide attempts. I don’t want to treat life as a separate entity, but 2020 killed me this year. I wish I can just take a mental break, but my parents are denying my depressive symptoms. Doing schoolwork has never been so difficult holy shit. If I can’t even do it well in high school, then how can I do it college ? 

Life is so horrible. I get abused for the most minor things and I don’t know what to do anymore. I have no idea what to do for the future because I ruined my grades and I’ve overthought what I want to be when I grow up. I attempted suicide like over 10 times this year, but none of them work. I don’t understand why people just won’t help me, even when I reach out. I wish my life just ended by whatever means. I don’t to be homeless especially at this because it’s insanely cold outside. My point is everything is just not fucking fair. I actively try do the most I can to rid depression and do my schoolwork, but nobody will fucking cooperate with me. Even when I’m having my best day, I still always contemplate on suicide as if it’s the “answer” to my life. I low key wish someone would hug me

gk8swn,depression,Happiness really is a privilege,"Growing up I never thought about it like that. I always thought happiness was just something everyone eventually had and that it was just the norm, and that anyone who wasn’t happy was some outcast. Now I see happiness really is a privilege, and I don’t say this in spite. If you are happy, that’s amazing, but also I think there are a lot of people who don’t realize how lucky they are to be happy. It truly boggles my mind that there are people who go to bed excited for the next day, it’s a feeling I don’t think I can remember having, at least for a very very long time."

e5yn9a,depression,Anyone else feel like they've lost their identity?,"I used to be able to actually do stuff. Even if I didn't want to, I went to bed early. I got up in the morning. I had hobbies and sustainable goals. I worked on my problems and found solutions.

That was 6 years ago. Now, I want nothing but to get better, but I just keep being my own worst enemy. I want to get a job. I'm 23 and have absolutely no work experience. I paid $2300 last year to improve my grades and I still haven't read a single page. I want to, so why can't I just fucking do it? I have ADHD as well, but that's been with me my entire life so I can't really blame it on that..

I just have no sense of self anymore. I do the same thing every single day. I get up at noon, play video games, go to bed. There's just no productivity, even though I hate living like this. I always tell myself ""I can't take this anymore. I'll start making changes."" What do I do the next morning? Eat like shit and play video games all day.

I don't know what the fuck I'm doing with my life. I'm not strong enough to get up and make changes. Not consistently, at least. I see a therapist every 2 weeks, but I feel like he's starting to give up on me.

Absolutely FUCK depression."
1eqtrg,depression,Today was my 21st birthday,"I turned 21 today. I live in one of the biggest college towns in the country. When you turn 21 here, it's a big deal. I just finished my third year of college and my third year of having absolutely no friends. I'm not the party type or anything, but it still is a bummer not to have a single friend to share the occasion with. Today I received three texts (more than most days): one from my mom, my dad and my cousin wishing me happy birthday. In all fairness, I don't have a facebook and I don't expect people to memorize by date of birth or anything, but it still feels really sad not to hear back from anyone. I guess I've never been comfortable with having a facebook, the idea of being so interconnected which each others' lives and making daily status updates is such a foreign concept to me. But I think in not having a facebook, I've sacrificed my social life absolutely. 

Anyways, I've spent the entire day in my room with the lights off trying to drink away the depression of today and of college. There is not a single person who if I called them right now, they would pick up and talk to me. I've been fighting with my parents and after a few shared 'unpleasantries,' are not answering my calls because they want we ""to cool off,"" and understandably so. I've been 'no contact' for ever a year with my girlfriend ( I knew from highschool) who I ended up dating long distance when we started college. Today, I made an attempt to call her (went to voicemail) to ask her if she'd let me take her out to lunch as friends to catch up but I haven't heard from her. It really breaks my heart that I lost that person who was my best friend for a good part of my life. I assumed she would have remembered today was my birthday. I certainly didn't forget hers. 

Anyways, If you've made it this far, from the bottom of my heart, thanks for listening to me vent. 


EDIT: The Reddit community has been absolutely amazing. You guys have been sending me happy birthday wishes from all corners of the globe, I've been getting offers for people to buy me drinks, and some have even given me their cell numbers to talk/text me if I was still feeling down. You guys are unbelievable. You turned what was a miserable day for me into one of the most memorable birthdays I've ever had. From the bottom of my heart, thank you. For all of you who took the time to help a stranger on the internet, thank you. Your words of encouragement have lifted up my spirit exponentially. I can't say it enough: thank you, thank you, thank you. "
gliw37,depression,Depression ruined my creativity,"I can't use my mind in the way that it used to work. I can't think too strongly. I can't think too deeply. I am a shell of my former self. It hurts to use my brain. I have no strength for patience and doing what I want to. I am weak. I escaped depression, but I am weak..

Edit: So many beautiful comments. Thank you all for sharing. I love this community as it's very insightful and you don't quite feel as alone as you may think you are."
fedwbi,depression,"I hate it so much when you try and express your feelings to your parents, but they turn it around and compare your suffering with theirs.","I've been feeling really depressed and lonely lately from my job, I'm a full time late night janitor for a courthouse just 10 miles away from my hometown. Working there has been pretty easy, but I wound up feeling super lonely a lot considering I don't really get to talk to my friends or hang out with them much.

So just today I came home late as usual, and I have a little interaction with my mom after she made a joke to me that I took pretty personal and felts like was more of an insult rather than a sense of humor. I told her that I didn't really want to joke around like that, but she refused to listen and told me to just go away then. Despite attempting to change the topic and explain why I haven't been feeling so high, all she kept doing was telling what a great mom she is for raising me and my brother while struggling to make ends meet and keep the house. What an ungrateful little bastard I am for not appreciating her hard work and sacrifices. 

At that moment I was legitimately about to begin to cry. But rather instead of pausing and trying to reverse the damages, all my mom did was host a little parental style of the oppression Olympics and proclaim her amount of tears and cries over the course of three weeks. I got out just before my first tear would legitimately run down my cheek. 

And even before I went to bed, she goes on about how her life is more worse than ours, then escalates into a more ""This is why you'd make a terrible mistake getting behind the wheel"" considering I had practice driving this morning. Unaware that she had just lite the fuse to trigger the firework, but she didn't seem to care. 

Thanks for reading, I hope you feel better soon and find the key to unlocking your next set of happiness. Along with having a parent who doesn't make your suffering all about them and why you shouldn't be depressed."
e1zc9s,depression,Anyone else wake up and mad they woke up?,Like every morning I think oh fuck this again. I can’t do this.
lr8zpz,depression,I'm too fucked up. I just exist. I doubt anyone will care to read this... they never do.,"I don't want advice. I don't want to hear that my problems aren't a big deal while you stand there with your success stories and your dating histories and your loving partners. I don't want to hear your stories about how you found your SOs when this is specifically a major part of what's wrong with me; literally a simple ""this is what helped me"" would be nice, not trying to make me feel worse. I don't want to hear the same bullshit about loving myself. I barely even have the energy to write well. I want to vent about how much I hate myself. How FUCKED UP I am.

I've lost 10 years, maybe more than that to porn addiction. I don't know if I walked in on my parents or if I was exposed to sexuality at a young age. But I've been masturbating since long before I even hit puberty. And then I discovered porn. Which leads me to now. A porn addict trying to break his habits by only masturbating 3 days a week... and then that's only turned into masturbating *multiple* times a day. It's fucked my relationships up. I can make friends, guys call me cool and women call me sweet. But I just... I'm too scared to escalate sexually and romantically. I can't stand up for myself so people walk over me. I'm afraid of taking risks. I'm a virgin at almost 23. I do not have a car, can't even drive. Never held down a job. Trying to lose weight but making no progress. Never been to a bar. Only been to one party. Never hooked up. Never had a relationship. The only things I have going for me are my writing and my drawing, and even then I'm losing interest in those as well. I don't blame women. I don't blame men either. It all lies with me.

My family isn't any better. I've tried talking about this to them multiple times. I can predict exactly what they say: ""this too shall pass"", ""believe what you want to believe"" ""if you believe it won't happen, it won't."" Yeah, great. Thanks for the ""help."" And then there's the verbal abuse from my narcissistic shrew of a mother and the complete apathy of my father, who constantly tells me he'll have my back but never seems to step up when I truly need him... but he IS happy to yell at and threaten me every time I try standing up for myself against my mother. Every time I try to leave, they threaten to call the cops. I have nowhere to go, no source of income.

I am a fucked up, broken, weird piece of trash who drags the few people who care for him down with his negativity. They're better than me, none of them deserve me. I feel this void in the center of my stomach and heart wherever I go, and now that I've spent all day reading through reddit (seriously, every time these moments of depression happen, ***EVERY*** post I see has to be about sex and dating and relationships), I feel even worse. So much worse than yesterday. I can't forgive myself for the thing's I've done in the past. I sabotage myself every single time. In my worst moments I have these thoughts, these fucking FANTASIES of tying a wire to my neck and the other end to a car, and then letting the wire hang me and hopefully cutting my head off.

All I do is exist. I can't live like this. Normally I don't feel suicidal. But now the thoughts are coming back. Wanna know the funny thing? If I die, people will just go ""that sucks, pass the apple juice"", chalk me up to a statistic, and forget. Because nobody gives a shit about worthless men who can't keep up with the rest of them.

I don't even know why I wrote this. Nobody is going to notice or care. People rarely do anyways.

**EDIT: I'm seeing a therapist online.**

**EDIT 2: I can't say I'm feeling better than I was yesterday when I posted this, but... a Platinum, a Gold, Silvers, so many kind comments... I truly don't know what to say. I wasn't expecting this to get so much traction, and I'm so close to crying at seeing so many people reach out and...** ***care***. **I'll try and respond to everyone when I can. Just... thank you, everyone. For helping me feel a bit less alone.**

**EDIT 3: Well... I don't know what to say. I was okay for a few days after posting this. Now the weight in my chest and the bad thoughts are creeping back in again. They just... are. Every single time I think I'll get better, and then nothing at all.**

i9k81v,depression,Just got dumped,"My girlfriend for 7,5 years just dumped me because “its hard to live with somebody that is always depressed” and because she has more intrest in another man.

Right now, about 6 hours after it happend i still feel like my world had ended and that i wanne end it all.
I’ve been trying to do something to keep my mind busy but everything that i do atm, makes me think of her.
I will be fine someday i hope.

Edit edit: i wanne thank everybody who commented,liked, private messaged, and awarded.
When i saw her leave and i knew I couldn’t call her mine anymore i really really wanted to die, i was close to do something i would regret.
I still have those feelings but thanks to everybody here im sure im not gonna act up on those thoughts.
Please everybody when my post faded away, keep helping people in this sub the way you helped me.

lp0fp4,depression,"As a single 26 year old male with no friends, I'm really as disposable as you can get to society.","Just a thought. 

Also been trying to find a new job for over a year now in an industry that's covid proof and keep getting rejected. Getting dangerously close to my absolute breaking point now. 

I'd go out and do something this Sunday but my presence anywhere usually feels like some sort of disgusting burden if I'm not paying for shit.

Edit: I really didn't expect this post to explode but I wrote it when I genuinely broke down. It feels like I really hit a nerve with a lot of people. I'll keep reading your comments, it's important to let off steam somewhere, even if it's anonymously online. I ended up grabbing a quick bite and a hot chocolate from somewhere. Still paid for shit but I feel a little better now."
byvoy4,depression,"In your experience, is it common to dismiss your depression as just being a bad person?","What I mean is that I constantly worry that I'm not actually depressed, that I'm just lazy and don't want to take the next step in life, that I don't want to put in the work to get where I know I want to be.
So I'm wondering if anyone relates to that"
kjpy5l,depression,My depression gets worse during the holidays,"I’ve noticed that my depression gets worse during Christmas, my birthday, New Years, July 4th, etc. I wonder if it’s because I feel really lonely while everyone is celebrating. Does anyone else feel the same way?"
fj8mva,depression,"Have you ever seen your friends smile and thought ""Yeah they are better off without me*?","I'll start by saying this : Under no circumstances have my friends ever treated me poorly.

It's been a while since that happened. The bell rang and the break began. So I went to find them and when I did they were laughing so hard (I was in my very lows that day), I felt so nice for them and at the same time I thought ""I can't offer them that"". Before we went back to the classes, I let them walk infront of me because I didn't feel like being 100% in the mood and just by looking at them I kept thinking how great they are together.
Now today I saw some Insta stories of them staying at the house of the one I am closest to and it kinda hit me again. I hope I am not just jealous. It's just that at points I feel like I annoy them when they give me no reason to believe that.

I always tell jokes and laugh and 90% of the time they won't even notice the state of me because of how well I hide it. I love them, yet I am sure they deserve someone who is not like me.  Especially the one I am or used to (yes I am insecure) be closest to. She deserves the world and she's always been there for me but I can't keep being a burden to someone so kind, whom I love so much. I just feel like they ""clicked"" so much better and even though on one hand it kinda hurts on the other it is nice to see them like that. Especially when the other one got hurt by her once best friend. 
Anyway thanks for reading... What about you?

EDIT : Thank you everyone for replying, each and every one of you. I haven't answered to everybody. Sometimes I don't know what to say but I have read all the comments, I love you all.

crfugo,depression,"Does hearing ""college is the best time of your life"" or ""enjoy being young while it lasts"" freak anyone else out?","Because for me, probably like for so many of us here, it forces me to view my entire life as a waste of time. I wouldn't even say I'm looking for help or reassurance with this post, more just curious if this FOMO is widespread. 

I've devoted so much energy towards living the life found in college brochures - tons of social/hobby clubs, going out to bars and trying to dance with people, attending lectures and keeping an eye out for local events (whether because I'm interested in the event itself or because I feel like going would make me seem more interesting) - and I hate all of it. I haven't met a single person I enjoy spending time with. Even my academics make me miserable. To top it all off, when someone detects I'm pretending to have fun and calls me fake or disrespects me it stings for months afterwards. Because we know that's what life mostly is for us: a choice between faking happiness/confidence or revealing just how negative/pained we are and repelling all these people who want to have a good time."
be76g1,depression,I want to be left alone but don’t want to be alone?,So I’ve felt with depression for about 10 years now and it’s always so confusing when I push people away but still want them to care for me. Instead of going out and doing things with my friends I’ll stay at home and cry. Instead of reaching out to people I’ll think about how they probably hate me. Whenever I try to explain my depression to someone it feels like all I’m doing is complaining. I’m just so tired of feeling like this. Does anyone else feel like this?

cqd639,depression,You wanna know the worst thing about depression (to me),"It's that depression doesn't kill you desire to want to do things, it doesn't kill your dreams and what you want in life, it just stops you from doing them.

Half an hour later, my father calls me and told me to come to the hospital.

It turns out, my mother (who had been fighting cancer for almost a year) stopped breathing. A couple hours later, she dies.

I didn't feel bad about it for a while, but now, been isolated i feel really lonely, sad and heartbroken. i have no one to talk to about this. Also, i now find it difficult to connect to other women because of trust issues.

I don't have bags under my eyes, I get a lot of sleep every night, I eat well, I take showers and keep my apartment semi-organised and clean. I also run two YouTube channels where I'm silly, say funny things, edit in a humorous manner, etc. If anything, I look like the happiest person on earth. 

But when I'm alone, away from the cameras, I sit and do nothing, with toxic thoughts swimming around in my mind for hours on end. I wake up telling myself to keep pushing through, even though I don't believe I'll get very far. When I try to talk to people, ""you don't look depressed, though"" is always the first thing I hear, and it shuts me right up.

Someone doesn't need to have the stereotypical lifeless eyes, messy hair, messy apartment, monotone voice, and bags under their eyes like in the movies to be validated as depressed. Depression is a silent killer, it barely shows itself to anyone but its host.

I’m not super happy and slightly frustrated over something? Friend says “why are you so snappy lately” or “what do you expect me to do”. Nothing. I just want some empathy since everything that happens in my life is going fucking wrong.

Whenever I'm alone, I might have moments of sadness, but I also moments of joy.



When I'm with others, I forget what my thoughts are really about and it feels like I am caught to spend time with them.




I don't want people to occupy  me or make me happy.

I just want to be how I am. Angry, sad, tired. 


And just deal with my own thoughts without having to tell people how I feel and why I feel that way.





I don't even want help. Because everytime someone tries to help, it feels like they are forcing me into a certain behaviour that I don't want.



It's not that I see my depression as a disease or illness, I see it as a symptom for something deeper. For the fact that I simply don't want to be part of this society, be ""normal"", hang around with others. 


Meeting friends feels so pointless, so shallow. Like you are still suffering but you forget it for a few moments. I don't want to forget, because I actually think the suffering might wanna tell me something.




If your leg hurts because you broke it, you don't just swallow pills or hang around others and everything will be fine.

Stop using the uber app to go to work when I can perfectly walk (it's just 2.7 kms - or about 1.6 miles), cook my own meals and stop ordering from an app or eating junk food, start exercising (my apartment building has a gym where I can use wherever I want), go to bed early, wake up in time, have breakfast before leaving the house, reply to all the messages I've been avoiding for months, start to be productive at work and stop scrolling through reddit, get out of my art block and start drawing again, post more things on my artistic social media so I can be more active, start applying for jobs (I don't get paid enough and hate my current job), finding a new apartment to stay (My roommate is my exe's cousin so its a bit... weird?). Just ""simple"" things I thought I could handle and that would make me feel way better with myself. But I can't. I literally can't. Every time I try to get out of bed in the morning I cry 'cause I simply can't. I walk in front of the gym and just want to cry, can't even step on it. Sometimes I can even put on my gym clothes. I turn on my computer I just want to die, my energy starts to drop drastically and its an exhausting task to read my emails and start working. I'm always procrastinating and pushing people away.

**I think the thing that's bothering me the most is that I can't achieve the simplest goals, and I'm failing even on the silliest things in day life**. **I don't have suicidal thoughts anymore, neither the urge to hurt myself, so sometimes I just feel like this might not be depression, it's just perhaps me not trying hard enough.** But either way I can't live like this anymore. I've been deeper before, but that doesn't mean my life is wonderful. It took me a few weeks to finally defeat my social anxiety and finally called the therapist. My appointment will be next friday. I'm very nervous, but relieved. I really hope things get better from now on so I can have a normal life again. :)"
5d2dyi,depression,"""Depression is living in a body that fights to survive with a mind that tries to die.""","This was the caption of a photo that my classmate submitted for a photography class. (We have this Facebook group where we submit all our photography works)

**And it just resonated with me.** Depression is such an ass. Struggling with depression has fucked with my life so bad that I ended up self-harming and nearly killing myself three times this year. And I couldn't do it because I'm too afraid. I want things to end. But I couldn't. 

At this moment, I'm not suicidal. I'm not even at the point that I'm severely depressed to the point I can't function normally. It just resonates with my struggle, especially with my experience for years, but this year in particular... The fact that my mind has been telling me to die but my body doesn't. The fact that I still have it despite having great family, friends and a loving girlfriend. The fact that it has been affecting my life quite severely. The fact that it gives me anxiety and doubt for the future. And ultimately, the fact that I realize that its such a miracle that I'm waking up each day, still alive, and bravely battling depression.

Peace out, and much love."
jxcbzs,depression,Does depression affect your memory?,"Yesterday my family was talking about different vacations and memorable moments, but I almost couldn't remember a single one. Most of the things that they were talking about had happened during the worst part of my depression and there are birthdays, Christmases, parties, dates, vacations, entire school subjects that I do not remember at all. Is depression the main factor for something like this?"
f9rtou,depression,I have constant passive suicidal thoughts,"Recently I think I’ve been okay. Not super happy, but not completely down in the dumps, but ever since about a week ago, I’ve been getting passive suicidal thoughts. If you don’t know what that is, it’s when you think about suicide but have no actual plan or motive to do it. This has happened every day. Even this morning, my first thought when getting out of bed was “I should just die” These thoughts get annoying as it demotivates me from what I have to do during the day, which makes me feel useless, which makes me think about suicide. It’s an endless fucking cycle and I hate it."

k1k9bd,depression,Don't promise a mentally ill person that you'll never leave them.,"It's just fucking cruel.

I first had a best friend who did this, in all fairness it was my fault our relationship downhill but even during that she insisted she'd still be there for me, yet when I eventually decide to try take up the offer to reconnect I'm ghosted.

Then my boyfriend promised me he'd never leave me throughout the 8 months we were together but then he dumps me out of the blue , the half assed stuff he did tell me was likely just because he thought id fucking kill myself if he was truthful. He said he still wants to be there for me but has yet to give off even a sense that he cares, I wouldn't be suprised if he got with the girl he almost cheated on me with right after dumping me.

My point is, never make a promise like this to someone who you know is vulnerable. You KNOW they'll most likely use you as a pillar for support and when you promise them that you'll never leave you give them false hope that crashes down on them twice as hard because of that promise. It's just a fucking cruel thing to do."
jrzoai,depression,ever look back on your life and just wonder what happened to you?,"i used to be so outgoing and carefree. i was content with myself because i didnt really have the capacity at that point to dislike myself at all - like, i didnt really know what that was, and i hadn't really lived much of life at that point to have developed anxiety and other issues. i didnt overanalyse and overthink. i actually used to walk about without this constant pit feeling in my stomach and without anxiety filling up my chest all the time. i genuinely used to be fine, and now im not so much. if i sit for a while and actually, genuinely think about how i physically and emotionally felt and think about my past perception of the world it is so different from how i feel now. and occasionally i'll get a fleeting feeling that reminds me of the contentedness i had when i was younger but it never stays. and it makes me so sad

People will continue to justify life's arbitrary and meaningless cruelty with fantastical explanations. They will continue to center their lives around those fantastical explanations.

By chance of birth, some people will continue to live great lives and others will continue to suffer. The lucky ones will go through life engaged and curious, and the rest will gradually be beaten down by rigidity, conformity, or cruelty.

The endless, toxic, and useless discourse that has come to define online life will not cease.

The universe's countdown to extinction won't stop.

Babies will continue to be born into abuse, never having a chance.

People will continue falling in love, every kiss taunting my lonely time on this Earth. 

In an effort to fight against meaningless absurdity, people will continue to hate and wage war.

Billions of farm animals will continue being bred into existence, with all their capacity to feel pain and terror intact, only to live cramped and miserable lives that end in systematic slaughter.

Romantics will continue to write music and poetry in an attempt to offset the suffering that has come before them and will continue to come after.

I can't take this anymore. We were all born into hell. The lucky ones are the ones who are naive enough to roll their eyes at the preceding sentence. I can't believe I was born with the capacity to feel so much, only to be burned and tortured for such a long time as to only have the negative feelings left intact. I can't believe someone with so many hopes and dreams has no grace bestowed upon him, only the same oblivion that everyone is forced to face sooner or later.

I can't do this anymore. I want to scream but no one will listen. I can't believe the level of helpless agony that so many of us are forced to endure. Why. Just fucking why. I haven't felt loved and safe in 10 years, since I was 17. That's not an exaggeration. I can't fucking believe this is my life.

I was wrong.

Mu grandma, keeps bothering me and lecturing me about how my phone will turn me blind because i look at it everyday.

My sister always scolds me for being so clumsy and disorderly with my stuff.

My mum is dealing with my dad's manic episode and my sister's upcoming national exam. She doesn't have time to deal with me.

They all know I am depressed. And they chose to ignore that fact and treat me like the depression is all ""in your head"".

I use my phone and games as an escapism. I need to distract myself so I won't constantly think abiut depression.

I am so tired of being called lazy. If I had some more energy to get up and do the stuff I like, I would do it. But everyday I feel like my body is deteriorating, and i am slowly sinking without anything to hold onto.

School's not any better. All of my classmates are nice but I just...can't handle the socializing. I hate being contacted. And I can't get anything into my head. I feel like my brain function is shutting down.

8wzyys,depression,People who are depressed should reach out to their friends. *tries to reach out* Nobody replies.,"UPDATE: So, I thought it would only be fair to post this update. While one friend still doesn’t seem to give a fuck, I’m meeting another friend for lunch tomorrow. Turns out she’s been having a thyroid flare up. One other friend also wants to make lunch plans soon so we’ll see about that. Some people care but have stuff going on, other people don’t care. Pay more attention to the former.

Original post:
Seriously, fuck everyone. It’s so easy to say after someone ends their life that they should have reached out to a friend and talked, but who’s really willing to listen? Only a select few of us are blessed with friends who listen with sympathy and respond in a timely way. The rest of them are just faffers. Capitalism has rotten human relationships to the core and everything has become disposable, including friendships. Hang on with dear life to those who really care about you and are willing to talk. More often than not it’s people who have struggled with mental illness themselves.

Edit: It is usually better to talk to a therapist (if you can afford therapy, that is) about issues that friends do not have the professional training to deal with. I don't recommend burdening other people with all your issues because that would just drive them away. People have enough shit in their own lives to deal with. However, it sucks if you want to talk with a 'friend' who clearly knows you're going through a tough time and they don't return your call. 

Edit 2: Looking back at my post I realise I sound a little angry and cynical, but I really wish for a culture where mentally ill people could get the nurturing and support they need. A big part of that is also having access to mental health professionals who are capable and helpful. If you can, please seek the help of a therapist. It has helped me realize where my boundaries with others lie and how I can strengthen my own self to ask of others what I need/deserve from them. It can be a long-drawn process and you might not always land a good therapist at the first attempt. But please persevere if you have the means.

Thanks to everyone for your comments. I’m trying to reply to each one but it’s hard to keep up, so I’m sorry if I miss yours. Remember—you’re worth the effort and the struggle, so please hang in there.

dip94b,depression,I’m fucking sick of my life but I’m too scared to die.,"I just hate everything. I’m so tired of the same old boring life that causes me to suffer. 

Every day I am forced to do things I hate, talk to people I hate, go to places I hate and to put on my fake smile and pretend everything is ok. Lately I have noticed that I’m being irritated by almost everything. I just can’t stand it anymore. 
I hate everyone around me, I hate society, I hate this world, myself and my existence. 

I can’t remember the last time I was honest with someone about the way I feel. If I stop acting like I’m ok and someone notices I’m not feeling well, I’ll just say that I’m tired or my head hurts or other shit like that. It’s not like someone fucking cares about how I feel anyway, it’s all fake and pointless. 

I absolutely hate myself because I’m worthless. I’m ugly, I have no talents except being useless and doing absolutely nothing. I can’t even stand looking at myself in the mirror. 

Everything has lost its meaning lately. Does my existence even matter? If I suddenly disappear it would be better not only for me but for the world as well. 
I don’t even want to pursue my dreams anymore. I don’t want to achieve anything anymore. I just want it all to end. 

I have been thinking of killing myself for a while now, everyone will die when they reach a certain age, what does it matter if it’s now or then?

""depression is just an excuse""

I think I've heard it all at this point. Really if depression doesn't exist, is that why I lay in bed all day starving myself? If depression doesn't exist, is that why I leave the duty that is showering at weeks at a time? I didn't realize being smelly was special and quirky.  If depression doesn't exist, is that why I won't leave my house? Do you honestly think laziness is the reason I was reported as a missing person to the police? If depression doesn't exist, why do I cry when I glance at myself in the mirror. Why am I isolating myself from family and friends? Why did I cut into my wrists? Why did I abuse substances, if depression didn't exist?

&#x200B;

An open letter to all those people out there saying ""just be happy"". That's cute. You've probably had a comfortable life, with parents who loved you. Unlike me, whose relationship with my parents has always been toxic. My dad first invalidated my diagnosis at 16 by saying depression didn't exist. He also threatened to kick me out onto the streets, and then again 2 years after that when my anorexia got worse. He just keeps me around cause I have some leftover money from school and he wants it.

&#x200B;

I've come close to suicide a few times. Once when I was 16 and another time when I was 20. Recently it's been on mind, as I'm hitting new lows, but I don't think I could ever do it cause I'm just so in love with my boyfriend. Though, if he ever betrayed me who knows what I'd do. I don't know myself. It feels like I have no one, except him, and I know what men are like after being cheated on before in past relationships."

I’ve stopped talking to friends and told them I’ll talk to them after Christmas. I don’t feel like pretending to be fine to appease them.

I don’t sleep. I stay up late and wake up early.

kwua1h,depression,I won't kill myself but I do look forward to death,"Just the peace of not existing, no struggles, no problems, no pain. It sounds weird but for me death feels like the light at the end of a long tunnel."
kzq5n5,depression,My parents told me to kill myself,"My anxiety ate me alive this morning I felt awful and fought with my parents about it. They told me to kill myself so after panicking I took my jacket and left my home. I went to the nearest bridge and sat there with my legs out of the bridge, over the water. For the first time I was completely calm. Every other time I attempted I was as scared as hell and that was the reason I couldn’t go trough with it. Probably I would have done it this time. Instead a woman grabbed me from behind and took me back to the bridge. She even took me home scared that I would try again. I don’t even know how I should feel. I don’t know anything anymore

Edit: I wrote this post in the heat of the moment but I just wanted to tell you that my parents really love me, it was just a difficult situation I didn’t know how to calm myself and they didn’t know either. It just degenerated but I know they did not mean it, not even a word. When I came back they were terrified that I could have really killed myself, they were really happy to have me back with them."
anh7tv,depression,Regular Check-In Post,"Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.

We try our best to keep this space as safe and supportive as possible on reddit's wide-open anonymity-friendly platform. The community rules can be found in the sidebar, or under ""Community Info"" in the official mobile apps. If you aren't sure about a rule, [please ask us](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdepression). 

*****

Sorry about letting the last post get archived.  We've been super-busy keeping up with the modqueue and that's slowing down our work on making the community rules more clear and visible and migrated to the standard reddit rules system - we *are* spending all the available time we have on that.  In the meantime, if you're on mobile, please read the info and rules which are under ""Community Info"" on the menu when you're visiting the subreddit.  

I'd like to highlight the most common violations that create extra work for us.  Please use reddit's ""report"" function when you see anything like that.  The exact reasons are less important than the existence of a report, because that puts it in our modqueue where we will look at it first chance we get.  

*  Helpers inviting private contact as a first resort.  Nobody who's both well-meaning and knowledgeable should ever do this.  Please keep your conversations out in the public threads unless/until you've established a solid rapport, and preferably let the OP decide when it's time to go private.   

* ""I'm here to help"" posts.  These are specifically against the rules.  

* Posts that aren't directly relevant to personal experience of depression, the mental illness and/or aren't requests for support.  Everything we do here is based on our core belief that talking about depression is both important and difficult, so we need to be strict about keeping on-topic.  You don't need to have a clinical diagnosis of depression to post here, but, on the other hand, being diagnosed doesn't mean it's okay for you to talk about anything.  For example, depression is *not* loneliness, it's not low self-esteem, and it's not being sad or distressed for good reasons.  Those are all important and serious issues too, and they should be discussed, but this is not the place.  

**Edit:**  I wrote this in a comment reply below but I want to highlight it here:  We enforce the rules as leniently as possible in the case of people who have come here to get support, but strictly in the case of people who are here for any other reason. We think it makes sense to ask people who are giving help to police themselves, but we try to cut people in need of help as much slack as we can without allowing discussions that take focus away from others in need of support. 

If you have concerns or questions about community business or moderation, please talk to us [in modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdepression) before you make a post about it.  

Thanks to everyone for their courage in sharing their struggles, and their kindness in supporting others.  "
kctnhy,depression,"You can't kill yourself, think of your family!","Yup, no shit. Every time I would ever come out as suicidal, that's always the first thing they say. The crutch for my existence is reliant on others wanting me to struggle in the same foggy waters that I've been struggling in for years. I know they're trying to help, but it doesn't help, it just guilts me into a corner and leaves me being perpetually sad all the time. It leaves me with the impression that if I sever ties with everyone to the point where I am, in their eyes, irredeemable garbage, that maybe I'll finally be free from my death causing pain to others. At least that was my impression before I realized the hard way that it would only shift the pain from my death to my actions. So even if I get lucky, and my suicide was clean, It will never be painless. So, for now I'm trapped, there is simply no solution other than think about wanting to die and feeling selfish right after.

Edit: I sympathize for the people in this thread who's parents are part of the problem.  That makes this statement much, much worse. The people trying to help are effectively assuming that you have the same loving parents and probably tell you things about their parents you would kill to have for one day. That sounds like a rusted knife to the chest, and I'm sorry you have to deal with that. To people with worthless, unsupportiave parents, I hope you can get out of that situation as soon as possible and find a support group. And I hope the cretins that drive their kids to suicide eventually receive the same torment that they have dished out."
ep4bw6,depression,I almost feel like I should’ve killed myself a long time ago and now I’m just living out a life that wasn’t meant to happen?,"I feel like the majority of my life so far was a movie of events just happening all leading up to the final end to the movie of me killing myself.  I would just die and I would never have to get to this part of life; it would just happen like that. but now I feel like I missed that chance and my movie is still going but the rest of the movie wasn’t planned out because it should’ve ended with my death so the story is just improvised, and now i feel even more lost and unmotivated than before. (because in all honestly I feel like I tried so hard with school and activities and work etc as one final push before i would kill myself but then I never went through with it and now I’ve given up trying on work and stuff) I don’t know whether others feel this way, but maybe in another alternate reality I did kill myself at the right time and that’s why I feel so wrong because I didn’t. who knows"
honnfe,depression,I don't know myself outside my mental illness,"Is hard to think that I can improve and get better when I've had either anxiety or depression since I was 12. I've read some people that have beat depression as 'getting my old self back' but I don't know how that feels like, idk. It's hard to think that I will ever be able to achieve that when there isnt an 'old me' that actually enjoyed life. 

Having some bad weeks lately, thank you if you read this little rant.

EDIT:   God damn I wasn't expecting all this attention. I'm really new to reddit so I'm just, kind of speechless. I've been reading **all** your comments and advice and let me just say thanks so so much to every single one of you. You took the time to answer and help me when I was feeling sad and hopeless. Even if it was to say that you are in the same situation, you made me feel understood and less alone. I will try to be patient with myself and, as some of you said, work to get better so I can 'discover' myself little by little. It's a long, long road, and right now it seems so hard and impossible, but I will try nonetheless. 
I will continue answering all the comments I can, but I wanted to add this first. 
I hope we all recover and start feeling better soon, you all deserve to be okay. Thanks again to everyone."
a3o9q0,depression,Anyone else feel like depression has made you dumb?,"I feel like I don't think as much anymore, like depression killed all my brain cells. I'm just numb and floating and not interested in anything. I can't remember words very well. Sometimes it literally feels like my head is full of air. 

EDIT: wow I didn't think this would get so much response! I made this post while I was in the middle of a brain fog at work instead of actually doing something important! Now I feel like it had a purpose to help you guys feel less alone. I'm sorry you're all feeling the same way, I know how hard it is. Thank you all for taking the time to share your experiences, it really made me feel less alone.

I truly don't think any of us are dumb or stupid or whatever you want to call it. We just have to recognise that it's this horrible disease doing it to us. I wish I could hug each one of you individually <3"

Hope you are all doing well or if not that things get better for you <3

I know this post will be ignored but at least I tried. At least I tried to get help from my parents, friends, school, hotlines, reddit but nobody wants to help. The only person I had left was my bf but yesterday he just said he feels like all he is is a therapist to me. It really broke my heart into a million pieces. Because I dont have anybody else to talk to and he always said it was okay for me to vent to him. 

My parents called me a freak and a weirdo, said that I need to snap out of this and get over myself, after they saw my stupid blog about my depression when I was 13 (idk why I made that - 13 yr old me was questionable) they got enraged. When they saw my self harm at 14 they got really mad. The tension in the house and the shame was unbearable, I couldnt look at them in the eyes and spent most of my time hiding in my room. Now I act like I'm fine and happy all the time, we talk about other stuff and joke and laugh together, and its massively improved our relationship. I'm grateful to have parents I now get along with. But it's only because I hide my mental health. Lately things have gotten so bad, its getting hard for me to hide it from them. I'm forgetting to do things they told me to, I'm losing things they lent to me, they're getting pissed off when I didnt mean to. I'm not doing this on purpose. Got mad because I didnt phone my grandma to thank her for some money. Of course it came across as rude and I felt so guilty. My whole family probably thinks I dont care about them. I feel like shit but they dont want to know the truth.

My friends - they all have it bad. Bad home lives, mental health problems, every single one of them, and I'm always trying to help them. But when I tried to open up they treated it like a competion and didnt even ask what was up with me just said they had it worse. I havent spoken to them in weeks because I'm so depressed and nobody even checks up on me to see how I am. It's hard to pretend im happy and smiling and laughing so I dont talk to them. I'm not okay but they're not in the right place to help me they need help themselves.

It's getting really hard to socialise. I talk to my boyfriend everyday and it's just so so so hard to talk and do normal things with him, I try to cover up how bad I'm hurting but sometimes I crack, he said it was okay for me to vent anytime but it looks like I did it too much and he says he feels like a therapy buddy. I feel so fucking shit that I cant even get my shit together.

School is so difficult. I log onto my live lessons and sit there and listen to my tutor saying ""mental health matters guys!"" When their school counsellor wont even bother to show up. Time and time again the school counsellor has cancelled on me LAST MINUTE or during class when we cant use our phones, or just simply not been there. My mental health doesn't fucking matter to the school does it. They say ""its really important we look after our wellbeing"" so they suggest going out for a walk, breathing, taking breaths and ""talking to someone"", well we already know that's not fucking possible. But the other tips are just really basic level things, they don't bother to invest deeper into mental health and help people with genuine problems because they might not have superhero parents that can get them to the doctors or therapists, they only tell us how to ""look after our wellbeing"" when I'm doing all those things and it's gone beyond that. I'm REALLY doing badly. And they dont care. They just expect you to get on with it. So I get told off for not participating in my live lessons. Well I'm sorry that I tried to reach out for help because you said mental health matters and yet I got nothing so you now you expect me to act okay and surprise surprise I cant fucking do it. I cant switch off my mental health for you, school. There is no place in school for people like me when they expect you to be motivated, high achieving, focused, participating, just always okay, and I cant do it!!! And I know this will transfer into the real world, the working world, they always expect you to be okay. And it's not like I want to walk around looking all miserable, but it's just getting so hard to keep that happy mask on all the time.

I have a university interview coming up soon. I dont know if I can do it. I'm so broken and suicidal that I dont think I can act all enthusiastic and persuade them I'd be a great, passionate, hardworking student when I can barely do my schoolwork and struggle to even get out of bed, dress myself and eat.

Theres so many signs I'm struggling. And nobody cares. If you're lucky, they will say they do, they spit out the cliches, give you the useless suicide hotline number and move on with their lives. In most circumstances you have to shut up and act like you're okay your whole life. There is no place in the world for people like me."
iqxdhj,depression,I’m so disappointed in myself,"I suck at everything in my life even if I try to work my hardest. I pushed myself too hard in the past and now I’m too exhausted. Slowly rotting away on the inside. I’m not the person I once was. I have forgotten who that was anyway. All that’s left is a depressed, anxious mess."
ki4i70,depression,"Do you also feel like this, totally neutral and absolutely bored with life, feeling that nothing has real substance and colour ?"," 

Hello folks, I feel a certain way since years and I try to muffle it as hard as I can but it's getting impossible and I wanna know if you feel like this too, or what is it.

I've always found interest in quite everything and i've tried to do everything around me that I was actually able to (psychologically or physically speaking).  
But I can't get invested in anything I do. Any activities that I do are short and if they go on for too long I get bored.  
I force myself to do quite everythings, I force myself to feel emotions (like happiness when I get a gift or happiness when I win on games) and the only emotions that are spontaneous and ""real"" from me are frustration and absolute void.  
When I don't force myself to live emotions out of peer pressure, I feel absolutely neutral and quite sad about life.  
Everything seems washed out and boring, literally everything.  
Nothing stimulates me or give me a feeling of pleasure or joy.  
Nothing really interests me and I feel like i've done everything that I HAD to do in my life and I only see one option now : that it's over !  
(I don't wanna suicide even if sometimes I think about it, I won't do it because I don't want to but it just feels like life is meaningless now and it's the only logical choice)  
I got the checklist done, everything else is purely boring and non stimulating, so I don't really wanna live anymore.  
Because literally everything that I do makes me suffer, even writing this text.  
Because I feel like it's useless and boring.

Is that just depression in a way ?"
g2ojjp,depression,My dad told me stop being depressed because it's embarrassing him.,"Last year On November 21 I attempted to kill myself and winded up in hospital the next day , I was still drowsy from the pills I overdosed on and could barely see let alone hear a thing .
 I was so weak I couldn't even walk , I had to use a wheelchair, I went to the hospital bathroom (still in the drowsy state ) and came back to find both my parents sitting by my hospital bed .

Keep in mind my mom is a single mom and has been raising me for years now , I only saw my day once and at most 5 times a year so I was not expecting him . I got to the bed , sat down and my mom gave me a very worried and concerned look but befire she could say anything my dad open his mouth ...

His exact words were , ""Stop being depressed,  it's embarrassing me and I don't want to deal with your nonsense ."" 
That broke my heart , I knew he didn't care but I didn't think it was that bad , I was still in my drowsy state but the moment he said that I think I might be woken up a little . The rest of the conversation with them was a blur but I just remember being so fixated on what he said to me .

That was the last time we spoke , he didn't even wish me a happy birthday this year . I'm only 14 , he broke what little hope I had of us finally reuniting as daughter and dad , I didn't have alot of hope to begin with but damn.


Edit : Thanks for all the positive comments .I didn't the the post would get as much attention as it did with that being said  I'm thankful , you guys were so nice and supportive in the comments .  

To those who have gone/ are doing through something similar or even worse  ,  I sincerely hope you get better , you are loved and appreciated and from the bottom of my heart I'd like to say that you are cared for and  I'm so sorry if anything makes you feel weak or not good enough . 
You are worth it and you are strong and if you feel you are being invalidated and ignored please talk to someone , there will always be someone who cares about you're mental health ."
clhszv,depression,I no longer believe in the myth that any challenge can be overcome with hard work alone.,"I used to believe that if someone tried hard enough they could do anything, I no longer believe that. I think hard work, wit, the help of others, and luck can allow someone to succeed in their endeavors but not hard work alone. This was quite a blow to me. I'm trying to replace this myth with something else at the moment."
jvl099,depression,I'm only 19 but feel like I'm already in a mid life crisis.,"It's weird that I'm only 19 and feel like this. I started working straight out of high school 2 years ago.

I see people hang out all the time and go to lunch together, I just sit by myself like usual. I just feel stuck, doing the same boring retail work daily, while having no friends or anything to look forward to my weekends. Even gaming is starting to feel dull, I browse my gaming library for hours and end up watching youtube and sleeping. I just feel stuck and trapped in this situation. I'm almost considering joining the army just to get out of my situation and re-start my life, meet new people and do something I would be proud of..."

ec1rel,depression,If I knew what I know now I would've just killed myself when I was 14,"All this pain and suffering, hurting other people, wasting people's time, dragging myself through life just to be in the same place 8 years later.

e3g6bw,depression,I never understood why the suicide rates went up during Christmas time... now I do.,"I've always had depression, for as long as I can remember. But this year it's getting a bit worse I might say. I'm kinda in a haze, it's all foggy, my brain feels like cotton, I'm numb and in pain. I'm here but at the same time I'm not, I'm not myself anymore. The depression is choking me, the anxiety is killing me. I don't want Christmas to come this year.   
I  have this feeling that I don't want to be here to celebrate Christmas this year. People are nagging me about what I want for Christmas... I have no answer, because I don't need or want anything and I don't want to be here to open them anyway. Whenever I get a present from someone, I just feel guilty. Because trashy people like me doesn't deserve it, I just feel like a burden for everyone around me. I'm a waste of space, waste of oxygen. The guilt of taking up space is getting worse by the minute.   
I've told most people in my family I don't want any presents this year. They don't know it's because of the guilt. I'm tired of all the guilt! Guilt for breathing, existing, for being stupid and just for being me.  
People around me has been decorating for Christmas these past few days, I haven't. I don't care and I don't see the point.  I don't want to celebrate Christmas this year. I see no point. No joy, no happiness, no... nothing.   
Now I understand why people kill themselves around Christmas. 

My lack of will to live is kinda scary. It's never been so deep and strong before. The fact that January is gonna be financially hell doesn't exactly make it better. I don't want to live to experience January. I can't, I can't afford it. I can't handle it! Oh here we fucking go again, my brain is getting on overdrive and running around again. Push it away, just push the thoughts away. Cut, bleed and shut off my brain.   
Merry fucking Christmas to me."
dgy2td,depression,I hate it when people say “well occupy yourself” when you’re depressed.,"People often say to take your mind off depression, go do something. Play music, focus on school, etc. But the issue is that these are all just blank substitutes that comes crashing down. Just as alcohol is a temporary fix (although it is destructive), using music, exercise, etc is JUST as pointless. I work out and then I feel great and then afterwards, I remember my situation and my life and I feel depressed again. If it’s not resolved, NO amount of “substitutes” can help. All these activities are are just temporary bandages on a wound that can’t close.

Edit: wow I didn’t expect this to get so many likes. My first post with over 1k likes! I’m happy to know that so many of you can relate with me in this way."
deg7r3,depression,I don’t want to kill myself but sometimes I want to stop existing.,"I wish there was an off switch that could be turned back on at will, ya know? Like a less permanent way to disappear. Just get off the grid for a while but then come back once I’m feeling better. Is it just me?"
ive8e5,depression,I am the singer of a pretty well known band and I struggle with suicidal thoughts every day,"Hi everyone. Like I said in the title, I am the singer of a pretty well known (european) band. Before this year we had shows almost every other week. It's fun, rewarding, great in almost every aspect. When I am on stage I am unbeatable, unkillable. But as soon I get off, I rarley talk to my bandmates, try and avoid fans and get as drunk as I possibly can. I wouldn't say that I have a problem with alchohol since I rarely drink unless it's after a show or a special occasion. I currently live with my gf of 1(soon to be 2) years. I love her but I can't talk to her about my feelings. Whenever I try to be open with her I get cold feet and chicken out.

I suffer, like many of you, in silence. My life might seem pretty alright from the outside, but from the inside I just want to fucking die. My music is embodiment of my feelings, hatred, sadness. Sure that helps me vent but I cannot for the life of me escape myself.

I also have an evil circle hanging over my head. I need to feel this hatred and sadness and shit and bile in my soul to be able to write. If I feel happy, on the rare occasion, I can't write. And if I can't write, I can't perfom.. See my problem? I want to be the embodiment of my art. I want to experience this pain to be able to write and perform it. This comes at the price of wanting to die every single day. How can I escape or deal with my emotions, when I use them to make a living?

&#x200B;

Edit: I am moved by everyones effort to help. I can't do much to thank you but here is a poem that I wrote a while back. It won't rhyme in english but I hope that doesn't bother you.

&#x200B;

You hold the suns warmth in your hand

when you touch me I become your man

to be thawn is not easy

the cold bites and doesn't feel right

if you've been frozen for all these years

a layer of ice to cover the wounds

you melt my heart you melt my soul

unlocks life and a whole new world

I love you with all my power

even though I never told you

&#x200B;

with the sun's rays dawns a new day

but there was something you didn't want to say

for cold winds can troubble a flame

you wanted to tell but not to hurt

when the warmth had gotten so weak

you said that it was I who had ended the day

that the frost and ice had put out your flame

you left no please stay

for a sun needs fuel and a spark

a chill needs only a coffin"

izn5op,depression,I finally went to see a psychiatrist and he straight up told me I don’t have a mental illness.,"I’m sorry if I sound mad and this is a rant, I’m fucking furious. 

So after 3 months of waiting, many years of putting all of this off, I finally get to see a psychiatrist. I drove 2 hours to get here, spent 20 bucks on parking, and I was told to fuck off. 

This guy could barely speak English, but all he talked about was how cannabis is bad and all my problems are from cannabis.  

I’ve been smoking daily for 2 years now, and Ill admit, it is a problem. But I’ve literally been dealing with mental health issues my whole life. 

He wouldn’t even let me speak and when I did he was just drawing on his notepad. He would just tell me that it’s cannabis and I need to go to rehab and once I stop smoking I’ll be fine. 

Bitch, I’m not fucking fine. 

There were so many things I needed to talk about, I literally think I have autism, and when I brought it up he didn’t even acknowledge it. I wanted to talk about anxiety issues and ADHD and ptsd, but apparently I have none of those and it’s just cannabis.  

My favourite part of the whole meeting was when he told me I just need a mom. I literally responded with, “well no shit, but my mom literally just died a few months ago so that’s not really an option.”

I’m so fucking pissed. My life is literally going to go no where and I’m never going to get help, so this is fucking fun.


Edit, thanks for all the support guys, I’ve got another doctors appointment set up to see a new psychiatrist so that’s cool. 

Please stop upvoting and commenting haha, I never wanted to get this much attention and only wanted the 3 people that usually respond lol"

juifes,depression,25 years old with absolutely no friends,"I'm a 25-year-old girl. I'll just get straight to the point. I have no friends, no boyfriend, nothing. Somehow I was the popular girl in class (I'm doing masters), and I was always surrounded by a huge group of ""friends"". All that changed this quarantine. I began to see how much I was never really needed in these people's lives. It first hit me on my birthday - the people I thought were close to me, didn't even bother doing a video call for me, or even send anything on my birthday. This was in stark contrast to another girl's birthday in the group - they all had a video call (I was told to join), made a loving video for her (compilation of clips and pictures), and had a small virtual party for her.

This really hurt me, and over the next few months, I saw them drifting more and more away. Now, this has been the pattern for ""friends"" throughout my life - my work friends, and even school friends. These all are people I was immensely close to at one point.   But now I'm not in touch with anyone. Whenever I do try to strike up conversations, they just humor me for a few minutes before ending the conversation. Or other times, they are already close with each other as a group and I feel like an outsider.

Another thing - whenever I thought I was best friends with someone, they instantly replaced me with someone bubblier, more extroverted, or more ""fun"" within months. This has happened to me since my school days. It hurt me a lot but I didn't speak about it for fear of looking desperate or being ridiculed. So I bottle it all in. An incident that will be always etched in my mind is something that happened on my 22nd birthday - my boyfriend at the time had broken up with me, and I was all alone. There was a girl who I naively thought was my best friend up until that time. I ended up buying and taking a cake to her place in the hopes that we would celebrate my bday, or maybe she had something planned for me (she did it for all her other friends). When I got there, she looked surprised and very very much like she pitied me. She hadn't even remembered my birthday.

It's come to the point that legit the only people that truly care for me and have time for me are my parents. That's it.

Idk what I'm trying to say with this post. Is there anyone out there who feels or experiences the same thing as me? How do you deal with it?

EDIT: I'm literally crying my eyes out with the support that's pouring in and the stories you all are sharing. I had no idea there are so many people who feel the same way as me. I'm at a loss for words seriously you guys are the best, thank you for making me feel like I'm not absolutely alone.

82f2i9,depression,Does anyone else feel like they only staying alive for other people,I hate the saying suicide is selfish because no one ever congratulates you for staying alive for others despite how fucking exhausting it is to simply exist. I've been depressed for past several years but one thing I've always had is my family which I'm grateful for and also ashamed to be depressed because how fucking dare I not be happy with all I have. Anyway I've purposely hid this from them because I don't want them to think of me as anything but the class clown type who's always seemingly upbeat and has his life together. The fascade is exhausting. I've wanted to die for a while but simply cannot bear to put my folks through especially my younger brothers who wouldn't even understand. Maybe this is enough maybe this will push me through until I get better.

And my roots never grow.

Why won't these stupid roots just fucking grow?!

c6tkci,depression,Every time you open up about depression people always feel the need to invalidate it,"It happens every time. They say to reach out if you're struggling but as soon as you do everybody lets you down. People either make it a competition about who has it worse, or try and tell you that you don't have ""real"" depression. Another one is when people downplay your condition saying there are people who have it worse. For some reason it always happens with this illness. Can this stop already?"

e3vb1f,depression,"12 months ago, I tried to kill myself. 3 seconds, that’s how long the EMT says I was gone for.. My body is suddenly getting flashbacks to that moment and it hurts.","I took three bottles of various pills in my cupboard, downed a fifth of tequila, and put a pipe to my car’s exhaust into the driver’s side window and cried tears of joy that it was finally going to be over.

I passed out and woke up in the ambulance strapped to a gurney, confused, sobbing, and hysterical. My housemate got home early and found me. I was admitted into the ICU, spent my birthday, Christmas, New Years, etc in the psych ward for three months going through ECT.

All I can think of lately is not messing up this time. It hurts because I’m a perfectionist, and I couldn’t get it right."
l8pmo2,depression,My life in a nutshell;,"Having anxiety and depression is like being scared and tired at the same time. 
It's the fear of failure but no urge or will to be productive.
It's wanting friends but hate socializing.
It's wanting to be alone but not wanting to be lonely.
It's caring about everything just to abruptly care about nothing.
It's the feeling of feeling everything at once then feeling paralysingly numb.
It's wanting to get help, but subconsciously knowing it won't make a difference because you can't see the light at the end of the tunnel, you are just tired of being in the tunnel."

citae8,depression,I don't feel like I have any genuine friendships or relationships with anyone anymore.,"I don't know if these are just symptoms of depression, but I feel so distant from people that I used to consider friends. They never come in contact with me and I can't bring myself to contact them either, and when I do, it's often just short lived conversations or I end up being left on read. My main circle of friends kind of broke off, and now they never seem to plan anything with me. I feel so alone, but at the same time, it feels so hard to talk to people or even get out and try to meet others. As for finding new friendships and relationships, I feel like I've met someone but I find it so hard to trust them and I feel so scared all the time that it's never going to work out or if they're even interested. I honestly feel like I'm not even a priority for them but I feel so guilty and self-absorbed for feeling this way. I don't know if I should tell them because it might make me feel clingy. I don't know what to do and I feel hopeless.

e0r6a9,depression,The most depressing part about turning 30 is when you start thinking “this really is my life after all”,"When you’re 18, you can make mistakes. You have the time to fix them. They don’t define the rest of your life. You have a decade + to build a life for yourself. There is always that hope that one day, things might turn out well for you. There is excitement. Life is full of colour, but off in the distance you see a storm and road in greyscale.

Then you turn 30 and suddenly the road ahead that looked dark and stormy ahead of you IS the road you’re now walking down. And all you can see is darkness for the next 50 years of your life.  Nobody is coming to save you or bail you out. 

I would give anything to go back and do things over. But there is no reset button, you can’t start a new save file. All you can do is turn off the game.

For people in their late teens/early twenties - don’t waste a moment. Appreciate the time you are living in and the fact that you have several important years to work with. They disappear without warning and one day, it will hit you like a fucking dump truck in the chest that you have lost them forever."

jc93qc,depression,My therapist thinks I'm too depressed for therapy,"So my therapist that I've only seen two times thinks I'm not a good candidate for therapy. She thinks that I'm too depressed for it despite being on heavy medications that I'm going to see a doctor about and re-evaluate in a few weeks.

She didn't think that a combination of psychotherapy and medications combined would work for me. Instead She suggested ECT treatment after only talking for 80 minutes total.

After doing extensive research this is only offered AFTER you have tried a combination of both therapy and meds and have psychotic symptoms and have a high risk for suicide, all of which I don't have. 

I am severely depressed but my life is incredibly stable for the first time in my life. I know how to handle my depression and my anxiety and do so very well (which she agreed on, mind you) but she still thinks I'm too depressed and she's afraid therapy might make it worse. 

I've done CBT before (only for my anxiety) so I am well aware it might get much worse before it gets better. Yet the CBT was very successful and no matter how hard it got and how badly I wanted to quit, I still showed up for every single appointment and did every homework I got. 

I am not a quitter nor will I ever be. 

All I want is some help to get better without frying my brain. Is that too much to ask for? Am I unreasonable for thinking that psychotherapy and trauma therapy might be a good place to start?

Does anyone else feel like your head is a fog? or like your living a video game (controlling all the moments and decisions but not emotionally attached) The feeling of un-motivation, detachment and numbness has only gotten worse (i'm 21 now). I notice myself making poor decisions due to lack of caring and foresight (even though i know what the outcome will be) Sometimes even as far as not being able to think, as if my brain is just a static tv.

I sorta expected a very stigmatized reaction for some reason. The first professor blew up on me in immediate concern for my well-being. He too had actually been through similar circumstances when he was younger. And the second professor, he had a close friend who was suicidal and very depressed as well. He was very calm throughout the whole conversation actually. That was a really fucking cool thing to have a legit chat about mental health with college professors. 

Edit: I really can't express enough how reassuring all of your supportive comments are. I would like everyone to know that I actually just recently started therapy for the first time this semester. And it is doing wonders. Hopefully I get the courage to schedule with the on campus psychiatrist soon to see if medication can help.

I'm 27 now. No friends, no girlfriend, I lost my job recently due to a work injury... the life never really got better. I'm no longer being bullied by other kids, I'm being bullied by my own head. Every year is another wasteful, unfulfilling stepping-stone on the road to death.

c3whma,depression,"I've been left out of everything, and someone actually cared.","So, basically, my school is crap.

Teachers don't care about me being left out or bullied half of my time here. I didn't think the students did, until today.

There was an odd number of girls today since one was off, and we had to go into pairs. Of course, none wanted to go with me and neither did any one of the boys. So, I sat at the side and said I was fine not doing it.

However, one of the boys asked why I couldn't go in a three with one of the girls' pairs (if you couldn't tell I'm female, and in my school girls and boys don't like to go together much), but all of them said ""no this is a paired activity""

So he actually got really mad and called them all assholes and said how he noticed how they all treat me like shit and asked if I wanted to go in his pair.

He got a detention (just at lunch break) for swearing in front of the teacher and multiple small children passing by, but it honestly warmed my heart so much and it showed me that maybe there is some good left in humanity, and that someone actually cares.

It was the first time I'd felt happy in a long time, to be honest."

I think the only thing that motivates me is my anxiety and guilt. So it is not like I get things done because I'm feeling any optimism about life or a will to live

It makes it worse that every time I talk to my partner about it, she always twists it into some underlying meaning that I don’t want to be with her. And I get livid that she’s made it about her. Maybe I am just selfish and attention-seeking. "
kdpiwa,depression,I plan to kill myself tonight with a plastic bag (suffocation),"I'm 14
my mom doesn't take my mental health seriously and ignores what I've tried to tell her. And the reason why I want to commit suicide? Because of my life, my family, school. My mom says everyday that I'm useless, dumb, why can't I be like my brother. She says I'm a disappointment, why didn't see listen to the dreams from Jesus about me being a horrible daughter, how she wished she could abort me when she got the chance. My dad doesn't even do anything to stop my mom. My mom earlier this year pushed me on the floor, and choked me because she was really angry. I feel worthless, and pathetic. I have no friends at school, everyone ignores me, and I have zero social skills, how fun. My extended family doesnt even like me, my mom tells them heavily exaggerated stories about me that makes me look like a bad person. I'm failing math because I dont get any of the material, I tried seeking help, but my dad gets fed up with me not keeping up at his learning pace. I'm ugly, and skinny. My cousins make fun of my body, saying how I look like a flat stick. And on top of that, I can't even think straight anymore, suicidal thoughts and urges have basically took over my life. I feel like the odd person always, I feel disgusted with myself. Like I can't even look at myself without all these negative thoughts flooding in. I'm lonely, 0 social life. I've been dealing with this for 5 years, I cant take it anymore. Im burned out. I have no motivation to keep going. And before you say ""Your family will be sad"" I do not care. I am done. Maybe when I die I can finally seek the revenge I deserve. I just want to die, I'm still surprised that I lived to my 14th birthday. My mom says to ""Pray that I get better"" Or that I'm not reading enough of the bible. I'm SICK of it. She says a demon has probably took over me because I feel the way I feel. She knows that I'm deppressed and won't let me see a therapist. I hope that she can stop my brother from having the same fate as me. I'm sorry."
elycos,depression,Do you ever feel like depression set you back a few years?,"I'm a sophomore in college right now and I am constantly surrounded by wise people... People who did things with their lives in high school and didn't waste it away crying, starving themselves, neglecting their work... They were able to partake in extracurriculars in spite of nervousness or not being nervous at all. They were able to accomplish things efficiently without attention or memory issues. They were able to make friends without poor social cues.

I had friends who manipulated me and threatened to commit suicide everyday, and even then I never had positive influences to help me. My parents were so busy with work that since my youth I was always alone at home. I have trouble having fun... I can't emotionally feel like a happy person, it's always forced. It doesn't come naturally to me so people didn't like people like me.

I'm too lazy to write this but basically I feel so bitter. I wish I did more so I could show off my potential but nope, I wasn't certain of myself ever. I'm trying to improve but my past latches onto me. ): Sigh.

Edit: I have something to add. First, I am very happy to see that some people can relate to at least the topic sentence of this post. We all feel like we were taken back by years because of some shitty stuff in my past. I also didn't get to finish writing this (because I hadn't the energy to finish) but there were moments where I stopped eating, showering, and brushing my teeth for very long periods of time. I also hid my feelings all the time. When people used to say, ""You don't understand!"" it would hurt so much because I really did in some way, or so I thought. I had speech therapy in middle school and general therapy in high school but I was never very honest because I was always afraid of the consequences. I feel a little bit of pride I guess saying this but I feel like I'm an example of someone who hid all their feelings and just wants it all, like all vomited and shat and sweated and cried out of me until I can remove it completely. Nowadays I struggle to even read sometimes, I just don;t have the strength, but I try.

I do say though writing this was therapeutic because I am severely overwhelmed saying this but thanks for reading."

len5sx,depression,I know the post will go down here ... But I have serious problems. I should quit my life.,"First of all ... I have hesitated for a long time just to write everything that burdens me, but maybe it helps just to get rid of everything once. 

About me, 31 years old, I am psychologically completely broken and physically unfortunately also very lediert. 

My life has just gone wrong from the beginning and sometimes I wonder if some people are just lucky and others are not. 

I grew up in an already broken family. My mother was married 3x and divorced 3x (I am the child of the second husband). I can remember almost all the incidents of my childhood (which makes it worse for me) One of the first memories I have (about 3,5 years) my father went after my mother with a knife. And even stabbed through a door with a knife. He was then thrown out by my grandparents and I saw him only once a short time later. He was an alcoholic all his life and did not even try to contact me (even when my ex-wife met him by chance in the hospital 10 years ago and gave him my cell phone number...). Without my knowledge)

In the meantime he passed away about 2 months ago and I knew nothing about him except that he was an alcoholic. 

After he was no longer there, my mother had quickly met someone new, my stepfather. He was 8 years younger than my mother. 

Unfortunately, he was also very aggressive. As a chain smoker he was very quickly annoyed when he had no more cigarettes and has quickly become with things around him, it also did not take long and my mother and he have often and loudly quarreled, often thrown on dishes on the walls. He became unfortunately also now and then Handgreiflich and has beaten me and my brother (whereby my brother was rather his favorite, since he was older and could make more with him). After we have moved several times we lived in a townhouse only then it did not take long that my mother and my stepfather have also divorced. My stepfather had cheated on my mother for a long time with my cousin (yes it does not get better).

After the separation, my stepfather has emptied the joint account and has filed for bankruptcy, because no one could keep the house alone, my mother also had to file for bankruptcy. 

Shortly after that we moved of course, unfortunately my mother lost her job 3 years later and has never found a full-time job again and lives since then on social benefits. 

With my brother (child of my first husband and 3 years older than me) I never had a really good relationship, mostly he didn't want to have anything to do with me and we generally did less together. He was also not at the same school as me, he was never very educated unfortunately. 

He also moved out quite early, because he did not get along with our mother at all and even resented that she separated from our stepfather (because he got along with him). He then moved to another cousin of ours until he was 18 and even had contact with our stepfather. 

Generally he was always very strange. He watched our parents having sex or generally our mother taking a shower. (And played with himself while doing so). He is also said to have had sex with our cousin according to a friend of his. (Probably several times) And has often set fire with a friend together.

He somehow had a kind of mother complex and for many years always looked for much older women who often also had children. But usually it did not last very long. When it was over, he often set a fire somewhere. What I knew about afterwards was his own car, A garden shed, A meadow, and finally an attic of an apartment building, whereupon he was arrested and sentenced. However only on probation. 

His last partner was 11 years older than him with whom he actually held out for 6 years. Only a short time later he had a partner 11 years younger (a complete change of heart). Which was then suddenly pregnant immediately, after the first child a few weeks later she was pregnant again. 

However I had in the people 10 years very very rarely contact with my brother and we have seen us actually only when our grandparents died (who have reached a proud age 92 and 94).

In general, I have also completely broken off contact in the meantime, because after several attempts on my part, no normal relationship can develop between us. I can not even have a reasonable conversation with him, because you just notice he seems to be very stupid (I just can not express it differently).

About me .. I also made a lot of mistakes in life. 

Unfortunately for me, I almost didn't focus on my schooling and did almost nothing in class (my mom didn't care what I did or didn't do anyway, she never showed up for a parent-teacher conference either). 

I wanted to earn money as fast as possible and learned the next best thing and ended up in the camp. My goal though was to become a soldier and joined the army after my training, unfortunately I got a slipped disc there and dropped out 2 years later. 

Then I ended up in a larger company where I had worked until today. 

I started drinking myself very early (15 years), because I myself had a very bad environment, the city I lived in generally had high unemployment and there was a lot of drug dealing. Also through my education I drank almost every day after work and it was later to the point that I completely shut down 4 times a week and had a blackout several times. This was no better in the armed forces. Was able to make the leap in my mid 20's though and quit. I don't even drink beer in between anymore because I just don't feel like it. I also take my other drugs (although I sometimes wonder if maybe I should). Or smoke either.

I have always tried in my life to escape into some relationships, because I could not be alone ... My first relationship lasted 5 years circa and I was married myself and had to divorce and have a son. 

My ex-wife, however, always wanted to make life difficult for me and I got deeply into debt because of her, since she, among other things, never completed an education. Just like that, she quit her jobs and I was the sole breadwinner and often signed contracts and did not pay them, whereupon I received debt collection letters. 

I had to declare insolvency at some point, because we also had a joint loan running.

I had also met a new woman half a year later and moved. Only my ex-wife really sabotaged this relationship and it didn't last long. Also because I wanted to see my son regularly.

I then decided to stay alone for 2 years, but lived near my ex-wife again because of my son. 

When I met my current partner, I decided to finally live my own life and not always be there for others. And moved a little further away. Got another wonderful daughter and everything looked like it was going uphill.

Also this time my ex-wife has tried to make our life hell, which led to the fact that I have quarreled with my partner very often and now also have no contact with my son for a year. 

My job has also deteriorated more and more, because the company was bought up 3x and changed. The work climate has made me more and more broken and I had a second herniated disc. 

In addition, I was then admitted to a day clinic, because I was also psychologically at the end. After a few months there, I was diagnosed with trauma therapy and was also diagnosed with bipolar narcism. 

I discontinued this therapy a year later because it didn't help me at all.

In the meantime, however, I have screwed everything up ... I had to give up my job for health reasons, although I have a GDB of 30% and was equalized. I am also about to lose my partner, because there is more and more crisis between us. I really don't have anyone in my life anymore. 

I have moved 13 times in my life in general. And have lost a lot of contacts and friends. I also lost some contacts because of my ex-wife. 

I generally only have contact with some friends I met online or old work colleagues. 

I also see my mother about 1-2 times a year but I don't care if I see her at all or not. But she understandably wants contact with her grandchildren.

I must also say to myself, I was a very difficult personality from a certain point and also my friends and partners had to learn to deal with it. I always had the urge to somehow talk nonsense and can hardly ever stay serious about anything, even when I write this text. You could subordinate it under ""joke addiction or Moria"". I also have a very low frustration threshold and go crazy quickly if I just drop something. Unfortunately I'm also very forgetful and often don't know what I'm supposed to do several times a day. (I probably owe that to the alcohol). All in all, due to narcism I often have the impression of being emotionally dead. I cry in the rarest situation at all (even if sad videos still carry me away). I can hardly show empathy towards others. I also really don't care about much and I notice it more and more. That I really don't care about anything that happens. Apart from my children, I have never really had the feeling of being happy. In general, almost nothing good has ever happened to me. 

Conclusion: So now I wonder does it even make sense for me to exist? 

I am insolvent I have a divorce behind me. My partner will leave me soon. I have no job anymore. No friends . And probably soon no more apartment (since I then the insolvent also no new apartment more find). 

EDIT: 

First of all, thank you all! 

You have really touched my heart, even if it is hard for me to admit something like that. 

You don't have to worry about me doing anything to myself! 

I don't want my children to have a horrible childhood like me! 

Besides, for your love! You are really great and I understood that there are things in life worth living for! 
Of course, I will also seek professional help. 
It is not very easy to get appointments here but I will keep at it and not give up! 
I know I can't change my past but I can change my future!

My inbox has exploded with messages and I have already replied to some. Even if I wanted to, I probably won't manage to reply to every single one.

Thanks again you are great!

ira8be,depression,I ruined my own life by being an overwhelmingly anxious idiot.,"Can't go into details too much for privacy sake but I'm really falling apart. My relationship, my friendships, my happiness, all gone. All because I acted upon my own anxieties and panicked. 

I wish I had listened to what people told me to do, maybe my life wouldn't be all broken. 

I want to cry everyday. I want to die everyday. Everyday is a battle between wanting to be a better man for myself and those around me and wanting to die. 

I don't know how much longer I can take this, but I hope I'm still here, for my daughter's sake.

EDIT: this is wild. didn't think this would get a lot of attention. i posted this as a means of putting it out there instead of bottling it in, and i'm glad a lot of people resonated with this. 

everything sucks, but my daughter is the only thing that's keeping me going. i hope everyone has that one thing that motivates them to keep going. much love."
g99heb,depression,Casually Suicidal,"Do you ever look at yourself in the mirror and think about death? You think about the consequences of it and what people's views are on it. Maybe you have even considered suicide. You brush it off, most likely. That is what most people do. People are scared. I am scared. Who would actually want to die though, right? This is what casually being suicidal is. Can you have suicidal thoughts and want to die at the same time? I have a fear of death. I always have, always will. How is it that some days I want everything to end, but I don’t at the same time? It's my biggest fear but also my biggest relief, my biggest wish. In reality, I just want the pain to stop. Why is everything so difficult? Sure, you would tell me to go get therapy, go get tested by a psychologist or something. As if that advice means anything. You want to label us, as if everyone feels the same thing, people like this are the same. In some ways, sure, they are. But most people don’t want to die, they want it to stop. What, exactly, do they want to stop? People. People are predictable. What other reasons are there for someone to want to go as far as think these awful thoughts? Even good people turn bad. Everyone is bad. Even me. People tell you to talk to others about these feelings, that it will help. But only people who experience these kinds of thoughts would understand, and even then it would give them this negative thing to relate to. Is that really a good thing? To relate, in wanting to die? Back to my point, what can people do? I can’t call myself depressed, because I’m not sad all the time. I can’t say I have anxiety, because I’m not anxious all the time. It goes on. The point of this paragraph is to say, don’t tell people to ask for advice, or say that you understand what they are going through. I always tell people what I’m going through, they brush it off. Talking about it can help. But only for the right people. For people like me, I don’t exactly know if I have specific mental health to blame everything on. I’m just feeling like this, that’s all.

lo67kq,depression,It sucks that I have to pay the price for the abuse caused to me,"It's so fucked up. Despite enduring abuse from my home environment, and relentless bullying at school I'm the one who has to pay the price. I'm the one who has to pay for the therapy sessions, I'm the one who had to move out and pay for the cost of living at age 17.   


It's so fucked up. Despite this, people expect me to just ""get on with life"". I'm treated as if ""Yeah we all have shit going on, just get on with it"". They don't realise how hard it is for me to get through a week doing basic activities, let alone finish getting a degree.   


Basic tasks like walking in the city and hearing people laugh is stressful for me. I automatically assume they're laughing at me. I'll be coming home on the bus and feel like people around me are judging my appearance. Certain things will cause me to break down and cry due to previous trauma. Yet no one fucking acknowledges it.   


Living with trauma is like going on a hike where you have a 30kg weight strapped to your back whereas everyone else has a 5kg weight strapped to their back with a head start. Life is significantly harder yet others don't see it.   


They'll oversimplify it. ""No one cares, just stop worrying"". When you go through years of bullying, you get conditioned that people in fact absolutely do care.  Yet I'm treated as if I'm the crazy one."
3n5g8x,depression,I drew a comic about my experience with depression.,"Hey all. A couple of years back I had some very long and intense bouts of depression that seemed to cripple me completely. A significant part of my experience was apathy; I knew somehow that I was in a lot of pain, but I couldn't feel anything most days. When I could, it was anger. I isolated myself from everyone and lost a lot of friends during that period.

I still have a very hard time with depression, although it's been more manageable nowadays. I transferred schools and got engaged to my favorite person in the world. I still feel like garbage a lot of the time but I have to stop thinking that I'm *actually* garbage. I'm trying.

Anyway, about a year ago I tried to illustrate some of my experience in a [comic](http://imgur.com/a/RF48C), and I just wanted to share it with you guys."
iewx3e,depression,Not suicidal but wouldn't be mad if I died,"As I grew older there were more negatives than positives and there were more unbearable than bearable days. 

So much so that I am not affirmatively suicidal but if I died through no action of my own, I would feel relieved. Life is tiring, plagued with problems. Hardly any ups and we are confirmed many downs. There's nothing much left to hold on to. 

Is this a problem or something a lot of us have in common?

Edit : I deleted all social media apps from my phone the day I posted this, So I am now logging in to many comments from people feeling the same way. I've not found a way to tackle this problem, I've just simply lost the will to live and there's no quick solution to finding meaning in a life.

kz4j2r,depression,"Bought a gun with my stimulus for suicide, posting some ramblings here because I feel alone. It's long and I apologise for the length","Don't know where to start. But currently I'm in airbnbs using what little savings I have, trying not to think about commiting suicide. I used my stimulus check to purchase a firearm just for the peace of mind of knowing I could do it whenever I was ready, and when I realized how calm that made me, I decided to post here to see if anyone could give me some advice

I live in the desert in Arizona but I grew up in California. I've always felt alone and suicidal since a child. I was raised by my grandparents as far back as I can remember after my mother left to AZ after my half brother was born, years later my half sister was born there. After my grandparents passed when I was 16 I had to move to AZ. I've learned growing up, I was around dangerous settings, and car accidents in infancy and I'm worried that also might be a factor in why my brain is wired this way, on top of the regular stuff.

My grandparents were absolutely loving and seemed to try their best to put me in a better environment. I never told them these feelings because I wanted to be a ""perfect"" ""son"" for them in exchange for what they did for me. My grandpa was an old school cowboy type, traditional conservative..but never once told me I had to be any certain way.

As you can probably tell, polar opposite here in AZ.I have no relationship with my birth father or an idea of what he even looks like (yes no photos) anyways I was told by my parents that my father went to jail for murdering his girlfriend in CA (but he's been out for a few years already? Somehow?) and my mother and step father are convinced I'm a murderous sociopath that's going to kill them all one day randomly.

My step father choked me, and my mother and him pretty much told me to go because I make them feel uneasy. (stepfather kept a loaded gun on him in case he had to shoot me, leading to my airbnb situation) Most days at home I kept to myself in my room, but in October I went back to California for 2 weeks when my depression was hitting it's peak to see if I had hope or needed closure or something. I went back to my hometown and didn't feel any pain, I was happy for once, I was with my girlfriend who I wanted to take to prom back in CA before I had to move, and it feels like ever since I left, my life was in limbo. 

I want to go back to live with her but I need to find a job there as well as a cheap apartment, and it's extremely difficult. However she told me she's been wanting to leave home and get someplace for herself as well, it's honestly the only reason I haven't done it yet but deep down I feel like this won't work out. I have this sense of abandonment so I default to isolating myself and suffer because since childhood I've told myself over and over ""no one really cares about you"" and it still carries with me and still ruins so many of my relationships

But what's really making me finally want to go through with it, is that I did gig work, so I've been getting stimulus and the PUA, so basically money to just sit around doing nothing. I was living at home with my mother so I saved all the money. I have the title to my car (2012 nothing crazy) no debt, no student loans, and a 700 credit score. I was always the chubby kid but since covid I've lost weight (like 60 pounds) smoking weed and drinking water, I can get girls, I lost my virginity, and I'm still absolutely depressed and suicidal. I even put off losing weight for so long because I was so scared if I got in shape and hooked up with  women, & wasn't immediately happy. No Im actually feeling worse because now what? I know self care love is important and a good way to fight depression, but I lost that weight, paid off my car, reduced my debts, etc. The next goal would be to have my own home but that's just adding time to the clock like I did with my weight problem

All of this makes me terrified that what my mother and step father say is true and I should just isolate myself or die. I have NO family, when I was living with my grandparents until 16 no one ever came to visit or help, and at their funeral there was mostly friends from the neighborhood. I don't know aunties cousins uncles or any of that. That abandonment feeling was heightened because of this, because my grandparents, to me, my real parents, were abandoned by everyone when they were sick and dying. It reinforced the idea that this will happen to me too with any relationship/friendship I have. ""No one really cares"" 

I feel like no matter what life will not get better and I won't be happy, just on autopilot bouncing between feelings of absolute torment and apathy. I don't want to live for decades this way and I'd much rather die at peace. Not to mention how in my lifetime I'd be contributing so much pollution and waste to the world for an existence that isn't even appreciative of being alive. One other thing is holding me back is that I'm perfectly healthy and wish I could give all my organs away, I know they have to be on ice but I was planning on shooting myself deep in the mountains at sunset to let my body be given back to nature, but my kidneys could help save a child's life so it feels like a waste and insult 

I'm also very scared of dying and there being a hell and eternal punishment, I was never really religious but my grandma tried to raise me catholic and that fear is still always there. With age my thoughts of suicide went from ""I hate myself and want to die"" to ""I feel nothing and things would be easier for me and them if I was never born"". I don't keep ammo with me because now, I feel like that peaceful mountain death is the only thing keeping me going and as soon I get some ammo Im going on that drive"
e1nyjf,depression,A friend told my teacher that I want to kill myself. Now I'm in an even bigger mess,"So that happened... I had a really bad day and told my friend that I basically have no reason to live and that I want to kill myself. She told another friend, and she said it to my teacher. 

The teacher immediately called my parents. Now they're mad at me for everything. My friends are mad at me. My teacher is mad at me. Everything has gone to shit...

I just cannot say what I'm thinking, because it always hurts someone. I won't be able to hold it in for long. Guess this might be my last week on this world. I hope that without me everyone will finally be able to get some rest"

f8q6pt,depression,I tried to hang myself yesterday and they're talking about getting me into school in two days. F 13,"I am depression. The person I used to be is gone, there is no going back from this.
I'm just sat In the hospital while my mum speaks to cahms, trying to hide my neck from all the other patients. I'm desperate to leave the hospital and get home but I know I'm gonna try again eventually.

I've been on fluoxetine (prozac) for three months and everything is still getting worse. 

I just wish so much that the knot held, life just isnt for some people."
ehg01s,depression,I had a friend over for the first time in two years today,"She literally left five minutes ago, I don't know why but I feel happy, I feel proud of myself. A few weeks ago I was so crippled by social anxiety that I couldn't even bear to try and text anyone but now, I worked up the courage to ask an old friend to hang out and she said yes. She got to my house at 2 pm and left at 9:30 pm, that's like 7 whole hours!  I can't believe I did it. I had fun and she said she had fun too. She even hugged me when she left, nobody's hugged me other than my parents in two years. My mom cried because she was proud of me and I feel like crying too. We talked about the usual stuff (school, boys, makeup, memes, etc.) and for one of the first times, I felt like a normal teenage girl doing something that normal teenage girls do. 

For today, I wasn't the girl that was locked in the psych ward for a while, I wasn't the girl who lost everything when I was 13, I wasn't the freak who never talks at school, I was me. I just acted like myself and it worked? I feel a mixture of happiness and sadness right now, happy that I did it, sad that it's over. Where do I go from here? I have a friend now, that's good right? 

I feel a little bit proud of myself, is that weird? I just kinda feel good that I did it. I know that this post will get lost in this sub and probably nobody will see it but I just want somebody to know what I did today. I feel at peace. I just got a new fantasy romance book (my favorite kind of book) from the library, I have my comfort plush next to me for support (along with bulbasaur and pikachu plushies i got for christmas 😀) and I feel *peaceful* for once. I think i'm going to read my new book now, I feel like maybe I deserve it. Maybe I really do..

EDIT: wow haha, this kinda blew up overnight! Just saw this now as i've been spending almost all of today reading that book, I can't put it down! only a few more chapters left to go lol. I'm not really sure how awards work on reddit, but I know you're supposed to say ""thanks for the gold, kind stranger"" so thanks for the gold, kind stranger! I'll do my best to respond to all of these comments, you guys are the best, and seeing all of your kind words really warms my heart so much <3


POINTLESS EDIT #2: woah, I've cried because of some of your comments! (don't worry, all happy tears) it means a lot. As for the book goes, I loved it and just finished it a few minutes ago, i'm going to the library in a few more minutes to get the second one, it's called ""Caraval"" for those who care. I guess this has a meaning because when I feel especially depressed, I want to get swept away into a fantasy world just like that book does, I really recommend it, it uplifted me (no this isn't an ad for the book i just really love reading)"

jm9w19,depression,I will never understand how people can live and be happy,"Life is just objectively bad. Everything seems to be literally designed to bring you down. Even our own bodies are designed to keep us from being content. Think about drugs that make you feel good, eventually your body will reach a point where it needs more and more to reach the same effect. Until you overdose and die. You try to set up goals, you complete them and keep seeking more. You get money, you want more. People say practice graditude, for what? Why should I live a life where I constantly need to remind myself of trivial good things when everything is basically objectively bad? Your loved ones eventually die. You die. People kill each other on a daily basis. Do horrible things to each other. You work until you die. When you are young you have energy and time but no money. When you are an adult you have money and energy but no time. When you are old if you are lucky you have money and time but no energy and most likely riddled with sickness and lost most of your loved ones. Life is always out of balance to kick you down. The only way you can possibly live a nice life is if you are so rich you can just do whatever you want without working and help the ones you love to do the same. What are the odds of that? Almost zero. I'm just tired of it all. I wish I never existed, because life is simply not worth living and I don't think anyone will ever change my mind. No one has been able to help me. No meds, psychiatrist, psychologist, life habit, nothing."

h189bq,depression,Isn’t it weird to explain that you’d rather feel sadness than nothing at all ?,"It’s so weird that feeling nothing is the new normal for many , I used to think people were being super dramatic but that is really what it feels like . I think when I feel “ better “ , it’s not really like happiness , it’s more so that empty feeling that could pass for happiness / normality . I keep trying to force tears just to feel something ( as dramatic as it sounds ) , but nothing happens, I can never cry naturally , I have to force myself , and the minute I stop focusing on it , the tears dry up oops  . I feel isolated from everyone - like I can see my family / friends interacting but there’s like this chain keeping me rooted in place if that makes sense ? All communication is too much effort ? Let alone movement . The feeling of nothingness is almost safer and more comfortable and reliable ? I kinda prefer it than being happy I guess . Happy makes me feel vulnerable or uncomfortable . Everything good and bad in life comes from feelings ."

lq6oee,depression,Called the suicide prevention hotline for the first time ever,"I actually felt suicidal today. Really and truly.

I haven’t told anyone I know and don’t think I will.

I’ve found that being vulnerable with some of the people who I’m supposed to be closest with only gives them more ammunition to hurt me.

And the ones I do trust, well I don’t want to feel like a burden on them.

But, it helped so much. Honestly.

Maybe it’s kind of fake cuz it’s their job and they’re trained to be empathetic and understanding, but it felt SO GOOD to have someone to listen and care.

To give a fucking shit that I am dying inside and so goddamn overwhelmed with almost all the aspects of my life.

I cried so so much. I hid in the closet of my bedroom for some privacy and just poured my all my pain and worries out to the kind lady on the phone.

She comforted me and showed me kindness and concern and that felt so fucking good to just have someone listen.

She said she’ll call in again to check in on me and that feels nice.

Please use the suicide prevention hotline. I was teetering on the edge.

Probably wasn’t going to go through with it, but I really genuinely wanted to be dead because life had just dealt me one too many blows and I couldn’t stand up anymore.

Thank you stranger. Now I’m gonna go binge movies and work."
jaf1im,depression,“JuSt Go tO ThErApY”,"I see this here and other subs a lot. People vent about how shitty their lives are going or how they’re feeling (honestly; is anyone having a good time right now?). And the answers are usually: go to therapy. On the one hand, yea therapy is good for mental health shit. But it’s not that easy to actually get in. Especially in my country.

It took me a *year* to find a therapist that wasn’t booked and was open before 9 and after 5. Which was a non starter because lo and behold offices and jobs tend to want you working for them between 9am-5pm so you can’t go gallivanting off to talk to your therapist for an hour. Finally found one and come to find out my insurance won’t cover them. Going to this therapist costs me $99 a week. That’s more than I spend on groceries. I make a decent amount and haven’t yet been sacked because of covid but not many are as lucky as I.

/rant

Tldr: therapy isn’t easy to get into and isn’t cheap. “Go to therapy” is not a solution many people can take."
i6o9s1,depression,I feel like I can’t connect with people anymore.,"I spent so much time on my own, scared to trust people and just doing my thing. Whenever I hang out with people, I get sick of socializing super quickly like a shitty battery running out. I go on dates with guys who are very into me but I’m never into them. I never know what to say. I would rather stare at a wall for an hour than try to carry a convo with a stranger. Then I feel shitty about myself for letting them down. It’s not like I’d make a decent girlfriend anyway. 

Feels like I’ll never meet someone I will like spending time with. I just wanna go home and do stuff alone. I always thought I didn’t have friends cause I hate myself but I think I hate other people even more.


Edit: wow this blew up. I never expected that so many people felt the same. I feel a little bit less alone now. I also feel sad for all of you knowing we’re all going through the same pain <3"
fnkceg,depression,I feel beyond suicidal,"Anybody else have this? Suicide just feels completely pointless. Infact, everything does. People try to cheer you up and all they do is tell you to ""be practical"" and to ""stop being dramatic"" when you're not even showing any emotion the first place and all you're doing is lying there like a dead fish. Killing yourself is just another desperate solution to something that can't be fixed and even then suicide doesn't do anything except cause more pain to people. Not even dying seems appealing anymore. At this point I just want to lie in bed and sleep. And keep sleeping. And keep sleeping. But I can't even be afforded the option of giving up. If I do, people tell me I'm selfish and stick pitchforks in me. I ask why and the best answer I get for ""keeping going"" is just ""because you have to."" and then people get angry when you press them further because they can't really think of a reason either. It's just a blind desperation to survive we all have, like we're just that important. That need to survive other people have seems to have disappeared from me, and so has the need to die. I'm stuck here in this place and all I want to do is block it all out. Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed to piss. We keep going because we have to. But nobody ever tells me why.

Edit: Wow 1.3k upvotes and an award? This is the first post I've ever made here on this sub and you've all made me feel really welcome so thank you very much. I'm glad so many people get it. I knew I wasn't the only one out there who felt like this but to see the amount of traction this got and just how many people understood this makes me feel so much less alone. I wish I could thank each one of you individually! Thanks for being there Reddit. <3"

Well i have this teddybear which is a lil bit taller than me and i pretend that he is my imaginary friend (called thao btw... i dunno why) so i watch YouTube videos with him,  talk to him when i'm sad/suicidal and so on . Whenever i'm in school, downtown ... whenerver i'm not at home HE is still there and before this corona shit i slept smiling randomly when i had a conversation with him (in my head of course) and those looks (omfg the looks) other people gave me were something else. I havent even told this my close online friends nor my psychiartists because i'm so scared that they will laugh at me. 

I cant even blame anyone for laughing at me because wtf i'm 16 and while others go to the mall with their friend group i either get panic attacks or ho there with a person that only exists in my head.



Besides thao i take videogame charaters as my friends i really really like and kinda adore lol... am i the only one ?"

bkn0zs,depression,"I did it guys! Not a big deal in the grand scheme of things, but I cleaned my house!","I'm clinically depressed, and have been on Wellbutrin for about 4 months now. It certainly evened me out a bit as I'm not as mopey, but when I get home I don't want to do anything but either sleep, or play video games. 

Now I'm not looking for any praise because this is something that every adult should do, but I've literally been stuck as too lazy to even take the trash out to the curb except for like once a month. By no means was it a neckbeard den, but it was pretty gross.

I swept, mopped, folded all of my and the wife's laundry, and finally took down the Christmas tree (I know it's May...) amongst other stuff. I'm going to go do some yard work now!

I'm sorry, I really didn't know where else to share because my family thinks I have it together as they never visit, and it would sound ridiculous if I told them how proud I was of something that should be a weekly routine.

I actually feel like I can invite someone over for game night or something, as a lot of my coworkers find it weird that I never want to do anything at my house.

E: wow, I did not anticipate the overwhelming support. thanks gals/guys for letting me know that I'm not alone. Also, obligatory thanks for the gold kind Sir/Ma'am

I haven't been taking my medication lately, not sure why I just haven't, I know it helps and I know one reason I've been feeling bad is because I haven't been. I just need to make more of an effort to help myself and keep moving from the person I was back in February 2014."

hp11z8,depression,phrases im tired of hearing,"""it gets better"" 

for fleeting moments at best

""you are loved""

by who lmao? you, who doesn't even know my name? a stalker? 

""temporary problem""

well i guess this is techinally correct. no one lives forever

""theres so much to live for""

well maybe for you thats true, but for me who has  lost almost all motivation and ability to feel happiness its not relatable 

""what about your loved ones!""

okay thats just guilt trippy, and either way not everyone has loved ones/support systems just because you do janet 

""just exercise and drink water""

omg...thanks 🤩 /s

""what if something amazing and life changing happens that wouldn't if you died?""

yeah ive been carrying on that hope for years and here i am 

""just put yourself out there""

ive tried, so many times. part of the issue in the first place is that it usually never goes anywhere, and because of my mental health and abandonment issues people are usually driven away. also i completely lack the ability to maintain long term relationships, and have no idea what a healthy one is like in the first place. of course thats all assuming i cant get myself out of bed in the first place, find the social skills i dont have, and stop being an anxious little bitch. 

""god-""

shut up. i respect your religion but please shut the fuck up. 

""choose to be happy""

my ability to choose seems to be locked. should i put it in rice, turn it off and on?

""go to therapy""

sure, you paying?


seriously, i understand (and am thankful for even if it doesnt seem it) the sentiment behind some of these but they're basically all built on assumptions or plain old ignorance. also sorry if this type of post is overdone i needed to rant"
enfyh1,depression,Why does depression and anxiety make it so fucking hard to tell if people actually like you?,Seriously- I can’t tell even if I’ve known them forever. Do they like me? Or are they just too nice to tell me how much they don’t. Today is a bad day and I’m just obsessing over everything.
co91bi,depression,Does anyone else just think “kill yourself” every time you do something wrong?,I make a lot of mistakes and am very awkward so I end up thinking the words “kill yourself” dozens of times a day. It’s like a reflex at this point. I’m not actually going to kill myself but it’s like some subconscious desire bubbling up from deep down. I’m afraid I’ll start saying it out loud or something
g3df9g,depression,"I wish to be dead, not to die.","This statement makes no sense to someone who doesn't suffer from depression. I wish I was never born. I wish that this would all end. But I can't bring my self to end it. I want to not exist, but for some reason dying scares me. Not death whatever lies beyond I will deal with when I get there, but it's the step between suffering and non existence that scares me."
fekv9y,depression,"You ever get asked the ""where do you see yourself in five years?"" question in a job interview or something and have to stutter because ""probably not alive"" is the knee-jerk response?","First off, what a stupid fucking question to ask anyway.  What do you want to hear as the interviewer when you ask that question?  That I'm indifferent and stagnant enough to stay with your company that long assuming you hire me or that I'm ambitiously arrogant enough to in five years plan on being well passed this shit?  Fuckin' hell, man.

Undoubtedly there are varying degrees of suicidality just as there are reasons for doing it, all depends on the person.  I suppose I'm the sloth suicidal.  I've tip-toed through and around depression for the better part of my conscious life and I can't help but feel miserable an overwhelming percentage of the time.  Yet, when the obvious solution to this conundrum of despising being alive is ""well, don't be alive anymore"", the meddling safeguards of thinking about the wake of my actions swelling over everything and everyone I leave behind effectively whiteout any sort of blueprint I have for seeing myself out of my life.  Sounds rather counter-intuitive, but I'd rather my last thoughts be more ""you gave it a go, you're not doing anything wrong, you do you, kiddo"" and less ""hey, you're a tremendous asshole for this, I hope you know that.""

I can comfortably say I'm not doing it tonight, or tomorrow, or this year or even the next, but I genuinely feel like that's how I'm going out pending the absence of a freak car crash or lightning strike or some shit.

Don't even really know what I'm trying to say here, but do you ever feel like this?  Like life is essentially an existential clusterfuck that you want no part of, but for whatever fucking reason just can't make any sort of move?

Afterthought:  can't help but laugh that when driveling on in this post I look up at the browser tab and it says 'Submit to depression'  

 Haha, fuckin' A."

My life is so meaningless I feel as if it isint going anywhere and I just feel so empty inside. I use to enjoy activities I use to be around everyone and be happy now whatever I do I can’t enjoy .

d86ioa,depression,I really miss feeling joy and euphoria,"I wish I still felt that full-body joy/euphoria like I did as a kid. Waking up on Christmas morning, making eye contact with a boy I had a crush on during class, playing video games with my dad and winning the level. Everything feels so dulled and flat now, it makes me wonder what the point is. I’m spending money to go on holiday to beautiful places and barely enjoying it. The closest I get to joy is when I’m shitfaced drunk. 

Antidepressants sorta help but I don’t want to be taking them forever, plus the side effects are crappy. I guess I will have to settle for experiencing that childlike wonder and joy through my son, watching him do things for the first time.

Edit: please stop suggesting drugs"

I try to go out and have fun and meet new people but I never even have fun or I rather just be at home doing nothing.

k67uzs,depression,I think my life is destined to end in suicide,"My depression never goes away even though I've cycled through different therapists and medication for 7+ years now. Everything is much worse than before. The slightest inconvience makes me think of ending it all. I've tried 3 times and obs failed :D. I'm only 20 and I feel like an old man who has seen it all. I have had insomnia since I was a child. I can't sleep for days sometimes. It is fucked. And when I do sleep I sleep like 18 hours and still feel tired. It is very hard to keep up with my studies with this. Oh and I'm not in college but still trying to finish high school. It's not going well. I have no job and right now have about 50 bucks to live until january, after I payed my bills. I have no friends, strained relationship with family (basically just my mom, only child, father left when I was a baby) no one to talk to. No one cares about me. It's been like this all my life. Never had a single good relationship with anyone.

This all sucks but is not the why I think I will kill myself . I KNOW all of the things I could make my life go better but I just don't see it ever happening since my mental state never gets better. I've already experienced one psychotic episode. I feel constantly on the edge of sanity. I simply can't live like this much longer. There is no help for me i've tried the ""help"" so many times already. I think I will not make it to my next birthday. But that's alright, it will be a good thing for the world. I already have violent fantasies of just going to a mall and shooting people. It's best to end it before I harm somebody else. I'm not a good person and I wont be missed.


Edit: Honestly wow. I wrote this on like half brainpower before going to sleep just getting those thoughts that have plagued me recently out. I didn't think it would get this kind of response, it was a nice suprise to wake up to since I really didn't believe there was anyone that cared anymore. I especially didn't know that so many could relate to these kinds of thoughts. This is the dark side of depression that people don't want to talk about. All I can say is that I'm still here for now fighting on another day."

iarsbg,depression,I feel like a suicide attempt is the only way to make people care.,"I live in a country where depression isn’t taken too seriously. People just think I’m “going through a hard time” or “feeling down.” They don’t understand just how serious the circumstances are. Just to clarify, I don’t want to commit suicide (though I have seriously considered it). However, I do think that if I made a suicide attempt, then people’s perspectives would change. I know it’s an irrational way of thinking, but I’m getting to a point where I’m running out of options.

**Edit:  I should have worded that last sentence better.  We're not saying that all religion is ""notorious"" or anything.  We're saying that *this particular person* is being deceptive and manipulative, and misrepresenting themselves and their intentions in a way that's representative of the worst types of cultish ""religion"".  So our issue is fundamentally not with religion, but the misuse of it.**"
b6mv0t,depression,"Makes friends -> get close, really get to know them -> alienate them slowly with your issues -> get abandoned yet again several years into another good friendship that you hoped would last a lifetime -> repeat","This pattern has been repeating for over a decade for me. I don't still have any friends from then now. Hell, I barely have any friends left from 5 years ago.

I'm just so sick of it. I thought I'd broken this cycle, but it's rearing it's head again. I'm being told to just make new friends, but what happens a couple of years from now when they get sick of me too and I'm right back here, wallowing in my own feelings of abandonment, isolation, not belonging, etc. all over again?

It just reinforces for me that I don't belong on this planet, that as soon as somebody knows the real me, our relationship (whatever it's nature) is on borrowed time. That I'm just going to be flitting like a pariah between groups I never quite seem to fit into, spending the rest of my life pursuing validation wherever the search takes me next, until finally, almost mercifully, it ends. Just...why bother? If nobody can love me for the real me, and I can't for the life of me mould myself into a shape they can accept, what's the point?

Edit: thanks for the silver guys, I wasn't expecting this to be so well received."

I'll have hope for my future, think of a reason why it won't work out, and go back to being hopeless.

I'll reach out to someone on reddit and then realize what's the point of telling my life story all over again to some stranger and then go back to bottling up my despair.

keucdv,depression,I’m so embarrassed I can’t envision a future for myself that’s it’s affecting my relationships,"I’m envious of everyone around me. Even envious of the old me. I used to have goals and aspirations. Now all I do is sleep. I used to be smart, bright, had so much to say about the world and would easily slip into witty banter with my friends. Now I’m slow, everything I say feels scripted, every movement I make feels stiff, everything I do feels fake. I feel like an imposter. I got accepted to great colleges, attended one and ended up flunking three semester due to this void inside me. I was so embarrassed of the shell of a human I had become, hollow, purposeless, no goals, just empty. Even though I’m seemingly “much better” I’m still the same. Even when things are good, this void never leaves. When it gets quiet inside me, that void grows. I don’t know if I can continue living like this. I just want to feel normal. I’m talking to this guy I really like but he’s so motivated with such a bright future ahead of him, and he likely thinks the same of me based on what I told him, but those things I said aren’t me at all. I don’t know what I’m doing with my life. I’m constantly questioning how I’m going to survive if everything keeps getting heavier and I keep getting tired and nothing has meaning anymore. I want to smile genuinely. I want to feel that spark of interest. Nothing. I don’t see anything and I’m jealous of my brother and my cousin. They used to be the delinquents who got subpar grades and I was the golden child. Now the roles are reversed and I feel like they’re constantly looking down on me. I’m so ashamed I can’t keep living like this."

i0nm3y,depression,Boyfriend finally succeeded in taking his life Sunday,"My boyfriend of 6 years suffered from extreme depression, anxiety, and OCD. I constantly would lurk on this subreddit looking for insight, hope, understanding...

He begged for death. He finally did it the day before his birthday. He left two teenage girls behind. They're devastated but their dad had pushed them out as far from him as possible months ago during this last episode of depression and anxiety. He was so afraid of them, he couldn't even speak to them on the phone. 

He sought out all types of help-- therapy, behavioral therapy, ketamine infusions, he got sober, exercised daily... We did it all together. For a while it worked. We had about 2 years of what could be called happiness. He still had depressive episodes in the wintertime but they dissolved by the late spring and early summer. This past winter he was so afraid of how bad it was getting... it didn't lift in the early spring and then COVID hit. He had dental issues come up. All OCD triggers. 

He would say to me ""if only it one just ONE thing... JUST my teeth or JUST COVID... maybe I could get through. I don't want to die""

I had to leave for the past few months to help my sister who has two young children while her husband is away in the military. She was leaving the kids home alone (oldest just turned 12) to go food shopping due to COVID. I was also offered an internship until October that I had spent the past year trying to get. I told him I would be back.

He wanted me to leave and stay at the same time. He had tried suicide several times before I left and my soul hurt so bad. Every time I looked at him it felt like I was looking at a ghost. We had him committed to a 10 day treatment facility but it didn't work. I knew there was a chance when I left that I would not see him again. He often told me he knew he was breaking my heart and soul and hated me around sometimes because he wasn't the person he used to be. We talked every single night while I was gone.  I told him since I was away it was okay to talk to me about anything because I could still get a break and had the energy to listen. I did not talk to him the past couple nights leading up to his death. I was with friends and family. I told him I would call him Sunday. He never answered

He was suffering so much. I hope that he is in a better place. Anywhere would be better than here. I just wish I picked up the phone the last night he called. I wish I picked up the phone for the very last time and I could have said I love you. This has been the worst year of my life.

The thought that keeps running through my mind is “if someone who dedicated his life to mental health and had so many resources couldn’t get better, what hope do I have?” And also, selfishly, “how could he?”  I know mental health is a beast and I know from his brief mentioning that he was fighting demons, but it feels so unfair.

a46ol5,depression,My girlfriend died,"Hey Everybody.

I’m writing this to vent. 

About 5 years ago my girlfriend died. She died on the night of June 13, 2013 from a car accident. There was a drunk driver swaying back and forth in the road. She swerved to miss him and crashed into a tree in a ditch.

We met each other when we were 10 going on 11 years old back in 5th grade. Of course, for a while we were just close friends, but eventually it turned into more. We met each other randomly I would say. We just happened to be in the same class. From 5th to 7th grade, we hung out all the time (mainly during school). After 7th grade she moved a little ways away and started attending another school. We still hung out with each other every weekend though. I would say it was around this time we started actually dating each other. 

Fast forward to senior year of high school. At this point we had been dating for some time. Both of us applied to the same university so that we could go together after graduating. We wanted to go for film/ photography. We loved each other very much. We were honestly just right for each other. We rarely ever argued with each other or got annoyed with each other. 
We graduated from high school in May. Unfortunately, right after high school she had to move about a state away for family reasons, but then she was gonna be back soon for college. Senior year and after graduating we hung out quite a bit. When she left we would txt throughout the day and talk on the phone at night. 
On the night before June 13th we talked on the phone about random stuff for a good hour. She really hated living far away from me – especially right after graduating. On the 13th we didn’t txt each other all day because we were busy. Later in the day I waited until she was free so that we could talk on the phone. I txted her around 7 but she didn’t respond. I just assumed she was busy. A little after 8 I received a phone call from her mom. I was somewhat surprised she was calling me because although sometimes she would call it just seemed odd. I cannot forget or even describe the pain in her voice. It must’ve took her a few minutes to tell me what was even going on. Eventually she told me that my girlfriend had died. I remember initially freezing up, but I could feel tears running down my face. The pain, anxiety and guilt was massive. 

That night I could not sleep at all. The next night I slept maybe a few hours. My life took a sharp turn when she died. I was so much more lively and joyful – I just became dull and lifeless. I felt lifeless as well. This is kinda random, but I never grew my hair out growing up. It was always buzzed short, but when she died I kinda gave up and grew it out for 2 years. My life spiraled out of control for about two years. I became a nihilist. I lost joy in life.
I don’t wanna go down that rabbit hole though.

Fast forward to now. I’ve really came a long ways since then. I didn’t go to college right after high school. I couldn’t find the motivation to. After about two years I got myself together and attended college though. Right now in my life I’m almost about to graduate from college. Not in film/ photography, but I think she would be proud of me.

I wanted to write this because most people in my life have no idea that I lost someone so important. Losing her was like losing half of my being. 

Lately I’ve been thinking of her – wishing she was by my side as I graduate. I wish she was here.   
It feels good to write this though. 

For about three years I had no desire in pursuing another girlfriend, but lately I’ve felt the desire to do so. I hope someday I find someone I can love as much as I loved her.

Thanks for reading.

I'd never kill myself because the people that do care about me would be hurt and I care about them way too much to hurt them, so instead I'm just floating through life, barely surviving, with no retirement, I'll probably die while still working as an old man.

I'm a pitiful 35 year old man and I just wanted to let everyone know. I don't have any reason to move forward and even if I did, I'd never follow through with it anyway.

&#x200B;

Despite all the years of meds and therapy and crisis counseling and being told ""things will get better, you're a beautiful strong woman and everything will turn out wonderfully if you just have patience""-I can say that, with less than six months until I turn 40, I feel no less depressed than the day I was hospitalized, at age 12, for trying to kill myself via starvation. I can say honestly that at that point, I had absolutely no trauma in my life. My parents did nothing but love and care for me. I just so happen to have a ""depressed"" brain...and the beginning of puberty allowed its awakening.

I was able to make it through high school because I went to a charter school specifically for kids with ""emotional disturbances"", but I only made it halfway through college before I had another full-fledged episode of depression and had to drop out (I was walking out of classes because I needed to cry for no reason).  I still lived at home, and about a year later my parents told me I need to work. The only job I could do, one that allowed me to come and go as I please, and take time off when I needed it, and still be able to support myself, was stripping. In the meantime I was violently raped by a ""friend"" of mine. I couldnt't deal with it, so I just went to work the next day like nothing happened, with a tampon up my ass so I wouldnt bleed everywhere. Supressed it as long as I could, until again I woke up and decided I wanted to die. Began therapy a few years later...last I saw he was happily married with children. My fucking rapist got the life I wanted and never had.....

While I was able to move out on my own thanks to dancing, after 7 years I was vomiting before shifts, And my boyfriend at the time had told me that he would never marry me as long as I was dancing. So, I decided I was mentally well enough to try school again, and graduated one year later with my certification in personal training. I spent a few years making minimum wage to build my experience, and finally I got a full-time gig with benefits. All the while noticing that my boyfriend still didnt seem into marrying me, it had been 6 years-he finally told me ""we are not financially stable yet"". Even tho he made over $100,000 a year...but alright.

Turns out, he was cheating on me with a goddamn stripclub bartender! I googled his email because I had forgotten his Amazon name, and ended up finding a whole bunch of shit that devastated me. His reaction was to first say "" I didnt think you'd ever find that"" (well, use a different handle than the one you always use next time), then to tell me that I needed to move out. Told him I didnt have the money to move out. He said he would pay for the deposit, but when I found a place-he couldnt produce it. Finally told me he didnt want me to leave after all,, we can work on this, blah. Until six months later, when he finally admitted-after 8 years-that he didnt want to marry me, ever. I just wasnt a good enough ""homemaker"". I finally asked for help from my one rich aunt, got the deposit, finally moved out..

While in the meantime, I had been promoted to head PT and trainer for new staff; despite the heartbreak at home, I actually had a job with a prestigous title (for me) and an actual, successful career. I was making enough to pay rent, and was on track for another raise...

Until 2 weeks later. When I was fired over the phone, because one front desk worker said she ""heard"" me jerking off a client on an recumbent bike. Seriously. Never in one million years would I have ever even thought of doing such a thing, but you know...she was 18 and her boyfriend enjoyed his workouts with me. That was enough for her to make sure I never worked there again...I was never accused once of jerking someone off when I was a goddam STRIPPER............

Of course with no job and no income, I was given one month's notice to move out. I found a cheap room, and was able to get some work at an old colleague's new gym. I didnt have a lot of hope for the future, but I still had a little.......

And then, I got Covid and almost died from it.

It's been six months and I'm still too weak to walk let alone train, too much brain fog to really do any sort of work, and only have two weeks of unemployment (that I had to fight for) left. I have no money and no job. No man has ever decided I was worthy enough of marriage or having a family with. My own body has become a shell of itself, and the hypoxia from Covid as well as the inflammation in my brain from it, has made my depression 1000x worse. I tell people I need help, physically and mentally, but all I have to do is say Trump could have handled this better-and they basically tell me I should kill myself because saying mean things about Trump hurts their feelings. Or, they're just so ""tired"" of the minimal restrictions that they freely admit, they just don't care about me or my health anymore. Because you know, people need indoor dining but they don't need me....

These are people who claim to love me, saying these things. This is my support system saying these things to me........

Can anyone here honestly say, if they were me, they would still have hope that ""things will get better""? I'm not doing another 40 years of this. And since Covid didn't kill me (though it came so close I was on oxygen for 6 days)-I'm nearing the point where I just have to do it myself.

Thanks for reading."
96cyx2,depression,Is anyone else afraid of opening up about their depression because it sounds needy or desperate?,"I try to keep my mental health issues to myself. I don't want to tell others because I feel like an attention whore, and I've been accused of that before. What about you?"
d4d08a,depression,I miss the old me,"I’ve forgotten what genuine and pure happiness actually feels like. I’ve forgotten what it’s like to actually have a passion for life. These last few months have been a blur, I can only really recall a few days in detail. I miss the old me, she had so much potential. She had so many friends, she could actually read a book without being overwhelmed, she looked healthy  and prettier. Now I can’t even move out of bed. I just lie there waiting for someone to text me, but it rarely happens now because either people hate me now or I’ve pushed them away. I don’t even have the energy to pull out my laptop and watch Netflix now. My housemates don’t even notice when I don’t leave my room for a week. Even my mother said this depression is making her life a misery. I used to be so full of life, but that seems like an eternity away, such a distant memory now. It feels like I have no one now and I have no energy to even move, let alone do anything slightly productive. Every single thing overwhelms me-the cat wouldn’t eat the food I gave him today because he’s so fussy and I just burst into tears. I’m so tired. I want out. Everything used to be so different.

EDIT: I never expected this post to blow up so much and I’m overwhelmed by the response rate and kind messages. I’m a bit too overwhelmed to reply just yet, but I will soon, know I’m appreciative of every single pm and comment. Thank you for making me feel less alone, this website is very special"
l3y52m,depression,I think acting depressed around people was a mistake,"No one gives a shit lmao. Unless you have a very special person who's very close to you, whoever notices you're acting off will not want to help, because you're not fun to be around, and in the end you'll just lose connections.

Truth is, you're way better off if you force a smile on your face. If I had known this before, I feel like I might have had more and better relations with people that I would have liked.

Don't get me wrong, I think its important for people to talk about their depression and be true to themselves. But it's just simply futile to mope around depressed around your peers since that's just gonna insure that no one's ever gonna talk to you, its a terrible alternative. So ""give in"" if you want to help yourself.

EDIT: okay, I was wrong. I really should not have gotten this many upvotes. I know no one is gonna see this since I'm editing after like a month, but I was wrong. 

Talking to people helps so, so much. Its just, you gotta find the right people, or you gotta build a friendship with someone to eventually be able to talk about your depression. Its true that forcing a smile on your face will probably help you to build these kind of friendships, and its true its not a good idea express your depression to randoms just like that.

 But I just want to say, don't bottle up your feelings forever. Do what you must to create friendships with people that enable you to do this. Often forcing a smile helps for this. But dont do this forever."
cnp01x,depression,What does a person even do all day?,"I don't get it. I have so many things I could do right now - exercise, listen to music, watch a movie, anything - but I have no motivation. It's not that I want be lazy, no, it's that I have no inclination to do anything in particular and that I know I'll most likely feel disappointed if I DO force myself to do anything because it won't be fulfilling and all I'll be left with is a confirmed inability to enjoy things. I don't want to be sitting in my room alone doing nothing, but I'm too tired to be outside doing something. I'm just cycling between the same sites I check every couple minutes somehow expecting things to be different.

What does a person even do all day? I don't get it."
hjvmo8,depression,I don't know how much longer I can live like this,"I hate not having anyone to share my thoughts with. Someone to watch movies with. Someone I can go to when I feel down. Someone who cares about what I did yesterday.

Nothing matters when you've got no one to share your life with. It doesn't matter how pretty the sunset is, how exciting the movie is, how great the concert is, how tasty the food is if you don't have anyone to enjoy the moment with. A friend, a family member, a significant other, it doesn't matter. I just wish I had *someone* who really cared. I have family, I have friends, but they only make me feel more alone."

I find it hard just to wake up and do more than the bare minimum needed to survive. Anyone else wish they could just have the motivation to do things without thinking twice about it? For instance, I got promoted at work but it's so hard doing the homework needed for me to gain the knowledge to do this position. Other people in similar circumstances found it easy to just do the work but it's just a chore for me. And when I try to do it it's just brings so much psychological pain that it makes me feel physically ill so I go off and do leisurely things. Anyone have any tips to combat this?"
ktqu2r,depression,Six Years Ago Today I Tried to Kill Myself,"January 9, 2015 I tried to kill myself.  Today, I am in an even worse position than I was.  I'm now separated from my husband, caring for my son alone, a quarter of a million dollars in debt from school, living alone in a townhouse I can't afford, and having chronic health issues.  I don't want to die now, but God, I can't help but think how much better things would have been if I was successful 6 years ago.  My son wouldn't have to grow up in a broken home.  I wouldn't be crying every single day.  I wouldn't be trying to finish school when I can barely function.  My body wouldn't feel like it was shutting down.  There would be none of this suffering.  I guess what I'm saying is this living thing was only worth it because I got a child out of it.  I got to know the real love for my baby, and now I'll never ever kill myself because I have him and he will need me forever.  Which coincidentally means I have to suffer forever until I die naturally.  :( Sorry, just in my feelings today.  I want to celebrate my 6 more years of life, but I just can't.  There's nothing to celebrate about living a life like mine.  Maybe I don't think positively enough.

itvsvx,depression,2 years of trying to avoid accepting that I have depression and today I can’t stop crying because of one of the stupidest reasons. I am so tired.,"2 years of going through 2 breakups and multiple diagnoses of different diseases at a very early age and never did I feel any sadness or cried. I knew I was depressed and avoiding it. And today suddenly while getting out of car I dropped my key and it fell into a pothole and I can’t stop crying since then. 

Life has been shit and I’m so tired. I haven’t even read a book in months. I can’t study, can’t read, can’t even play video games with concentration anymore. I’m so tired and yet I have so many responsibilities.


Edit - Thank you to everyone who’s replying. I’m better now since the evening. I don’t know why but it was a sudden trigger. My car has been a way to just avoid any shitty situation. And losing the key was a very sudden trigger even though I knew I had another key. I get it’s a very weird thing to cry over but I just couldn’t stop. Thank you to all of you. The comments helped a lot.

Edit 2- Thank you everyone! I’m fine now. I guess the trigger was suddenly too much to handle. I’m gonna try to get help here. I don’t think I’ll avoid it anymore."
7dstps,depression,"The question I hate most: ""Are you okay?""","Because the answer is always ""no"" but if I say ""no,"" they always ask me whats wrong. If you can see through my happy facade I'm nowhere near capable of telling you what's wrong without breaking down. If I am somehow capable of telling you, you won't understand and you will forever look at me through different eyes. You will always see my answer to your question written on my face..."
504py2,depression,High functioning depression is so hard for people to understand,"People are only just starting to understand depression but it's usually depression that's making you stay in bed all the time or not eat... 


I always feel like people think I'm lazy or I even question whether I have depression, I exercise regularly, go to uni, eat well, cook a lot of fresh meals for myself, socialise and work... But I had to cut my hours because I had a breakdown. I find it hard to make it into uni, my attendance is awful. I'll flake on plans to socialise sometimes because of the lethargy and anxiety of leaving the house. I have days where I'm like a zombie, everything is boring to me and i have a hollow chest feeling all day, I feel heavy and I kind of feel like I'm trying to run through deep water.

But nobody really expects this from a depressed person, it seems like I get through life just fine because I do get through life but it's actually much harder than it seems.

Edit: didn't expect this to get the amount of attention it has. I'm reading every comment and I'm trying to reply to all of them. Thank you for responding, feels good to know this isn't as uncommon as I thought, hope other people find comfort in that too.

Edit 2: still reading every comment! Just wanted to share something that might be helpful. I downloaded an app called Moodnotes, cost about £3? You can log your mood each day (which is useful if you're trying to map your mood changes) and identify thinking traps etc. I'm not advertising or anything I don't even know if this is allowed but it has been massively helpful for me, it's nice to have a bit of balanced reflection each day."

fvwsmq,depression,"I spent my whole life walking on eggshells, trying not to offend, to please everyone. Now I feel like the most uninteresting person alive.","The worst part is that now I have this ingrained in my behaviour. If someone says something that I disagree with, I try to twist my views to agree with theirs. 

I'm so worried about seeming normal, that I take everything someone says seriously, which makes me look like an idiot when I inevitably take seriously every joke that gets thrown at me.

When I examine my past behaviour, all the jokes seem obvious and all the twisted opinions seem stupid, but I can't help it. The only thing that brings out my true self is alcohol, but I don't want to go down that road.

I just wish I could be as confident sober as I am when drunk (slightly drunk, I've never been so drunk I couldn't control my behaviour, or puked and couldn't stand up straight). Everything feels so natural, so relaxed, I feel like a man instead of a mouse."
8uj4ci,depression,"I never realized it, but I always used to try to make other people laugh and smile because I never wanted them to go through what I'm going through right now.","Funny how none of those people are making the same attempt for me.

Looking back on it, it's kind of funny. No one wants to be around a sad person, so you fake being happy to keep them in good spirits and not be alone. The charade works so well that no one would actually think you're suffering inside. A ridiculous catch-22, isn't it?

I was like a frowning clown with a smile painted on.

And now the years of caked on face paint has started to crack, revealing nothing but an empty expression underneath. Completely blank and hollow... It's as if my face has been wiped away. Withered to dust."

g2c8pv,depression,I hate that nobody can understand what trauma does to you,"And this compounds the depression.

Not only is childhood trauma (one in which your parents - who *should* have represented all that was good - were in fact, evil) one of the worst possible causes of depression - but the fact that nobody gives two shits other than telling you ""get over it,"" or ""seek help."" 

As if trauma is expected, but not ignoring it is not expected. You're supposed to conform to this place; to accept trauma as normal, if not something you *do*, normally.

And so you get even more depressed about the fact that nobody understands what it's like to be depressed."
br7w9r,depression,My friend killed himself,"He was 18. I grew up with him and he was like my little brother. He was gentle and sweet and loved animals and flowers and thrifted clothes. He was quiet and calm in a world that is loud and harsh. He killed himself.  He didn't let anyone see all the pain he was carrying every day. He was exhausted and he only saw one option and now I'm trying to pick up the pieces of myself. I am heartbroken and angry and devastated there is a crushing weight on my chest and I can't breathe. I feel too much while feeling too little.  I have struggled with depression and anxiety for years. But this. This is...overwhelming. It is excruciating. It is numbing. It is agonizing and yet it is impassive.  I feel everything and I feel nothing.   I don't want to die. But I don't know how to live.

I'm fighting every day. I'm pushing through for my family and friends who are also experiencing this loss and my cats who need me to feed them breakfast. Every day is a struggle right now. But I'm fighting. Keep fighting, friends."

knon6g,depression,Why do I crash so hard after having dare I say a good day,"This is why I dont trust feeling good anymore man.  Like, the better of a day I have at work and how good I feel (which is honestly rare), the worse off i am after it.  Today was fuckin chill.  I got shit done, I was moving, I was working good and as much as I'm scared to actually say it, it was a good day at work.  5 o'clock hits and the INSTANT I walk out that door, it all comes crashing down.  The 25 minute drive home was spent staring blankly ahead of me and I barely remembered the drive once I pulled in my driveway.  And once my ass hit the couch it was like fuckin game over.  I just plummet into this godawful mood like I want to fucking die and wished a semi had hit ice and flattened me earlier.  Intrusive, irrational, disgusting thoughts running buck-fuckin-wild with no control.  and the instant those are ""appeased"", all that energy turns into self-loathing.  I never spend time in my bedroom unless it's to sleep.  But I went to lay in bed and I just wanted to cry.  Me.  Who went 6 years without a single fucking tear and only cried earlier this year cause I got absolutely fucking shitfaced on alcohol and weed.  Laying in bed and wanting to cry for no reason, but not being able to because I built it into my system to suppress it and completely shut down emotionally any time there's a feeling like that.


this is why I'm scared to ever say ""yea I had a good day"".  the fall that immediately comes after is fucking soul-crushing.  every time.  what the fuck is wrong with me"
75t4uu,depression,Do you hate complaining to people because you feel it will make them hate you because you are telling them your problems?,
kwddjw,depression,Sometimes I wish I killed myself when I was 12,"I'm crying writing this so I'm sorry if something is incoherent.  I remember being sad when I 12 and thinking it was normal. 10 years later, nothing has really changed. I can recognize now how much I mean to some people now, which makes it even harder. It makes me wish I killed myself when I was more naive and selfish. I love the people surrounding me and they support me but I can't seem to be happy. I can't help but feel like everything that goes wrong around me is my fault and that there is no way to fix it. If anyone reads this, thank you for taking the time. I know reading things from this sub can feel like a lot.

loljh5,depression,lonely,It just really sucks to open social media and see all these friend groups being happy and lovely with eachother while my lonely ass is just over here being lonely
d4pn7l,depression,Sometimes when I pretend to be happy I actually think my mood gets better,"It's really weird. My friends in school have no idea about my depression and I like to keep it that way, so I always try my best to hide it and I smile and laugh and make jokes and sometimes, not very often, but still  my mood suddenly really gets a bit better but it will disappear immediately when I have a second to myself but it's just really weird. Maybe you can pretend so long that you can actually get happy. Sounds dumb but hey, trying to grasp every little straw here.

Edit: It's crazy reading how many people can relate. Thought I was being quite alone with that. Thanks for all of you sharing your thoughts. I guess at some point you are just so low down in that hole, that you seriously try anything to make it go away, even if it means, needing to force yourself through 3 hours fake laughing until for a moment you feel good, only for it to be taken away as soon as you have a moment alone to yourself and you would gladly collapse onto the floor and sleep for days"

7fmaku,depression,Always have this feeling of wanting to go home but i don’t know where home is,
ajcyb3,depression,Everyday I do literally nothing.,I lay in bed watching YouTube videos everyday. Sometimes I get up and watch YouTube videos at my desk. I have severe social anxiety and no friends. This is my life. 
l1hote,depression,I feel like I have to at least try to kill myself before anyone takes me seriously. (17f),"This is long and I feel like I’m attention seeking for even writing this, but it’s how I feel. I could never actually do anything, but I’m tired and don’t know what else to do.

Everyone in my life seems to think that just because they don’t see me crying 24/7, I’m not depressed. But when I do end up opening up and crying, they take it personally and blame themselves or me and make me feel so ungrateful that I feel horrible for even trying to express anything. In result, I usually try and suppress my emotions to keep from bothering anyone and especially prevent making my mom feel bad as she tries her best. 

Thankfully, somedays I’m numb and can’t feel anything at all. 

My mom who I love dearly, feels that because I don’t pay any bills and don’t go to work, there’s absolutely no reason why I should be depressed. Which makes sense I guess, but my brain apparently doesn’t agree lol. 

I zone out as an escape sometimes and end up in deeper trouble. I’m weeks behind on my schoolwork and have teachers calling me everyday, being patronizing and snippy about the missing work and I hate myself for it. I’m occupying valuable space in their class, and for what? I feel like I’ll never get caught up. I just want to be dead or at least in the hospital or something so that they’ll leave me alone, a thought that I’ll most likely never act on. Every time I look at my work, I get incredibly nervous and can’t think of anything else but failing and how angry they probably are with me. 

My mom is disappointed in me and no matter what I do or say, she doesn’t believe me and I end up giving up in the end because I feel like nothing. I look like a terrible student which is so different from my previous school years. I feel like I try so hard, but there’s no evidence to support it. I really wish I could do more, but I can’t, I try to force myself, but I can’t get much done and I don’t know why. I’m a terrible student, dumb, useless, and can’t complete work on time. I’ve had no motivation for my work or anything else (like washing my hair or getting out of bed) completely disgusting, I know. 

I also have no friends. Normally, people exaggerate and say they have “no friends,” but at least have one or two. I have none. No one to talk to or confide in. I’ve never fit in anywhere and have social anxiety. No one cares. No one’s ever cared.

I struggle completely alone and have for seven years. I’ve lost interest in everything I used to love, and it hurts so much. I think about killing myself almost everyday, but I’m a coward and would never do it. 

I’ve asked in the past about seeing a therapist (covid makes the process even harder), but felt so horrible even asking because my mom said ‘fine, but she’d have to pick up extra shifts to afford it’ and that she didn’t understand why I couldn’t just talk to her because we’re close instead of being ungrateful and wanting to rely on a stranger and meds to make me stable like someone with real issues. 

I know she was just frustrated, but it’s statements like those that make me wish depression was more common and visible like the flu or something, so that I wouldn’t have to explain or feel weird or bad about getting treatment. 

It won’t be until I finally do something actually harmful, physical, and visible (my current “self harm” which I don’t do often, isn’t) that I might get help. If I can even be helped. But I won’t and probably never will. 

I feel like nothing and a huge burden at the same time. A complete failure. And although I try to be as selfless as I can, I appear and feel like a selfish, ungrateful brat. I don’t have a bad life and my parents are great so why do I feel this way? There have been days where it felt like it could possibly get better, but I kid myself every time. Each year it somehow gets worst. I don’t really want to die, but hate my entire existence and want to get away. 

Also, I know this probably seems trivial and somewhat whiny. I’m sorry for bothering you all. I didn’t know where else to put this and it felt somewhat soothing to vent. Thank you if you decided to read this.


Edit: I’m typically a very private person so it took a lot to share this. Thank you all for being kind and giving me advice, I’m eternally grateful. I feel less alone now. It felt really nice to finally vent, I’m staying strong and am not going to let depression win. I thought about deleting this, but if it helps someone I’ll leave it up :)"

dt5r5o,depression,Anyone else's depression going into overdrive with the recent seasonal changes?,"I was doing great all summer. Wouldn't even say I was depressed just a few weeks ago. But with the clouds, coldness, late sunrises, and early sunsets, I can feel things starting to spiral. Particularly, I seem to have lost the ability to fall asleep at the right time or sleep through the night. My schedule is all shifted, and I'm basically just getting sleep in chunks at random times. My mood is reflecting my poor sleep.

I don't know if it's SAD or if the light changes are screwing with my circadian rhythm, but I don't like it.

I think depression for me tends to be a very physical affair. Body pain, muscle tension, sleep disturbances. It always seems like this stuff comes first. My mood issues are more insidious. I'm generally pretty rational and emotionally reserved, and don't tend to feel emotions super strongly in one way or another. So it sneaks up on me..a slow, creeping apathy and anhedonia. I tend to get pretty deep into it before I realize how bad things have gotten.

Think I'm going back on the Zoloft."

But I can't, and I don't know how to make it better. 40 years old, my youngest kids are starting to get to the point where they don't need me as much anymore which is good for them. I fear the day tho when I don't even have them to give me some purpose. Living out the rest of my days as a functional vegetable. Pretty sure that's where I'm headed.

kg9fpf,depression,My mom tried to choke me last night,"this is gonna be a long post cause i wanna vent a little.as you can imagine i(F19)have a fucked up family.my parents hate each other and they don't even talk to each other unless it's absolutely necessary but they ""stayed for the kids"" :).my dad has problems too but my mom is insane.she humiliated,hit,threatened me since i was a child and she is a control freak.i wasn't allowed to leave the house by myself until 2 years ago that i went to university and even then,she took the bus with me,watched me going to the building,and then took the bus back home! Whenever i went out between classes with my friends,i was scared that somehow she is following me.i am not even studying the major i wanted because she did'nt let me move to another city and uni.she is paranoid that i am in a relationship with someone and ask me who am i talking to whenever i look at my phone and she tells me that i am a whore and i will do anything so i need to be controlled and wants to know what i am doing 24/7.she tried  so hard to make me dependent on herself financially,etc.she didn't let me go to the classes i wanted.she constantly cuts off the internet and tell us (my dad,my brother and me)that we are ganging up on her!she does'nt even let us eat what we want and we have to stick to the diet she has! she is so problematic and toxic  that even her family want to cut us off and won't invite us anywhere anymore.EVERYTHING should be how she wants or she would make everyone's life a nightmare(as if it is'nt already).this is just a little portion of the things she has done and if i wanna tell everything i should write a 100 page diary.i honestly don't know what i did to her i was a quiet and hardworking kid and i have always had my head  in books and had great grades and did'nt do ANYTHING bad in my entire goddamn life! I feel so stupid that it took me so long to realise that these things does'nt happen in normal families and well chasing a child  with a knife and threatening to kill them is not normal:).and the fact that i live in the most fucked up country does'nt help at all. now thanks to covid the classes are online and  i haven't seen anyone except for my family for a whole year and i think i am finally going insane.i have depression and anxiety and lately it got so bad that i can't even get out of bed and i can barely function.last night after i finally managed to finish my assignment i decided to watch something funny to forget the yellings and fights in the evening.just as i grabbed my phone she burst in and told me that i am not allowed to stay up this late then she jumped towards me and started choking me.she has done this before so it was not a suprise but this time i couldnt breath at all and i was sure that i am going to die.and when she let go she started screaming and cursing at 3 fucking a.m and told us that she is going to kill us in our sleep. then she claimed that my dad has hit her and gave her a concussion or sth:))).she is now going to sue my dad:).i am just worried about my dad and brother and not myself because i am suicidal and the only reason that i have'nt killed myself already is because of my brother(27).we don't even talk that much but i feel a responsibility towards him.he is going through enough with a fulltime  job and can't even afford living on his own. i can't hurt him like this but i don't know how much longer can i stay alive and live this nightmare.i talked to my dad several times but he insist that we should live together like a ""family""(wtf).i am now hopeless and if you can't advice anthing please at least tell me a painless and affordable way to kill myself.

Edit:This might seem ridicolous but these comments,dms and support was the best thing that happened to me in a year. i am completely alone and i was so unstable that day so if it weren't for your kind messages i would have probably killed myself.i've read all of the comments and most people have  suggested things that i have already tried(i still appreciate it you guys are amazing).but something came to my mind, i found my uncle's number (by pure luck)who lives in france.i would call and ask for help cause i have no one else.he would'nt even recognize me cause my mom has cutt off my dad's side of family and i haven't talked to  them for years.if this does'nt work i don't know what to do anymore.i know that people won't probably see this again but i just wanna let you guys know that you all should be proud of yourselves cause  you all are amazing and kind people.thank you all so much."

ibn6rc,depression,My dad is gone... forever,"This is so hard for me to talk about so I’m just gonna start. Sorry for the run on sentence and the mistakes. 


My dad died last week, on Friday actually. I have been trying to be so strong but it is so hard and I know he would be upset I’m needing this help but honestly I just need any supportive words. He was with his best friend and they got a call for a big contract (my dad and his roomate are electricians, my dad is 63 and retired but still helps his roomate our) my dad left the shop to go to the bank to pull out some money. He was 10 steps from the cross walk but he thought he could make it jay walking accross a 4 lane highway. The light was red and there was a big semi truck blocking the 2 lanes after the meridian. He tried to walk in between the semi and it’s trailer and the light turned green. I know all of you can imagine what happened next. I feel so fucked and so sad my dad has a good 15-20 years in him, he was healthy and happy. A little skinny from beer and coffee but he wasn’t no lazy old man. I have 3 brothers (27 year old,24 year old, 19 year old (me), and my little brother is 16.)
I just had a kid and I’m already so stressed about that cuz it was a little unexpected. And last my dad knew was it was going shitty and we were getting ready to go to court. Me and the baby mama talked and decided we are probably gonna get back together we just need time but right now we are friends and I have been seeing her everyday since my son was born. I never even got a picture with my dad and my newly born son. Im also so worried about my mom because she gets like this over if she looses a pack of smokes. I don’t know how she is ever gonna be okay again. I don’t know if I’ll ever be okay. I just want to walk into my dads house hug him one more time laugh about anything. He always dropped whatever he was doing to help out family, no matter what. My mom and him were divorced for 20 years and when mental health kicked my moms butt and she couldn’t take care of my little brother and was about to go homeless my dad was there for her offering her his bed even after 20 years. I just keep rambling on because I really don’t even know how to end this I just don’t even know. I love you so much dad and I miss you. His favourite beer was Budweiser and I don’t drink beer so if anyone could pop a bud for my dad. Thank you. He also loved to fish. He was most happiest sitting on the lake with his boys fishing all day. I love my dad so much he was an asshole sometimes but that’s cuz he wanted what’s best for us and what dad isn’t an asshole sometimes. He never beat me or made me feel embarrassed he was always there. My youngest brother was even only my half brother but my dad called him his son, and my brother called him dad. I know my dad wasn’t a dumbass I fucking know that to the absolute top of anything. He just made a dumb idea. Must have been feeling 19 again. I love you so much dad. I’m gonna try everyday to be okay for you and to make sure mom will be okay. I’m gonna be the best dad just like you were to me. ❤️❤️❤️❤️"

i8b9ho,depression,Hate the idea of doing any work...,"Am I only one that feels this way? Along with all the symptoms of depression, the one that I find the least common is the lack of willingness and ability to do anything. 

I hate it when I know I have uni work, I hate it when I have to do with the family somewhere, I hate it when I have to iron clothes, I can’t study, I can never do my laundry in time, etc

It’s not coming from a standpoint of, “oh I preferrr not to do workkkk today”.

Just work in general is painful to me. It can ruin my day just hearing that I have any task to complete. 

Many depressed people are still having fun going to work, doing chores, etc. But it feels like death to me."

8wmeii,depression,My girlfriend died,"Hey everybody,

On monday my girlfriend of 2.25 years died in a motorcycle accident. She was only 18 years old.

I don't really know how to deal with the loss. I cannot speak to most of my friends. I cried a lot but now I just feel numb. I don't want to feel numb. I want to cry. I want to be sad.

I don't know how to handle it."
hvunye,depression,I have lost my empathy.,"Before my depression, there was warmth and curiosity in my personality. When people I cared about told me their stories I listened and felt happy for them. When I saw a family member struggling I would feel compassion for them and I would do what I could to help them. 


I seem to have lost this. When someone tells me about themselves or their experiences, I don't care unless it affects me. Their stories are boring to listen to, even the closest life events. Engagements, marriages, accidents, ilness, none of it interests me. I feel extremely guilty over this and it's a big part of my illness. When I speak to someone, I feel intense anxiety and a bit of fear. It feels like the person speaking to me will get upset because I'm not enthustiastic or engaged in the conversation - as if they'll think I don't enjoy spending time with them and thus stop spending time with me. I'm afraid of losing them and being alone.


It's true, though - I don't enjoy spending time with them, which is part of why I feel so horrible in the first place. 
  

I know that the problem is me, not them. My friends and family are fantastic people and we've been very close in the past but when I think about my memories with them I feel nothing. I have avoided them for about 5 years because of this. I'll come to family gatherings when it's unavoidable, like Christmas, but every time I'm asked to come visit someone (or someone asks me if they can visit) I make up excuses."

a6i9ww,depression,Anyone tired of pretending you’re fine because not being fine makes others uncomfortable?,I’m talking specifically about my immediate family here really. I’m sick of this “what’s wrong with you?” accusation. If you really want to know what’s wrong ask me to talk about it. Ask me if I’m okay. Ask me if there is anything you can do. Don’t just make the statement that you think I’m not doing well and then think that you’ve done your part in helping me. I’m sick of pretending to be fine because my not being fine makes you uncomfortable. I’m tired of feeling so guilty all the time because I’m not fine and my not being fine is so inconvenient for everyone else. Christmas coming up is so scary to me because I know they all want me to just be perfectly fine so that Christmas is great for everyone else but it’s going to be so suffocating for me to pretend and I’m absolutely terrified of it.

kqu0by,depression,A burden.,"No one wants to spend time with a negative person, no one makes time for someone who is having a hard time. No one wants to hear bad things, complains, issues that others are struggling with. None of this is fun, so no one truly cares, no one puts the effort into a relationship whether is a friendship or more.
Most people are selfish and that's ok. People don't own people. Everyone deals with things and that's ok.

So I'm giving up asking for help, I don't want to bother anyone anymore. I don't want to upset others, waste their time...
I'm just a nobody, a burden who doesn't deserve anything!

I'm not even sure why I'm writing this, probably because I've isolated myself completely and I guess, subconsciously I might appeal to this as a last attempt at admitting I desperately need help, I'm ignoring loved ones, messages from friends, everyone and I don't even understand why. All I know is that I had enough of feeling lonely, enough of this unbearable pain, enough of hurting myself because I can't take it anymore."
essxe0,depression,It’s not fair.,"I fucking hate it so much. People around me, just go through everything with so much energy and power and they’re still so happy and never exhausted.

I can’t remember the last time I was actually happy. I hate drinking because it makes me so fucking sad, but I love it because I can accept my sadness completely.

I don’t want to be lonely but I just want everyone to leave me alone so I can find the strength to kill myself. I hate it. I really hate it. It’s not fair, and fuck it. No one understands it, everyone asks me to open up and when I do they don’t know what to say.

I just wish everyone would leave and never have a good memory about me so I can kill myself.

EDIT:

Hey everyone, thank you so much for the support. I really didn’t expect so many of you to feel the same way. I appreciate all of you that are trying to help me out, I’ll try my best to reply to all the comments by tomorrow.

The next day brother was “looking for cough drops” at least that the excuse they used. And he looked in the box where I keep all of my SH tools in.  He then proceeded to go though my notebooks where he found some letters that were address to my family after I was dead but had never intended for anyone to read. I didn’t even want them to read them even if I had killed myself. He freaked out and showed them to my sister, who showed my dad. They then decided to search my entire room they went though every box and they took all the cloths out of my closet. They took everything out of my desk. Read though all of my notebooks. This happen last Wednesday and they didn’t tell me until Sunday. I saw my parents 3 Times between the time they found the notebooks and SH stuff. They said the his hospital told them to go though all of my stuff and they also told them not to tell me. I am really devastated that they read something so personal that I never wanted them to read.

Night is the worst. It's dark, silent, empty and I normally cry to sleep. It's easy to get out of bed if one of the kids are crying but if not it's hard. 


None of them will ever know her. She had loads of issues but I thought we could work them out. I thought she was better. 


I can't even read stories of death or suicide anymore it's too heartbreaking. I used to be able to read them but now I explode into tears and anger.

But nothing's changed. I still want to die and everything is still shitty.

The only person I ever loved and cared about stopped being my friend when I opened up about my mental health. Just completely abandoned me. Everything else in my life has been shitty but that has really been a kick in the guts. I keep reaching out, hoping she'll reply to me and be friendly one day. But on the rare occasion she replies it's ""I don't want to deal with you"", ""find someone else"", etc. I fucking have nobody else. Everything I've tried has failed. Getting nowhere I'm therapy.

d1z3jp,depression,life is a chore,"Having to wake up and immediately being struck with this shock of *I have to do this all over again.* Have to go to school, college, university or even work, we're stuck in our imaginative sociable, unsociable life. There are no questions to our daily duties, as we're following the propaganda of what others expect us to be. 

Just imagine yourself not fitting into those sets of species. We all supposedly ""have a purpose"" to fill, but what if you don't fit that category? Where do we go from there?

In my situation, I personally think I am not fit for this world. I suffer with a major physical health issue and that constantly affects my mental health. Similarly, my emotional health is just as bad and it deteriorates my motivation to do anything. I have no one personal and close that can fully understand my situation. I lost the one person I loved deeply and now she is with someone else. There's nothing and no one left to live for.

85ubu6,depression,It pisses me off that people think happiness is a choice,It just isn't. And not because I say it isn't. It just isn't. I try to turn my goddamn thoughts around to be positive every goddamn second of every goddamn day and it just does not do anything to make me feel better. Coping strategies just calm me down. Smiling is so damn fake and uncomfortable. I don't even know. 
9z3v5l,depression,"Slowly, I didn't realize I was already killing myself","First I killed the athlete. There wasn't much of him to begin with so it was easy. At the least he tried to give an effort to materialize during my college days. He even joined some after school group of friends to play with, that didn't really go anywhere.

Next I killed the gamer. He was easy to kill too because of the need, the corporate life taking much of my time didn't leave enough breathing room for him to keep up a fight. His antics still surface every now and then, making me wish for adventures and the blood pumping suspense or action of his previous endeavors. I just stuffed his mouth with career dreams, he didn't really struggle as he believed that to asphyxiate was actually reasonable.

Next I killed the party boy. This one, took a little bit more orchestration than the previous two. I had to kill his connections with his friends. I had to starve him of his former social saturation - and in a way that he won't easily recourse back. I made his friends believe he didn't need the contact, that he was happy. The party boy slowly lost his spirit, that's when I went for the jugular to end his pain.

Next I killed the musician. I almost didn't like killing him. He's the most recent one, and the most difficult one to get rid of. He has support your see. All the feelings and emotions closing through him everytime he hears, plays, or sings a song; gives him enough strength to push back. He's even made a solid group of friends that push and pull him to their graces, but an opening came in the guise of leaving the country - that tiny waver in his resolve let me sneak in a stab. It was easy enough from then on. 

I'm just afraid, that eventually, I might kill the writer too. And when I do, I don't really know what's left.

I'm actually surprised to realize that I've been hurting myself without physically doing so. I've lost more of myself in the past few months than I ever had in years. And I'm not making any more of me than what I already have.


PS. I wrote this to myself at a bad time about a year ago. And putting what I've been doing in words, has surprisingly help me curb and slowly regain ""myself"" throughout the past year. I still get spans of time where I feel like nothing, where I feel afraid of being nothing that I'd rather just lose my life. But remember all you've been through, things may not feel the best now but you are not worthless, you matter, there's a value to everything you've done and accomplished. So let's all hold on and hold tight :)


Edit: Thank you so much for giving my first gold kind stranger! And to everybody who's commenting I wish I had more time to reply to all of you, I'm surprised with the turnout and even more with how people feel the same and are/is going through ""losing"" parts of themselves. Let's all keep holding on to those and try our best not to lose more than we do. And for those who feel empty - it's never too late to find yourself, let's all fight for it, even if it starts with just getting up from your bed in the morning :)"

9th9br,depression,Anybody wish they were 8 years old again and could start their life over.,"I have made so many fucking mistakes in my life that I wish I could take back. My life is in shambles and I wish I could just magically start over. My laziness is the death of me and I constantly fight demons in my head. It would be much better to just cease to exist at this point. That seems very peaceful. Life is so complicated and we carry so many burdens and problems day in and day out that living is exhausting. 

I used to be optimistic and said things like it will get better and in 10-20 years I'll be a happy grown adult with many loving friends and family around me but every passing year is getting worse and worse. Everytime I think I hit rock bottom my life gets even worse and pointless. I won't get into specifics because there are too many to list but I am starting to feel like a pathetic failure. I always wanted to be the best and be someone who others could be inspired by but I just ended up becoming a no life bum. I wish I would just die while sleeping sometimes. Waking up and sleeping knowing i have to wake up again the next day are the worst feelings in the world. Just leaving my bed is a fucking challenge at this point. I wish I didn't feel this way but I do. I'll end this incoherent rant here and get it out of my system.

Like while they’re waiting for the train what do they think about if not jumping on the tracks and ending it right there?
Or seeing a building and wondering if the impact of jumping from it will be enough to kill them?
Do they just look at a tree with strong branches and think “what a nice tree that is” instead of which branch would be best to hang myself from?

How is it possible that some people just don’t want to die? Not to mention so many people who go through painful and expensive treatments just to stay alive. It makes me feel so guilty for all the times I’ve wished to get cancer so I can die without having to do anything. I wish I could donate my physical health to someone who needs it so I can just let my sick brain shrivel up and die."

EDIT: I thought you guys might want to know what kind of things I tried and what worked. I took 3 different kinds of antidepressants, I'm now on Paroxetine and they seem to work. I've tried therapists and that's not my jam. I spent 3 days in a psych ward after my overdose and I hated it there (other patients loved it though). The thing that worked most for me was reading. I read Furiously Happy by Jenny Lawson 4 times, and that's the book that helped me most. Also: the Tao of Pooh (I'm not religious), and books about being introverted because it made me realize I'm not crazy. And sometimes, I would just lie on the couch and watch bad reality tv. I keep a bullet journal now, playing with colours and just writing down 1 or 2 things I have to do each day. Do the laundry (but not fold it) and cook dinner. Stuff like that. And talk. And if you think that you don't have anyone to talk to, we're here. And I'm here. PM me, I promise I'll reply."

h88bej,depression,My brother plans to kill himself on 7/2,"Hi everyone,

I'm 24 y/o female, my brother is a 19 y/o. Mid May, my brother was taken to the hospital for attempting suicide. His online friends called his college to request a wellness check and got the cops involved. They found him unconscious in his dorm room. 

We have a very toxic mom. To give you some context, my mom told him ""Do it right the next time so we don't have to drive 8 hours to pick you up."" She loves us but she's very immature, toxic, physically abusive, mentally abusive, etc. She's sort of a horrible human being but in her mind, she has done all she can for us. She had me when she was 19, single mom, we don't talk to our dad. 

He's set on doing it again because my brother and I have an extremely close relationship and he doesn't want to be a burden on me. He has been failing school, hates my mom, and feels like if he kills himself, my life will become better because my mom will realize she is the problem. But my mom will never know that. He thinks I'll be sad for a couple of years but I'll get through it because I'm a strong person. He has told my boyfriend that he has bought 100 pills this time for his second attempt. 

My brother is the best. But my mom has fucked him up so much. He feels like he doesn't deserve my love and feels extremely guilty that I'll have to take care of him when I went through so much to get where I am. I just graduated with a masters degree and looking for a job on the west coast.

I also want to note there is a genetic component. On my mom's side, my grandpa, my uncle have killed themselves. My mom has attempted suicide when I was in high school by jumping off our apartment but survived. I have been depressed since age 7 but became healthy two years ago. My brother has felt this way since he was 10. I told him once I get a job I can take him away forever and help him get his life back on track but he doesn't want to burden me. 

What do I do? Has anyone been in a situation like this?"

4z1114,depression,"Today, I had my first session with my psychologist.","It was tense, I talked him through some dark stuff. He showed empathy like no other and I immediately felt like I already knew him and vice versa. 

At the end of the session he asked for my ID for administrative purposes. When he saw my date of birth and realized it was my birthday, he cracked up and through his chuckles he demanded, ""who the hell sets up an appointment on his birthday?!"" Of course, I couldn't care less if it was my birthday - I tend to forget my own age. However, his laugh was so genuine and from such a good heart, that *at last*, I recognized the ridiculousness and joined his laughter. 

It was the first time I felt 100% comfortable with another person in the same room. I couldn't have asked for a better present.

the heart of it all is that i have C-PTSD (along with other psych disorders) and these past few weeks I've been drifting in and out of disassociation, flashbacks, and episodes of crying fits. i can't stop reliving my trauma and am having a tough time with positive self-talk. right now i'd say my self-worth and self-esteem are at a 0. it doesn't help that i live in an abusive household but unfortunately i don't have anywhere else to go, and this is something I've dealt with my whole life. my mother is neglectful and my father is emotionally, verbally, and sometimes physically abusive. he picked a fight with me this morning for no reason and it set me over the edge. so between the flashbacks, disassociation, and deeply painful depression, i just feel so unsafe in my house. if my parents see me crying, they'll either gaslight or bully me. i just wish things were different. i don't really know where i'm going with this post other than it would be nice to be reminded that not everyone is mean and nasty. that i am a good person and i deserve a good life. i just want to stop crying.

edit: thank you for the wholesome, the silver, and the hugz  😭 😭 😭 i did not expect this post to get any attention let alone receive my first reddit awards. I'm crying tears of joy and hope now. thank you kind internet strangers, i will be sure to pay it forward. <3

i4ztxv,depression,I just want a hug,"That's all. It won't fix my Depression and it won't fix my existence. Everybody that's dear to me lives far away. I pretend to be alright to my family and parents cause i'm scared to break it to them, cause they might react with disbelief and tell me i should calm down. I did not have a real sincere hug in.... actually i don't know. I think like 7 years. I just want someone to hug me and tell me shit will be alright. I don't care if it's true or not. I'm introverted and why and would never for the sake of me engage in any physical contact like hugging with someone that gets me and that i like. I am also scared of telling ppl i do know and that know about my depression cause i think i would look weak and that they would make fun of me or whatever even tho that's very unlikely. I just want to feel like a human again, i really just want to have someone i like check in on me and not just send a meme and then be on their merry way. I just really, truly and from the bottom of my heart want a genuine hug i'm just that starved of physical contact cause i act and pretend that i don't like it while i wish for nothing else. Other people see me as this strong, independent guy doing his thing, going his own way and keeping his head up high while infact i just want to curl up cause i can't Deal with doing a Single mistake. Why do i have to be like this? I can't expect ppl do help me how i would need it if i don't tell them on the other Hand i'm scared cause i'm paranoid to be starved in the back. I feel like i will never be able to open to someone completly ever again, especially not in Person even tho that's the one and only thing i want to do.

Edit: I really wanna just thank you all for comenting and upvoting. I mean, i did not think for this to be successful in helping me a bit atleast. I kinda just wrote this cause i had a huge mental breakdown and didn't know what to do anymore. You guys commenting are not filling the void i want filled cause that's basically impossible for you to do but don't be fooled, i appreciate EVERY SINGLE PERSON that commented here giving good vibes. Some people wrote they feel it and also want a hug i just wanna say: Feel hugged atleast by me!. I love all of you writing here and i am really thankful for your support and you guys being so nice and cute. Good vibes to you all and i hope all of you feeling bad find a way to cope with shit and get better <3

Edit 2: I'm really overhwelmed by All of you guys coming here. I'm sad seeing so many people in the same state as me but i'm so happy some of you try to give the best Advice they possibly can. Maybe i haven't found myself but let me tell you, every Single one of you commentin changed something for me. Don't care who you are or where you are from. ALL of you are worth something and even tho alot wrote ""this probably won't change anything"" you taking the step to write a comment? That does change something. I appreciate everyone here and you all got my respect for dealing with this shit illness but trying to look out for each other. I love all of you <3"

7zx1dh,depression,Told girlfriend I'm suicidal and got kicked out,"Finally confided in my gf last night about my depression and she told her mom and everyone in my family and then she said I shouldn't live with her anymore. I got kicked out and she won't let me inside to get my things. We have a 6 month old daughter together.

I slept outside. It's 7 am now and I don't know what to do. I use her car to get around and now I don't have that. I also lost my job because she wouldn't let me go to work and I don't have friends or money for uber

htkzjq,depression,I am a 17 year old student in korea and I am stressed overwhelmingly by academics and the SAT. Please read my story and tell my story to others. I am going to jump next week. Goodbye.,"I just finished writing my final goodbye letters to my mom, dad, and brother. Goodbye. I want to talk to someone but I don’t know who. I’m planning on overdosing on lean or some other drug. I know that my parents will just say that depression and suicidal thoughts are just common and focus on my grade and GPA. I feel hopeless. I want to know where to take my  life from. No comfort or support will help me much. I feel like I’m better off gone than having to work more and study and prepare for school and the SAT. To me that is all there is to life. I’m sorry mom and dad. Even though I spent time with you I simply can’t get over it. Goodbye and I love you because this is not your fault. Thank you for all the memories and support you have me for the past seventeen years of my life. The times when you scolded me that if I didn’t get a good SAT score, then I would be sent to academies and my dog would be sent back to its previous home. These days believe it or not, I’ve been doing some things that a regular high schooler should not do like sipping lean, vaping, and taking sleeping pills to sleep at night from the nightmares. I hope I can overcome this, but that time seems to late. Goodbye."

8yvqlv,depression,How do people just accept working 40+ hours a week for the rest of their lives?,"I know this is just how society works--we have to work in order to benefit from the work of others...the exchange of labor. It seems like most people have just accepted this as reality. They get their work done and then enjoy the rest of their time and the things they get to do with the money they've earned working. But I can't seem to do that.

The idea of spending more than half my waking hours 5 days a week doing something I don't want to do and find stressful for someone else makes me feel so incredibly hopeless. It's only Saturday, and I'm already dreading entering a whole new workweek. This feeling gets much worse on Sundays. And then during the week, I come home from work and know I have to go back in a matter of hours, and the thought makes me miserable and basically ruins the time I don't have to be working. 

I feel like I spend 5 of my 7 days a week just wishing they were over. That's depressing to me. 

Anyone else feel this way? "

lazmim,depression,"I need at least one person to see this. I have 0 reason to live, because I can't care about my obligations to others.","If you google ""reasons to live"" they pretty much all say that they carry on living because they dont want to cause pain to their loved ones. I have very little loved ones, and I cant express enough how little I give a shit about how sad they're gonna be when I kill myself. There is no way they will feel as terrible as I do everyday, at least have the ability to get over it whereas I am condemned to this suffering until I die some other way. I think about how my girlfriend will feel if she finds out I've killed myself and I just do not care, I love more than anything, even more than myself, but I want death so badly that there is nothing that convince not to do it now. My mum, dad, brother, grandad, grandma and literally everybody in my family will be devastated beyond words, and I am fine with that. Because I will have victory for once, I will fixed it at the greatest possible cost and I'm glad. Their sadness is of no concern of mine when im fucking dead. 

I do not enjoy living, as I have stated in other posts. I dont care about the little things in life. The smell of freshly cut grass isnt a valid reason to fucking live, you jackass. I may laugh at things that are funny, and may enjoy making others laugh, and enjoy the company and love of my girlfriend, but it just isnt enough. I need some other way of relief of my problems if not suicide, I am not fucking willing to put in any hard work, because I could just kill myself lol. I need a giant stroke of luck, or a huge incredibly forgiving second chance that will just make everything go away. I wish all my problems could just be fixed by some miracle solution, and they all say it's just hard work that will fix it. 

But no pal, it's suicide and it's a legitimate solution. It ends my problems and that's all I want. I'm quite frankly sur people arent just okay with people suicide, and that it doesnt happen even more than it does. It's just such an absolute and perfect solution for everything, the only reason people stop is because they feel obligated to others, but I just dont have that filter. I feel oddly free in the solace that suicide gives me, whenever a new problem arises it doesnt affect me anymore because I know that one day I wont have to deal with this shit because I'll be dead and buried."

I let the rain fall on my face. I let it soak my sweater. I walked down the middle of the street while the pavement shimmered in front of me. I stood by the water while black waves rolled towards my feet and the wind blew rain into my face. I held my arms out and let the wind blow across my body. I waked through the park. I got on a swing in the playground and let my legs take me as high as I could, like when I was a kid. I spun in the middle of the street while water got in my boots and soaked my socks. I fucking skipped down the middle of the street, in the rain, without a soul around.

And I know I will eventually fall asleep and tomorrow will crush me like every other day. But I really felt alive tonight for a little while you guys. 

Sorry for the theatrics, the pinot is still working its magic. Happy Tuesday.

Edit: Just wanted to say how moved I am by other people sharing their similar experience or saying that this post made them feel happy or comforted.

hetkuq,depression,43 and completely lost,"I've never posted anything online before so I'll try to be succinct.  I'm 43 male, never married, no kids, on medical leave from my job for depression.  I'm so disappointed in the person I've become.  No matter how much I read or do, it's like I have not gained any wisdom on managing life's challenges.  I grew up in a loving home with lots of encouragement and high expectations.  I was an A student through college but my social skills have always been lacking.  I managed to work for the past 20 years, but I couldn't keep up in my current job, hence the medical leave.   

I've been in therapy for much of the past 10 years.  My psychologist believes I have traits of avoidant personality disorder.  I take several antidepressants and I'm currently two weeks into TMS therapy.  Nothing seems to help.  I'm unbelievably critical of myself.  Even now, as I write this message, I am certain that this will be the worst written message ever on Reddit.   I've been reading hundreds of other posts and they seem so well written.  I'm even more amazed by the responses.  How are you all able to find the words to share your wisdom and advice?  I read everything I can find on overcoming depression and avoiding suicide but it goes right through me and outv the other end with nothing retained.  I can't imagine giving advice to someone.  There is so little I can think of to say to people in distress.  

I'm a mess right now.  I have lost hope of getting better.  I don't exercise, I sleep 14 hours a day.  I have a house but I spend most nights at my parents.  Nothing traumatic has ever really happened to me.  The worst thing is that my ex-girlfriend cheated on me three years ago and I haven't dated since.  I have some solid friends that I've known since high school.  They are all very well adjusted and have careers and families of their own. 
I can't seem to learn anything these days.  I used to be smart but I am not longer able to learn new things.   I can't imagine surviving another 40 years.  I think about volunteering but I even tell myself that I have nothing valuable to offer.  I've no real skills to rely on.  I have saved about $300K in my 20 years of work. I had saved that money so that I could support having a family some day.  I no longer think I'm capable of having a family.  Too overwhelming.  I would be an awful spouse and father.
I don't plan to go back to work.  I plan to just live on my savings as long as I can and then end my life.  By then my parents will be gone and I won't hurt them.  My siblings and friends will be hurt in the near-term but they will be ok in the long run.  

I've read so much on coping with this disease.  But so little spurs me to action.  Until last year, I'm was microdosing with weed every morning to get myself going, keeping up with job and social occasions.  The weed stopped working for me though.  Now if I smoke, it gives me some paranoia that makes things worse.  

Thanks for reading all this.  I love you."

iv21g3,depression,I’m kinda disgusted with myself,"I have a depression nest. My bedroom is disgusting. I have a path from my door to my bed and that’s just about it. Everywhere else I have piles of clothes and old food containers and boxes and crap I don’t need. I have a hoarding problem on top of being too depressed to clean; my dad is a pack rat too so I’ve always spent my life in clutter. I don’t think it’s at TV show level but it’s still bad. Does anyone have tips/advice for finally cleaning up? I’ve been trying but honestly some days I pick up like 2 pieces of trash and toss a couple things in a laundry basket and I automatically feel drained.


I remember when my old roommate barged in to my room mistaking “I’m coming!” For “come in” I was always so careful about keeping roommates out of my room, always locking the door, because I was never more embarrassed. I saw the shock on her face as I rambled off reasons for the mess “I just dumped everything in here when I moved in, I’ve just been super busy with school and work has me exhausted” I know she didn’t buy it she must have thought I was the nastiest person alive, she asked if I wanted help but I declined and said I’d handle it. I never really did.


I can handle living in clutter. It’s all I’ve ever really known. I do wish I had a super cute and organized room but on the rare occasion I do try to organize everything it never lasts. But I feel so guilty. Guilty because I have a dog. He’s been my best bud for the last 15 years or so and he doesn’t deserve this life. Like I said we’ve always lived in a cluttered house but my room is the absolute worse. He gets fresh food and water and I try to take him outside often so there’s no accidents in here and he gets fresh air but he still does not deserve this. I know he walks around my piles of crap just fine and still runs full speed to see me when I walk through the door, his tail wagging so fast that his whole little body wiggles. I know he loves me and I love him with my entire heart. He’s one of the only things that keep me going because I’m afraid of what would happen to him if I were gone. I don’t think my family would be the best caretakers and I saw how the poor guy grieved when my mom died. I saw how he was confused and still went to her bedroom looking for her every single day for the longest time. When we’d pull up in the car he’d race to the passenger door and wait for her to come out. My family showed me how he kept finding his way into my room when I first left for college. I wouldn’t want to leave him hurt and confused like that so I keep pushing on. But I can’t let him keep living like this. 


I’m disgusted and deeply disappointed in myself but I’ll do my best to clean my room and throw some stuff away. It definitely will not be anywhere close to easy but I still want to try.


Edit: wow I did not expect to get such a huge response. I basically passed out on my bed right after posting this  but I only expected maybe 1 or 2 people to comment. Also a big thanks for the awards. It’s been a difficult path, I’ve been trying to clean for the past week or so and it feels like I haven’t made so much as a dent in the mess but I appreciate the kind words and motivation.

8xdnp7,depression,Started planning a road trip as an alternative to killing myself,"I've always wanted to travel by myself but always been too scared (I'm 22F). Now that I'm on the verge of killing myself it's like why not. I don't care anymore. I'm not doing anything with my time (summer break) and I have money to burn (probably shouldn't burn through it but whatever, it wouldn't be used if I was dead). At least I will get to be away from this town and state with all these horrible memories. 

Edit: I'm traveling from Baton Rouge. I'll probably just go through Texas (namely Houston and San Antonio) for a week or 2. It's not the craziest trip but I think big enough for someone who's never traveled alone. Hopefully if it goes well I can maybe plan another trip somewhere else before school starts 

Edit 2: OMG so many comments and messages. I can't believe so many people care about me taking a little trip. I'm reading through all of them and I appreciate all the tips and offers. I will update y'all after I leave (might be like a week) and will upload pics and stuff afterwards.

cxzfzt,depression,"I just went from not leaving my room for 3 years with the biggest fear of going outside, to wanting to solo travel again! In 3 days.","Hi I’m 21M and before this Friday morning, I had never traveled before in my entire life without my parents. No friends sitting in my room being depressed and lonely about how I’m getting further and further behind in life (still do) but I’ve improved myself so much in these 3 days.

I’ve eaten out for the first time, (like at a resturant), I been going to places I didn’t thought I could find, I’ve managed to use the city’s train to travel, didn’t think I could do that. I’ve gotten thoughts to wanna take pics on the places here like the view, but I’ve gotten thoughts saying it will look dumb but I’ve done it every time anyway!

I’ve been open to meet up with ppl, but I haven’t found anyone, and I’ve been giggling the entire time being here cause it’s so pretty and I just feel so free!

I lived in my own hotel room! Like wow. To me it’s just wow. I been continually saying to myself on my room “wow, just wow. Wow!!!” And freaked out cause I can’t believe I’m just doing this without LITTLE TO ANY ANXIETY!? Like hello?!

I ordered room service to eat, even tho I had anxiety about it! Of what he would think of me cause I’m alone in my room. But after going outside for 3h i needed a “social break” to get back the energy to go out. (Self love right?)

Now I’m at my hotel room and tomorrow I just gotta eat breakfast and then I go home. (By train btw! I never traveled this far, traveled at all rather without my parents and I TRAVELED ALONE CAUSE I HAVE NO FRIENDS!)

The clock is currently 9pm, I could go out and go to a club, cause I never been to a club but that feels too intimidating for me at this time. I don’t wanna operate in the night time with not knowing the streets etc. (I’m taking care of myself)

This is more progress I’ve done in a friday-Sunday trip then I’ve done in 3 years sitting on my room and only operating in my small city.

I’m so proud of myself!

Feels lonely tho so I kinda wanna cry, I’m imaging how awesome this trip would’ve been (even more awesome) if I had a friend or ultimately a boyfriend with me! (I’m gay)

I’m so proud of myself. I wanna cry right now cause I’m going home tomorrow,I thought I would never say this, but I can’t wait to travel again! Preferably with someone this time!

I know this sounds cringe and I can’t believe Ive done this. I’m so confused why I don’t have panic attacks and stuff! But if I can do it, you can do it too. It really isn’t that scary, when u have small “missions” all the time to think about. I gotta go to x to eat and I gotta go see y and I gotta go check what train I’m taking for tomorrow, etc. these small missions keeping me  busy.

I know that when I get home tomorrow, it’s back to normal and misery waiting for me. But this was, I gonna say it SUPER FUN! I haven’t had this much fun in sooo many years!

I feel alive.

bxktkp,depression,So I bought myself flowers today.,"No special occasion. I just had a tough day at work so I picked up a big bunch of tulips on the way home. Not the cheap ones either, but the lovely fresh perfectly blooming crisp and colorful kind. ""What's the big deal?"" you're probably thinking. The big deal is that there was a time in the not so distant past that the thought of ""treating myself"" to anything ""just because"" filled me with guilt, shame and self loathing. You don't deserve it. It's too good for you. You're not worth the time/effort/money. You are nothing and you have nothing to offer so you deserve nothing in return. 


So now I really appreciate any small act of kindness I afford myself. Yes, there are still days that I force myself to have a cold shower in the morning just because I hate it. I love cooking delicious food for other people, but I still sometimes eat instant noodles when I'm alone and having a bad day because it's a waste of time to cook just for me.

I'm so happy it put a little smile on a few faces and even happier if it reminded even one of you wonderful people to be a little kinder to yourself. You're all awesome!!! And to the lovely stranger who gave me gold, thank you from the bottom of my heart for that. It was a nice surprise to wake up to this morning and put a little pep in my step today :)"

c49m8a,depression,"In 8 days I have lost my job, my girlfriend left me and I’ve diagnosed with cancer.","I feel so overwhelmingly sad. My whole life has crumbled so quickly. 

I’ve lost my job because I can’t focus at work. I can’t get a grip of my emotions and spend all day walking around like a zombie. 

My girlfriend has left me because she says she can’t be in a relationship with me anymore, I am absolutely in love with her and don’t know what I will do on my own. 

The cancer was diagnosed last week, stage 2. I have to go for surgery soon to establish if it’s moved on to stage 3. Strangely, this is the part that least upsets me. 

I don’t know what to do. I feel like I want to sleep, but I can’t. I want to be numb to all this. To make the pain stop but I can’t. All I do is cry constantly, I just don’t know what to do.


EDIT:  Oh my goodness. I went to sleep last night, finally. Woke up and saw the absolute outpour of messages on here. You guys are unbelievable. I can’t even begin to describe my gratitude that people who don’t know me would spend time sending such thoughtful messages. I love every single one of you. Thank you so much."

Nor do I possess the capacity to voice my feelings aloud. Whenever I try talking with a friend I just clam up. I don't understand myself. I don't understand why I am like this. Why can't I just express how I'm feeling. Maybe because expressing feelings aloud makes them real or permanent. A perspective voiced gives permenamce to those thoughts.

l8sivo,depression,Many pandemic-depressives didn't have empathy for mental health sufferers until it affected them.,"Once the pandemic is over, they'll recover and resume their lives forgetting their empathy for others. 

I've been depressed from childhood  and no one cared. Imagine going through racism, bullying, social exclusion and loneliness from 5 years old to adulthood.

I've put in tremendous efforts in improving myself and meeting people through various ways, yet, I get turned down because of my appearance (race and being not conventionally attractive etc.) or my quiet/ introverted personality and therefore, written off as ""weird"". How wonderful it would be to have friends that genuinely care.

Some of these people posting on social media about caring for others and reaching out are doing it just for the likes and popularity. So many of these phonies are the same assholes that would not give me/ people like me the time of day despite  ""reaching out"" to them. 

They're nothing but insincere and hypocrites that have in the past, contributed to the loneliness and mental health issues of others.

8kmlu5,depression,You ever just get so fucking sick of yourself?,"I don't mean just general regret for your life choices. I mean seriously annoyed with every thought you have, or the state of your living place, or even banal things like the way your clothes fit, or how your hair is hanging that day.

I don't know. I guess I'm just frustrated enough to bury my head in a pillow and give up on the day again."
l7ru4t,depression,i honestly can't tell if i'm depressed or lazy as shit,"hi everyone, using a throwaway to avoid identification.

as i (19F) write this, i'm on the verge of tears and have a lump in my throat for no discernible reason. before this, i spent the whole day lying in the same spot watching tv, save for the one time i got up to make myself instant noodles. at dinner, i started tearing up because i was disappointed with the food (this is kinda embarrassing). my mum keeps asking me why i'm always lying down (not in a malicious way or anything) and i can't really pinpoint the reason but i'm always unexplainably exhausted. the good days are fine and sometimes really good, but the bad days (like today) just really suck. i feel like i am suspended in time and everything is in slow motion. i have wasted yet another day.

for some context, i'm in a transitional period in my life (graduated from high school, waiting to start college in october). i've had some moments of euphoria here and there that made me feel at the top of the world (got accepted to some really good schools etc.). however, for the most part, nothing really excites me. this is a real low compared to my last 2 years of high school (consistent high achiever, top student for a bunch of subjects, you get the gist) during which i felt some degree of fulfilment because i kept getting told i was good at things. i notice that, when i'm not occupied by the hustle and bustle of school, i always get like this more intensely than otherwise (like during summer vacations).

another thing- every single friend of mine has been motivated enough to get a job and do stuff that excites them. i've barely done anything. the only 2 things i managed to bring myself to do in the last 3 months were the result of me being talked into them by various people. i am a major pushover so obviously i ended up doing them. i just cannot bring myself to apply for a part time job because everyday i just go ""i am tired and i'll do it another day"". i feel like shit because i don't know if i have a problem or if my problem is just that i'm lazy.

my head is really heavy as i write this, so i apologize for my stream-of-consciousness writing style. the reason why i'm so confused is that, when i am in social settings, i'm really lively and fun. i'm also a very typical ""gifted"" kid / overachiever  with much less to worry about that my friends who are on the edges of their seats trying to figure out what to do in the future and shit. i have a loving family and supportive friends. i am grateful for everything i have, but i just get extremely blue and temperamental for no reason sometimes. i don't dare to discuss this with anyone i know because nobody would expect this from me. 

i don't know if this information helps but i typically feel like this during long holidays. basically, if people arent giving me responsibilities, i can't bring myself to do anything.

i'm so sorry i don't have the ability to organise this coherently right now, but could anyone share what depression can feel like? or at least give me a reality check if i really am just lazy and melodramatic? some clarity would be amazing. please be as candid as possible because if it really just is an attitude problem, at least i can stop being self-pitying and start doing something about it. 

just a disclaimer: i have never seriously considered suicide but from time to time i wonder what it would be like to just disappear. don't worry about me being a danger to myself because i would never do it.

that was a really long post. if you read to the end, thank you :)

g41t6v,depression,Annus Horribilus,"Today is the anniversary of my daughter's death. She died in my arms, and I am grateful I could be with her. She was 25, and we were very close; cut from the same cloth.
She had long suffered depression and social anxiety which manifested in anorexia and alcoholism, creating 'the perfect storm' that resulted in her death. She made no secret of her desire to die, but her death wasn't suicide, per se.
In the year prior to her passing I was diagnosed with esophegal cancer, and spent a lot of time in hospital getting treatment. Nobody expected me to live, and I think this hit my daughter especially hard as she was very emotionally dependent on me.
During my time in hospital my ex wife, my daughter's mother, came to stay with my daughter to care for her. I've since discovered, from reading my daughter's reddit, emails and texts, that her mother was drink and abusive the whole time.
I demanded to be released from hospital early, as my daughter's health had deteriorated, and they made arrangements to get me home. I was unable to speak in more than a whisper, had no esophegas and was fed through a tube in my stomach but I was happy to be home with my daughter. We spent quality time together.
When she died a few weeks later I arranged the funeral and the wake. I couldn't deliver a eulogy, or even toast her life.
My daughter had very few friends, partly because of her treatment resistant depression, and partly because she just didn't suffer fools lightly. But the friends she did have she treated like gold. One was hospitalised after a failed suicide attempt, and my daughter drove 400 kms to visit him, and she went back every day for days on end, just as example. None of them could manage to get to her funeral.
I have recovered, mostly, now. But I don't know why. I don't want to live. Especially after this past year.
I am posting this not out of self pity but as a belated eulogy to my very, very special daughter. Without her the world is black and white and devoid of happiness."

lsyxvb,depression,Is it worth waiting to see if your life eventually ever gets better?,"I’m about to turn 25 and I don’t even want it this year. The disingenuous attention is going to bum me out.

Long story short, I lost my job and then got stuck at my parents house. My dad is very narcissistic and toxic and is often damaging to my mental health.

I spent this past year developing myself more, learning more into my career, reading books, becoming spiritual, and finding a cause to do good in the world. I figured all of this is pointless I might as well spend it doing at least one thing that’s bigger than me and then I can die happy. I don’t need to be famous I just wish I can move the needle positively in society or in a community in some way. 

I don’t know what that is yet but I’m learning a lot of marketing and I consider myself a creative and passionate individual. I am a musician also. I also volunteer and am involved but it’s all remote. 

Right now I don’t have a real job, I have no friends, and now my band is falling apart. Last year, no one showed up to my birthday gathering, which is kind of what caused me to start this journey. I can start a new band by myself, and I can move out and find new friends that aren’t toxic and like me and respect me, maybe even find a girlfriend. I used to have at least a couple of those things at different points in my life. I’ve been through 12 salary paying job interviews these past 2 months and none of them bite.

Now I have NOTHING. And I spent a year on myself for NOTHING. I have friends family and my therapist keep telling me “just wait, your time will come” and other similar pointless advice that gives you nothing tangible to work with and instead is just “your life sucks, you can’t do anything about it, just wait and see if it gets better”

Well what if it doesn’t? What if I get hit by a car tomorrow? God, I really hope I do. I mean, I’m thankful that I’m healthy and alive under a house but I still pay exorbitant bills and it’s really not easy even with a garbage freelance job

I don’t want to live through this bullshit anymore. It’s been a year. I want my reparations back for all the people who lied to me for all this time. 

Am I being a freak or what? Why can’t I just catch a fucking break?

cbhfwy,depression,Therapy just made me more aware of how isolated I feel because most people suck at empathy,"I’ve been in therapy for years. In that I’ve been able to identify what has made me so depressed growing up and I try to deal with it. I spend a lot of time using coping methods and trying my best. For a depressed person I manage to excel in life.

Currently dealing with the sting of a breakup. Went on vacation to Asia and Ex broke NC before my trip to wish me well after what I gather was him finding out the grass isn’t greener.

I’m on a dream vacation with my older sister and her child while we visit her fiancé. A lot of my depression is triggered from a childhood of being parentified and also unappreciated and invalidated.

My sister spent my formative years teasing me for liking Asian culture and is now jet setting to my fantasy destination because of romantic love. Wasn’t enough that I liked something or it meant something to me for her to care or treat me right. Nope. Only a man would make her culturally open and respect me and my interests.

I was livid. I had been journaling, using positive self talk, etc but all I could think is “wow, people only care about me when I can offer them something.”

Creative services, language skill, advice, emotional support,child care...if there isn’t a task or skill I can do people rarely give a fuck about me.

I didn’t want to share this, and told her I needed a moment to collect myself and she kept bothering me until I cried at a shrine. I told her why I was upset and she kept telling me to put it aside because “we’re on vacation”. I turned on my data to call my mom, she told me to pay a tour guide to take me places and hung up on me when I asked to be heard instead of throwing money at my feelings.

I literally just wanted someone to put themselves in my shoes for 2 seconds and be a broken-hearted 20 something who is the third wheel to a family and a newly wed couple, but is trying her fucking best.

I didn’t need to spend more money on experiences.
I didn’t need to pretend I wasn’t upset.

I just fucking wanted someone to walk in my very capable shoes for 30 seconds and realize the only thing I want is a little goddamn empathy.

My family rarely thanks me for things. They don’t care unless I’m in crisis or isolating. I’ve learned to ask for what I need but it doesn’t matter because unless I have extreme reactions they can’t be bothered to hear me.

I am happy for my sister. I truly am. But jfc I am planning and helping with her wedding in the midst of a serious breakup . Which she also teases me about and infantilizes my heartbreak.


Feelings don’t go away because you’re on vacation. Therapy taught me to deal with my shit, but unless I act in bad old ways my family doesn’t react.

I am more than a babysitter or a social media paparazzi. I’m part of this family too.

TL;DR depression reared it’s head on exotic vacation. Talking through issues got me yelled at...

The issues were caused by me putting my head in the sand and NOT being proactive. Before, I ALWAYS took the INITIATIVE and CREATED opportunity. Slowly but surely I lost that ability and piece by piece my world came crumbling down. 
So, my story is different than a young person facing depression as a sophomore in college, or a 16 year old afraid to tell their parents about their depression. I care about what they write because I have 2 children (30, 25). And I hope they never experience what we are going through.
BUT, I still read EVERY new post, because I hope to find the Answer to my condition. 
Ok, time to go and look at the Pile of important things to do, and decide if I am going to take the INITIATIVE or go into my typical Depressive State.
Have a good day. "

7bv27g,depression,"Diagnosed with cancer, mom passed away, wife asking for a divorce. All within a few days.","To my surprise, 3 of of the worst things that a grown man can experience has happened to me within the lapse of a week.

First, diagnosed with stomach cancer, then 2 days later, receive a phone call to inform me that my mom has passed away. Immediately I take the first flight back home to attend the funeral and help. Next day, after the funeral, I phone my wife for emotional support but instead I get the divorce talk. Unbelievable.

All of these things were completely unexpected. Right now I'm busy taking care of my mom's affairs and making sure my dad and brother are ok, but I can tell the next few months will be hard and sad.

I've never been depressed. I exercise regularly, eat right, go out, etc. But I don't think I will be the same after all this.

f9ita6,depression,February 22nd 2020,"I almost killed myself this past Saturday. I’m not sure if I was fully committed but I was invested enough to write a note, tidy up my room, and pick out which pills I was going to use to do it. My last cry for help was me sending my goodbye messages to my loved ones, I must’ve subconsciously known someone would come rescue me from myself. My friend came, my roommate came, my mother came... I took 6 pills but what I didn’t tell them that I kept slipping myself more. I knew I wouldn’t die but I wanted to come close— I wanted to know if death was truly what I wanted and if I got it I suppose my choice would’ve been made either way. My dad, whom I love dearly, flew in to be near me and I so very much appreciate it but to be quite honest, I don’t think this will be the last time I do this.

d0askq,depression,I'm 36 and stuck in years of misery. Depression is my self identity now and I don't know how to change it. Planet earth literally seems pointless and I dont' know how billions of people can just live these meaningless lives.,"I've had depression such a long time and I too feel like its too late to achieve anything meaningful with my life, or even become the most basic description of what most people would consider a moderately successful adult.   I'm 39 working this grocery store job that literally cannot advance anywhere and it barely covers the bills - but it does enough for me to live on my own which I'm grateful for - that is a success I guess.  But I'll be honest as well - the job is fucking miserable all day customer service orientated for snobby rich health-obsessed and trendy people. Being stuck at this job (its the best money I can find now) literally makes me want to kill myself when I leave a shift there.  I've got a manager right now who hates me and if you know what ""constructive discharge"" means that is what seems to be happening at work.

So anyway I recently got hurt at work and typing at and using a computer at home like this is about the only thing I've been able to do for about two weeks now to interact with anyone.  I can't drive very much while hurt like this so it really sucks like I can barely manage to make a trip to the store for some basic shit I need.  I have to get completely whacked on medication (which can be fun if you like it - but I don't like it when it is involuntary) to try to do anything physical around the house (like I HAD TO do this one thing or I'd get a fine) and even then it is just so painful and hard to move.  It will probably be this way another couple weeks but maybe I can heal faster, I don't know.  It seems like doctors where I am just will not prescribe pain medication anymore because there are too many people abusing it - so now I can't get some pain meds when I legit need them which just reminds me of another stupid aspect of our society failing.

I really don't see much point in my living at all when I am just going through the motions of life but I'm miserable.  I can get by financially (so far) but I don't want to just get by while I feel shitty and useless and unable to advance myself.  I hate it and there is no point to living this way - and theres several billion people living out this same lifestyle right now.  I don't know how so many people are ok with these pointless lives - I guess they are happy enough with that?  I am not ok with it at all.  Hurting my family is the only reason I am waiting or haven't already gone through with it.  We don't get along so great right now but I would still never want to hurt them in that way.

I gotta add, just to be honest and inclusive, that I have anxiety as bad as I have depression.  It's almost agoraphobic - like it is actually becoming a fear of leaving my house for the million things that could go wrong.  Being stuck here I am not happy but I guess I am safe.  I shouldn't have to live like this, no one should.

thanks"

lfy4fr,depression,"35 year old male, major depression, I am afraid to go back to work. Dreamless sleep is my new fav thing.","Hi, I just wanted to check in and join the club with y'all. I've been depressed for as long as I can remember. The last 4 years it turned into major depression. I'm just scared. I don't want to die, and i just want to stop thinking about suicide. 

I'm fighting as hard as I can, but it's not going away. I take my meds, and have been seeing a dr. for 6 years. I'm on effexor, wellbutrin, lorazepam for sleep, and then clonidine to stop the nightmares. Ritalin for focus, armor thyroid for energy, and I haven't started yet but probably testosterone soon. 

I work out a lot. So i'm in great shape. I attract females but then watch then lose all attraction EVERY TIME as they realize something's wrong with me. This rejection hurts way more than just straight up right-off-the bat rejection, because it's just a constant reminder that i'm too flawed to be loved. Now i'm so afraid of the rejection i can't even be normal around them, i tremble, stutter, say stupid cringey things. 

Everyone in my family is dead except for my dad (who doesn't really like me), and some distant cousins. It feels like everyone doesn't like me. 

I hate this fucking illness. I feel like i'm in hell and I don't know what i did to deserve to be here. 

I am afraid to go back to work. I am a geologist, but if you only have a BS, then you're stuck in the oilfield. It's very lonely out there, I don't fit in, everyone makes it apparent that i'm weird. it's 12.5 hour shifts for however long it takes to drill the goddamn hole. Work, Cry, Sleep, Repeat. for weeks. 

Then if I'm lucky, I get 2 weeks off to scramble to try to find someone to love me.

I'm self destructive with the things I say and do. Sometimes it seems like i'm trying to ruin my own life, just so i can push myself over the edge and finally do it. 

I really miss liking to do things. I used to like going places, playing video games, playing guitar. 

Anyway, Hi, I'm here with y'all. Cheers."

ltevc3,depression,my genitalia are destroyed after being raped and being prescribed lexapro. i don’t want to live anymore,"being raped and being on lexapro ruined my genitalia, and it’s ruining my state of mind. please help

hey yall. not sure how to start this so i think i’ll just get into it. at 12/13 years old, i (f19) started feeling deep depression due to extreme bullying at school. i started therapy, and then lexapro at 17. my anxiety decreased, but i now also had an extremely low sex drive plus genital numbness. i decided that was better than daily panic attacks and constant depression, so i took the pill regularly and properly. 

when i was 18, i was unfortunately raped several times by my long-term boyfriend, who i considered to be the love of my life. what was left of a sex drive was now destroyed, now matched with even deeper depression and incredibly, incredibly low self worth regarding my body and my sex life. 

not long after that, i was diagnosed with spastic pelvic walls, or an extreme form of vaginismus. ive always been incredibly ‘tight’ for a lack of better words, not able to fit a tampon, usually passing out from extreme panic and pain when i tried. i’m not able to have proper sex because of it. the only time i’ve been penetrated was by my ex when he would rape me, and that was the worst pain of my life, physically and emotionally. 


i’m now 19, and i’m in a happy committed relationship. i love him deeply, and he’s a great partner. however, i find myself so depressed that i can’t provide for him sexually. not only for his sake, but for mine. my entire genital region is broken, and it makes me feel like less of a woman for it. i understand that a working vagina (or any vagina for that matter) is not what makes a woman, but it’s the only way i can describe it since there’s no proper term for female emasculation. 


ive started wellbutrin and stopped lexapro around two weeks ago, and im very anxious to not see any improvement. i also start pelvic floor therapy next month to help with my pelvis spasms. 


i understand that it can take up to three months, but im looking for reassurance from others in the same boat.


i can’t keep doing this anymore. i hate myself and body, and suicide is constantly on my mind. if anyone has dealt with this or something similar, i’d love to hear your advice. thank you :)

(please do not tell me that sex isn’t that important. ive had several people tell me it’s okay to not have it in our lives, but this is way deeper than that. this is now a physical issue.)"
d0t7yd,depression,I socially isolate myself and then wonder why people don't ask to hang out.,"It seems like all of my close friends have moved on and made better friends. A big part of me doesn't blame them - they seem happy and for that I am glad. It's not like they haven't reached out before. They did, and I was guarded and made excuses not to hang out. Nobody knows how to talk to a friend who is deeply depressed. It must be difficult.

A few weeks ago, some of my coworker friends planned a night out for this weekend and invited me. I accepted and was looking forward to it, but a few days ago my one friend told me it had been moved to a later date due to scheduling conflicts. I saw tonight through her Instagram story, several of them ended up going out anyway as a group - it looks like they decided to go without me for whatever reason.

I'm always wondering, 'How long can I keep it up this time?'

When the time comes that I finally admit it's all pointless, that my life will be terrible no matter what I try to do, it always feels more like accepting reality than depression. 

This is always reasserting my belief that any sort of medication or therapy that actually had any sort of positive effect (none ever has) would just be a delusion. Like Cypher knowingly going back into the Matrix to be able to eat ""steak."" It just seems like a dishonest existence...and then I tell myself I'd rather be sad in the real world then happy living a delusion.

In my opinion, that's seriously low. They don't know what they've been through. How are you going to call someone cowardly if you don't know their story, or have never felt the exact feelings they felt? Everyone processes pain differently. Even though it could be ""no big deal"" for you, it could be pain and anguish for someone else. There is no such thing as a coward, everyone is brave in one way or another.

Sorry for the vent/rant but I seriously hate life... but I'm too stubborn to give up. And I don't want to be called a coward because of the few times I've thought about ending things because they got too hard or stressful. I don't necessarily mean killing myself, but I've thought about giving up getting life together, getting in shape. Because depression is so hard to break out of. But I will always keep trying."
73o2tr,depression,No one showed. I should have expected that.,"I've only ever had one friend in my life. I've tried to make more, but people hate me. I've gone to community events, parties, hobby shops...etc to meet people. People just don't seem to click with me. I'm seen as odd, annoying, weird to name a few things I've been called. The only person I can call a friend is my wife. And I still do not understand how that came along. She just gave me a chance and looked at my oddities a little different.

Earlier this year, my wife discovered I have never had a birthday party. I never really had any friends to have a party, so I just never tried to have one. She said that was an injustice and I should have a party and invite friends from facebook.

She decided to throw me a party a few weeks ago. We planned it out for a month. Made all the decorations by hand, hand cooked all the snacks and food, even made our own party games to play. Sent out invitations to people on my facebook, her friends. We even got RSVPs back. It all seemed like my first birthday party would be fun. I was hopeful coming up on the day. 

Then the day of the party happened. We rushed to get it all finished before the party start and we were excited. The party start time came and 30 minutes later, no one was here. No big problem. Everyone always comes to a party late. 2 hours later, still no one came. I started to eat my snacks by myself. 

We got various excuses throughout the night. ""I got sick"", ""Stuff has come up"", ""car isn't starting"", ""No babysitters"", ""My boss just called me in"". 

My wife went to bed early. She was upset and mad. I told her it's ok. I am strong outwardly for her. I don't want her to feel bad no one likes me. But I am being eaten up alive. I am now in my 30s and I can't ever said I've had a true friend (other than my wife of course. I'm thankful she gave me a chance.). 

I don't know what is wrong with me or why I seem to be broken. I never should have had this party because ever since then, I just can't get it out of my head. Everyone time I would say outloud to my wife or family, they would tell me, ""Don't say that. Plenty of people are your friends. You're just being negative."" Now my wife truly sees what I mean. 

If I would have just told my wife no to the party, she wouldn't have been upset, and I'd still be ignoring the problem of me being friendless.

Edit: Everyone, thank you for all of the birthday wishes. Trying to get through replies and messages. Didn't expect this many messages. Thank you all again.

Edit 2: I see a lot of messages telling me to be thankful for my wife. I am very thankful for her. She is the best thing that has ever happened in my life and I'm the best that ever happened in hers. We have been through everything together even homelessness. That being said, I feel as if she isn't enough socially for me. We are 2 different people and even though we share a lot of interests, we do not share all of them. Sometimes, it is nice to have other friends to share your other interests with too. Example: She hates the show *It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia*. She hates it to a point that if I watch it, it should be on my PC with headphones so she doesn't need to hear it. I do it because I can understand it frustrates her. But I love the jokes so much and I see random stuff in the world and laugh because it reminds me of IASIP, but I have no one to share it with except the subreddit."

a6qv8n,depression,I sold my guns.,"They originally belonged to my grandpa; I'm not a hunter but we used to go out target shooting and I was a pretty good marksman. When he died, he left me two of his old rifles. They've mostly sat locked in my closet ever since, worth a lot of money but unable to let go of them, partly out of sentimentality, but I'd come to realize that I also felt compelled to keep them around for more troubling reasons.

My depression has been lifelong and I've had varying degrees of success fighting it; recently things have been okay but I've had a nightmare of a time with intrusive thoughts. Impulses to do things I don't even want to do would pop in to my head at the worst times and I would fixate on the details of the aftermath until I would bring myself either to tears or to panic.

""What if I just went up there and did it? Would my wife be better off in the long run? Would the friends I haven't spoken to in years show up?""

This is shit I do not need running through my mind.

Two years ago I was feeling better. I was finally getting serious about art and photography again; I actually started selling prints and even had a little space in a local gallery for my work. Then the grey returned, and I started seeing less and less worth going out to see... Then the darkness came back and I became convinced that those things I used to see and enjoy were gone now and nothing good was on the horizon.

So, last week, I made a decision. Packed up the guns, all the ammo I had left, and drove to the sporting goods store.

I got $2200 cash for the pair of guns, and on the way home I stopped by Best Buy and bought myself a Fujifilm X-T3 for just around $2000.

Later that evening, the intrusive thoughts returned as I tried to think about dinner...

""What if I just went up there and--""

Then it cut off. The pressure was gone. Went up there and what? Grabbed the camera I've always wanted and started taking pictures?

I did. I cursed the cold, bundled up, grabbed my new gear, and lost myself in the woods, taking pictures of snowflakes and a family of deer that happened to wander though.

I've been shooting the camera for the last week and I can't put it down. I feel something; I'm really fucking good at this and I'm motivated to do it. My worst impulses have been stopped in their tracks and replaced by the desire to improve and surprise myself.

It's always going to be a struggle for me and I know that, but I feel free in a way that I never really expected.

blpehw,depression,I disappointed everyone that expected great things from me,"When I was attending high school, i was top of my class with a dream of attending an ivy league university, particularly MIT. All my teachers were extremely proud of me. My parents were excited for my future in education. My peers thought highly of me. However, once the middle of my junior year came, i was faced with an overwhelming mental breakdown and fell into a depression.

I would spend sleepless nights doing schoolwork with already unstable mental health or i would do completely nothing and think. I eventually started to think about why i am doing this and realized that i dont like this traditional route im going on, nor will the results of it make me happy as i am already depressed doing the things i should like doing.

at that moment, my life lost its meaning. near the end of my junior year into senior, i stopped taking care of myself, developed insomnia (due to my obligation to try and keep up with my AP classes and my thoughts relentlessly wandering), and slept in all my classes. 

my teachers, parents, and peers as a result started looking down at me, wondering why i became such a ""disappointment"" according to my principal when i wanted to lighten my workload. this put me in the deepest depression of my life as i felt i failed everyone and destined to be nothing. 

i would resort to cutting myself, drinking, taking old prescription pills, and withhold from eating as a way to ""punish"" myself. 

to make this short, i decided to make my main way of attaining happiness is music. that is my dream. everyone is still disappointed in me and it weighs heavy on me. i wish it could go away. 

this was more of a medium to vent instead of ask for help as i am not feeling well at the moment. thank you if u actually do read this."

I feel like the only thing that has prolonged my life is my cat. We are very close, especially since I've been housebound with the pandemic. She's always following me around. When I'm upset or crying, she gets in my lap to comfort me for hours. She sleeps on my chest every. night.

Every time I think about committing the act, I start to imagine what her life would be like after my passing. There's no way anyone in my family would keep or take care of her, so she'd probably end up in a shelter, where she'd be confused and depressed and constantly waiting for me to show up. Taking care of her is the only purpose I have in life, and I'm so grateful to her for giving me a reason to stick around year after year.  


EDIT: Thank you for the overwhelming response of kindness and support from this community. I wasn't expecting it, and it made my day. It seems like the general consensus is that I should get another cat, and I agree. It's something I'm looking into, and I'll be sure to update when I get a second furry friend. "

The whole covid thing made it way harder to distract myself as much as I did before, which made me realise how my life really looked like.

Recently it went out again and after procrastinating for days I finally called the technician. He told me that the like last time, this time too the circuit board was out. He changed it and gave me the bill. I was like the circuit board had a 1 year warranty and it had only been 8-10 months. He looked at me for a few moments and then handed me the last time's receipt. It way dated May, 2013. 
At that time it struck me; I had no clue of the past 5 years of my life. I was on the bed surviving and still doing the same. I just can't stop crying since he left.

I also feel tremendously guilty when I get down because I remember all the people in the world with disabilities who would do anything to be in my predicament because it pales in comparison.

8lnteu,depression,You can never have an honest conversation about suicide,"When I was 18, someone at school had found a rough draft of my suicide note. I had planned on killing myself at the end of that week. The following events were an absolute  shit storm. 

My at the time girlfriend was devastated, my father was a wreck, my mother acted cold to me, and the whole school found out that their thoughts on “that crazy asshole” may have been justified. 

It’s been almost 3 years since then and I’ve seen therapists twice since. The part I hate the most about therapists is how you can’t have an honest conversation about suicide and wanting to die. When they ask “Do you have thoughts of suicide?” or “have you made plans of suicide?” I know I have to answer “No” because if I’m honest and say “Yes. This is my plan” then I’m going to get thrown back into the Psych ward for an indefinite amount of time for my “safety”

If I can’t be 100% honest with the person that’s supposed to help me, then how am I supposed to get any help. 

When I realized this I stopped seeing a therapist. Even after she promised me to keep coming in. 

At this point I feel like I have to fight this alone. "

EDIT: Thank you all so much. It means a lot to me that it means a lot to you.

""Okay, imagine you're playing an RPG and you've been going through the most hellish dungeon ever. You've been unprepared, underleveled and barely survived. Then at the end you find one of the most awesome pieces of loot ever. It's called the cape of depression. It's completely OP. Putting it on would give you immunity to nearly everything the game can throw at you. Sure, there are some negative stats on it too, but those seem managable. You put it on.

And it's as awesome as you thought it would be. Nothing can harm you. It doesn't deflect or defend you against attacks, they simply pass through you. Nothing can touch you anymore. Swords, arrows, fireballs, doesn't matter. It's all the same to you, because you simply dont feel it anymore. For some time you feel like a god. You glide through the masses and it's exhilerating. Nobody can touch you. You're completely free.

But the cape has disadvantages. It doesn't just let attacks pass through you, but also any blessings, healing spells and potions. Sure, it's a bit inconvenient at first, but you'll manage. After all nobody can hurt you anymore, so you dont need these kind of things anymore. Actually you dont even miss them anymore. Since you put on the cape everything has felt the same anyway and those signs of affection dont have any practical purpose to you anymore, so why bother? 

So you continue with your quest, wrapped in the cape. But somehow it doesn't feel the same anymore. Nobody can hurt you anymore, so you walk right through your enemies, not bothering to fight. Nobody can heal or comfort you anymore, so you walk right through your allies too, not bothering to talk. It's just you and the cape. 

It's starting to get boring so you think about trying it without the cape, but as you try to take it off, you look down at yourself and realize that you're still carrying the very same injuries you got in the dungeon in which you found the cape. They never healed, but you never got any more either. Then you remember how difficult and dangerous it was without the cape. It's easy to remember too, after all you have those injuries to prove your point. You need the cape, so you decide to leave it on.

At some point things just happen around you without you taking notice anymore. Nothing can affect you, neither good or bad, so why bother? You're truly like a god now, but not in the grand, majestic kind of way. You are simply not in touch - both literally and metaphorically - with the normal people around you anymore. Maybe you're mildly confused and irritated by them. Why do they act like they do? What's the point?

You dont want to feel left out, like a freak, so you pretend to still be in touch with them. The cape helps you. It grants you a +10 to Acting and Deceiving when talking about yourself. And you need that buff, because if someone would come to close to you, touch you, they would see that they pass right through you and realize something is very, very wrong. You dont want that, so you stay away from others, which in turn makes you even more distant.

By the time you've realized that the cape was cursed, it's already too late. It has become a part of you. It's wrapped around you, around your true self. You are still somewhere inside, but around your true self is that vast cloak of nothing that keeps any feeling, no matter if good or bad out. You've worn the cape for so long that you have forgotten how it feels... to feel.

When you go to your allies and ask for help they dont see what the cape has done to you. They only see the old wounds and think you must be in pain. They cast their healing spells on you, but they pass right through you. However all they see is that those old wounds just wont heal, so they get frustrated and give up. It's just you and the cape.""

EDIT 2: Oh, and I while this was not in my original explanation, I feel that this should definately be in.

""...though some of the worst days are those when the cape randomly shifts your alignment to neutral evil. Suddenly you can feel again, but the cape allows you only one single feeling: Anger. You're angry at the cape for having so much power over you, you're angry at yourself for letting it happen and you're angry at your enemies and allies alike. You start to remember every single time insult and injury, from the small goblin that threw rocks at you all the way up to the lich sending wave after wave of mindless undead after you. You remember every single time your tank failed to protect you, every single healing spell cast just a second too late. Suddenly you're the fickle god again, looking down on the masses with a smile of disdain on your face. For a moment you're glad. You feel. And then the next day it's over. The cape has worked its curse again, only to leave you ashamed and guilty for being cruel to your allies and vindictive towards your enemies. But fear not, the cape is still there, wrapping you in nothing that protects you from nothing."""
ij3ko2,depression,Did your anxiety give you depression or am I just fucked.,"My anxiety makes me care too much until I don’t care at all and I fluctuate between the two. How can I stop this? Depression is quickly starting to win the battle against me😶

Any advice or coping mechanisms?"
eophbs,depression,I can’t stand it anymore. I’m committing suicide. This is my story. Being good and positive won’t help u stop suffering.,"Why does this happen to me.

Honest to god I hate my life so much. I’m a 16 year boy.I try to make every negative thing positive but it doesn’t works. So much has happen to me in the last year. My parents and sister passed away in an accident last year, I don’t if I should feel bad since they’ve tortured me mentally and physically my whole life. I never though much of it. But once my uncle raped me at 6, and told me to shut up or he’ll kill me. When I came of age I found out the truth. I revealed it to. My parents, who tried to get me arrested for being mentally ill. Just because they wanted to save face. But what has happened happened . I escaped the morning after they found out and tortured me to shut up(same night they tried to get me arrested). I escaped and entered foster care when I was 13/14 .I’m in my last year in high school. I have my gcse and I can’t study with due to the time limit my carer has given me and it just doesn’t work because the house is far from my school so it takes long to travel. I travel for 4 hours(mostly walking)(it’s 7.4 miles, however I take multiple bus routes and walk for an hour).4 hours there and back. So that meant I had 8 hours to sleep or study.So I barely get any chance to revise. Especially since I know I’m smart (I got straight 7s ‘A’ in my mocks before this unfolded). So it’s so frustrating since I didn’t do too well in my last mock, due to my parents death a few days before my 2nd mocks started, now I’m struggling to stay in my high sets. Then there’s my social life. As I said it’s hard to do anything since I live far my original town (around an hour away). Side track- I used to be really overweight but due me being bullied as a kid and then my crush making fun of Me, motivated me to lose weight, age 13(85kg) to age 14(51kg) which I was proud off. But that routine got destroyed due to me moving into foster. I gained weight and now I’m age 15, 2 months away from 16. (65kg). And one thing that annoys me is that my aunty could’ve taken my. She had a high paying job, but she didn’t want to take care of ‘kid’ ( she’s married and has a child). She was also a social worker. However I forgot to mention. It was this women, this women who I confided in. Someone I though was my hope. She was the one that betrayed me and told my parents about my uncle raping me and me wanting to move out when I turn 18. She betrayed me and made it seems as though I fabricated this lie so I could move out. She promised me to wait till I turned 18 so I had a choice in my life. But nope she couldn’t wait. First of all. I wasn’t the only one raped. 2 other kids were also raped by him. They both told my aunty. But to save face. They threatened the other two. Because they’re still 11. They’re more likely to listen. I didn’t. Therefore the reason I was tortured. I hate her with all my life. My only hope turned into my biggest disappointment. (Police gave up due to the lack of testimony, whole family conspired against me) In addition to my social life. As I mention I was bullied my whole childhood. I was a fat kid who didn’t know how to socialise. Becuz my parents always fought or let their frustration out on me. Mentally or physically. And because I wasn’t ‘popular’ , my ‘best friend’ pretended not to know me in school and then supposedly wants to always hang out with me when ever there wasn’t school. I was still naive then. He betrayed me twice in high school. I ended our friendship 2 years ago after the 2nd time I trusted him and he betrayed me. A few weeks after that I met a new person who was a really good friend. That was when his cousin wasn’t around. His cousin lied framed me racist comment(weird even though we’re the same race, but still I didn’t even say it, I proved it a week later when he posted the wrong screenshot since we had beef showing he said it first and all I did was say the same thing back).and what my friend did was support him. That infuriated me since I knew he was supporting him and sat next thing.what makes it even worse was that it was all on his phone. I didn’t end my friendship with this person, but I did drift off from him. I then met a person who was a genuine nice person. We had a good couple of months. But his parents were strict so we couldn’t hang out much and we’ve kinda drifted off but he is still someone I would trust. I also met another genuine person. He was a new kid. And he is now my best friend, I think. It was weird because I never expected it to happen since he was popular I was just well a student.. even we’re close and talk quiet a bit. But I always feel uncomfortable with him, he never answers me with full sentences, doesn’t talk to me when we’re with out group of friends. But I do know he cares for me as a friend. But a lot of the time I think that if it was purely up to him and by date of chance that we say next to each other. Is that he never would’ve bothered speaking to me. In fact he’s probably the only one that would actually hang out with me in our group of friends. The thing our group of friends aren’t like friend but just nice people in my perspective.its like we’re friends only when the other person is here( if u get what I mean). It honestly is so fucked up me. I only have. What like a month to my gcse and all I. Am is depressed, down, I have never once been happy this year. Actually that was a life. The only thing that makes me happy is anime. I’ve developed an anime addiction ever since age 8. This was originally due to my parents fighting and arguing so I went upstairs to watch movies until I stumbled onto anime. The only good thing I can think of is that in 2 mo the I turn 16 which means I’ll be able to rent a flat thanks to my social workers. I’ll be in a new town (in a new school( I’ll be in college) and I’ll be able to start a fresh start. But still looking how my life is. It feels like I’m meant to have a hard life. It doesn’t help that I’m an atheist because that means I’m not able to rely on someone with 100% belief. I’ve never had a true true friend, my education is pretty much ruin, I’m literally on my own( my carer only cares about the money and my social worker can’t find any more placements). It’s so fucking frustrating. Honestly is it just that some people have a hard life. I’ve sacrificed so many hours of sleep that my heights been affected and that I’ve dozed of many time on the bus.i just can’t care anymore. All I want now is to become rich and take over the world. Without Any selfish desires, I just want to truly make this world better. Because it doesn’t look like anyone is gonna help me. I’ve tried, got hurt...many times and all for what.



Edit: half a year later into now January 2020(in my first year of college). My life has gone worse. I’m not in the mood to explain it. somehow, somehow it’s gone worse. Ive been diagnosed with metal health disorder. And no one understands me. They have bad view of me. And when I try to explain. They place their authority over me and won’t let me talk. Especially when I have facts. My social life hasn’t changed. My genuine friend with strict parents. Guess what happened. You would have never would’ve guessed🙄he spread rumours about my personal life and left me for another person. I’ve gained weight. I’m back to my weight before my weight loss. I’m now again 85kg. I didn’t get into the course I wanted in college becuz I was a grade behind. The works easy, but I can’t seems to concentrate. I zone out when the teacher scolds. Even though I really do want to listen. I do want to try. I’ve been having mental breakdowns pretty much everyday.I’ve been debating over the last few months to either take the drug and deep it’s effect. Even though my studies will fail more than it already has or overdose and commit suicide. I’m lost. I’m hopeless. I’ve got no one for me. I’m no one number one. I’m alone. I got literally nothing  to lose. And no one benefits from me being alive. It I’ve had enough of this bullshit life in this bullshit world. I have bad luck. There’s no desputing that. It is what it is. I’m committing the act on my birthday which is in June.. to a certain extent. This is kinda funny. Who would’ve though life could get this shitty at such a young age for kid born in a good area. Who would’ve though, not trying to sound pessimistic but I was genuinely kind and generous to all my friends and everyone I meet would suffer like this. The good guy gets nothing. Wow even I cringed when I said that. Whatever happens in June happens. If I do commit. I’d at least want someone to know my story. And if they meet someone like me. Please I beg with all my life, help him. The one thing I wish I had. Was someone who understood. Someone who didn’t listen because they had but they wanted to. Someone who wouldn’t try to tell me to look at the positive but actually help.  Someone who would’ve been my hero. Thank you for reading. This is KU/KW(before I changed my name and after initials) 14/6/2020✌️


Sorry I should’ve mentioned it. I’m in my second half on year 13. College.  I failed my GCSE. I didn’t get enough sleep. I ran away during one exam and all the others I couldn’t concentrate.

3vce1n,depression,"So I have this virus ""depression.exe"" on my computer...","About a year ago I realized my computer was running slower than usual-of course this took me a few weeks to realize since the decrease in performance was gradual. Once I realized, I opened the process tab and find this program ""depression.exe"" running, hogging a lot of my CPU. I'm fairly sure it's a virus, but the weirdest thing is that I haven’t been downloading anything that would contain a virus… and as far as I can tell it doesn't even have a function! Its only purpose is to hog CPU and make it more difficult to perform basic functions.

So anyway I try closing it, but nothing happens. I try again until Windows gives me the typical “depression.exe is not responding”. Obviously I click “close now” and wait a bit, but still nothing happens. I keep clicking everywhere and mashing buttons to end the program (PSA this is an awful idea… trying to do too much will only overload your computer) but my desktop only freezes. Oh well I say, I’ll just restart the computer and hope that tomorrow I’ll have more success in getting rid of the virus.

The next week or so I keep mashing buttons and hitting “end now”, but again this only overloads my computer and forces me to shut down for the day. Meanwhile the virus has been getting greedier and is taking up more and more of my CPU. Programs run slower, and I experience more stutters and lags in processing. Eventually I gave up trying to end depression.exe by conventional means, and sought antivirus software.

The software was a bit of a pain to install at first and costed a chunk of change, and unfortunately did no good. Sure, it was able to detect the virus (it turns out that it’s not so uncommon), but was useless in actually removing it. I had the same experiences with other antivirus software: not powerful enough, didn’t detect the problem, misidentified the virus… the list goes on. I still try to run antivirus software once a week just in case, but most of the time it just uses up even *more* CPU.

Some other users try to help, but it’s obvious they never had this malware. “Have you tried turning it on and off again?” “Sometimes when my computer is overloaded, I just need to delete a lot of processes for a bit”, or “It’ll run quickly again, you’ll see”. They don’t understand just how terrible depression.exe is.

It’s difficult because I rely on this computer for school, work, you name it. When I first had the virus it wasn’t too difficult to still carry out my responsibilities, but since the virus has grown, it’s become *much* more difficult. Some days the computer won’t even boot up. I miss assignments and fall behind, all because of this awful virus. I see others whose computers run just fine and wonder what I did to get this virus, and how my computer is just so different compared to theirs when we have the same model. 

Some days, I just want to scrap my computer. Even though I can’t afford a new one.

I listen to music a lot. It takes me somewhere. I just wish some songs were longer. 
I take codeine to numb myself quite often. I get a prescription every now and then, as I have a condition which leaves me sore nearly all the time. Haha. Life's a cunt. 

I can't cry. I need to. I feel it nearly everyday. Being right on the brink of tears. But there's nothing there. 

I don't know how it's possible to feel so emotionally empty and numb but at the same time feel EVERYTHING. EVERY FUCKING THING. I can't breathe sometimes because of just how real it becomes.

And yet if you were to look at me, you would see the most blank, dull empty stare. I'm nothing. And yet my mind tries to be everything haha. Such a broken piece of shit.

My fitness has gone right back downhill, and I can't even get myself to do any basic exercise. The person I gave my heart to is still out there, doing...whatever she is doing in Colorado. All of my plans for this year have been steadily getting cancelled. I still live in a shithole area of the world, and have thought every single day about where I'd like to move to in order to escape this hell. And today I ran into the girl I saw months ago, and hoped to see again...and I couldn't even get myself to say hello.

This isn't the end of the world...but it feels so much like it. And I find myself wanting it to be the end. I didn't want much out of life, and I didn't get it..."

1hfqib,depression,What depression isn't.,"Depression isn't an emotion. Depression has no cause. Too often is depression conflated with sadness or anxiety. I came out to my boss over my depression a while ago, and though he is one of the most kind and understanding people I know, he won't mention it. He sometimes asks me how my anxiety is doing.

Depression, when it is present, is more like the force of gravity. It is there, pulling down on you under all circumstances. Though I'm depressed I am often very happy- but still there is the unfeeling wet blanket of muddled confusion and writhing frustration seething under it all. Waiting.

A creeping numbness that insidiously degrades and diminishes every aspect of conscious life. A storm of screaming and hatred in dreams. A dull apathy in waking. A sinking stomach in the face of joy and a faithless lassitude in the face of hope. 

Depression isn't an emotion. Depression is a contradiction to every worthy aspect of life."

881x8r,depression,My girlfriend died and I don't know how to go on...,"She had cancer and was 27.. We've been together for 9 years and were going to marry in a couple of years.. We had lived for 2 years by now and everything was going perfectly.. maybe too much.. We were faithful, devoted to each other. She was my oxygen, I was hers. She was my first and truly love.

I feel kinda depressed and alone.. We had no many friends, so that just the two of us was enough for the most part of our lives.. I'll leave for our house next week, since I've been with my family so far.. I'm joining my old job again, but this time, no one will wait for me at home, my salary will be just for me, and all that mattered now it doesn't..  I've got no reasons to keep on living.

lc5nsw,depression,i don’t feel like i’m suicidal “enough” to warrant help but at the same time...,"...every time i *do* feel suicidal it hits me like a ton of fucking bricks. like right now. my heart is telling me to go jump off the fire escape. the scene keeps replaying in my head while i lie in bed motionless and numb. 

i feel like a fake depressed person because i avoid my responsibilities and just play video games or do anything meaningless to fill time. it just makes me feel like a lazy person and i often think i’m just using my depression as an excuse to feel lazy and that i deserve the suicidal thoughts. 

i want to admit myself to inpatient but again, i feel like i’d just be taking up space as a fake depressed person. even though sometimes i really can’t stop thinking or fantasizing about killing myself. i just don’t want to experience the stress of school anymore. i lost all my friends. i’m also scared of leaving my partner to fend for themselves. and i don’t know if my school would even permit a leave of absence anyways. also covid, of course. every time i think about or try to do homework, my brain goes into suicide mode. even though i love learning and what i learn about. i’m so far behind in my classes. because maybe i’m just lazy and not actually depressed.

i don’t know it’s not like anyone will see this i just need to talk about it. i feel so nauseous.

small edit: i went to sleep last night and am only now checking reddit after class and i.. i’m so blown away by the supportive responses and the support offers i’ve gotten. when i said i thought no one would see this i genuinely meant it and so to be able to read everyone’s comments, even the ones of people who are in the same spot, it has given me more hope. i feel so warm and fuzzy inside. i felt i had lost all my friends to my depression and i haven’t felt this feeling in my chest in a while, and i can’t overstate how flattered i am, i would cry if i could. i’m gonna try to reply to people. you all really helped me last night and today. 

i woke up and it’s a bright, sunny day. i can hear the cars and the people outside. i’m still sad and unstable but i feel hope in my chest. so thank you. really. 🤍"
bjhmyu,depression,Does anyone make drafts and ends up not posting?,"I have a ridiculous amount of drafts here talking about how I feel. I don’t know why. Maybe I just want the support of others who possibly feel the same or I’m embarrassed. I feel like I can’t go to my friends or family to talk about it. My family would immediately send me to a psych ward (I tried to OD a few years back and was locked up). My friends would call me dramatic. 

So, I guess this is my stepping stone to post here.

Edit: Wow it’s kind of relieving to see that everyone feels the same. But hey, let’s support each other?"
40p561,depression,"Depression: The disease that makes you isolate yourself from your friends, and then helps you be extra miserable later when your friends do things without you.","Thanks, depression. I *knew* isolating myself and pushing everyone away was unhealthy and unhelpful, and yet I did it anyway because I felt I didn't have a choice. Now that I put myself in this position, even my small group of friends that ""understand what I'm dealing with"" or know what's going on have stopped inviting me to things entirely, and I know it's really not their fault, but it still hurts when I see the pictures or hear about it in passing. I know I can't expect people to still invite me to things when I always decline, especially now when the days that I feel up to being around other people are few and far between. The (anti)social aspect of depression is such a hard cycle to break out of. "

bzufco,depression,"""You're a goner"" - my therapist lol","During therapy yesterday, the topic of my past experiences with therapists came up. My therapist asked how many I'd seen in the past.

Me: ""8, 3 of them in the past few years.""

Her: ""Ohhh..you're a goner. Whenever I hear that from people - seen that many therapists - I feel like they're a goner."" 

Her: ...proceeds to sorta walk this back.... ""I'm pessimistic, but optimistic too."" 

It was kinda funny. I mean damn I agree with her, chances are I'm a fucking goner and there's no hope, but aren't you supposed to help be building my optimism and hope? If I wanted to hear that there's no hope for me, I'd just re-read literally any of my journal entries from the past 3-4 years. 

I could't help but laugh about it later though."
8kijh5,depression,Have you ever felt so sad that you actually feel a sharp sore pain in your heart?,I feel so stupid. And so worthless.

I don’t want to end it all, but i don’t care if i live or die.","I can almost feel pain and numbness creeping into me sometimes, but it just goes away as soon as it came.  I honestly don’t even know what i want anymore."
lsb7t3,depression,I don't enjoy being... human,"Also I'm not intrested in jumping into the void (death) either. I'm scared of non-existence. I want to live or... I just want to exist. Observe. Not participating in the world, just watching people from ghost-like perspective. I don't like doing stuff. I just want to watch, or swim in the ocean of warmth untill I'll get better.

I'm poor, always have been, no rich parents. My parents are poor and abusive. Never went to college, but it's not a big deal for anyone (I hate myself for that, but I've been too depressed to study anything, also I failed my finals and I only have hs degree).  I've been struggling with anxiety and depression since I was 12. I'm 22 now. I had a really f up childhood and adolescence, so much traumatic experience, I can't even count them all. Extreme poverty, loneliness, lack of friends etc. Six years spent in theraphy for nothing, at least we've got free healthcare, lol. Talking about obvious things is not for me I guess. I was a patient on a mental ward also - no one could help me. Meds - same, and I've tried too many. I just don't like being human, it's not for me. And there is no escape from it. There is death or... this life. 

For me, the only way to stop being poor is to work my ass off at some low-income job and saving some money. And then what? Considering, that I don't even have power to work so much. I'm not from US, I know that things are different there. I'm too exhausted to work and I don't see the point. I even skipped work today first time in months. I dont' have the power to educate myself anymore. 

You see, human life is... boring. And these parts of life that are considered not boring are really expensive or not that cool after all. I'm intrested in supernatural (even tho I don't believe in this kind of stuff) since I was a child because being human truly sucks. Working, working, working. Eating, fucked up boring activities, working, mundane job.  And even these things that I like... I don't see the point in doing them. I used to like writing in my native language, but right now my head is like made of cement. Brain fog, being exhausted, lack of imagination. Years of stress and anxiety gave me a brain damage. Damn, I don't know even how to write this stuff without mistakes, even tho I understand English perfectly. I have no plans for my life, I won't ever get a degree, in my country if you're not working as an IT expert or a private doctor or a lawyer you earn nothing. I've got OCD, depression and various anxiety-related stuff.  In my country there is a cult of working your ass off.  If you're not doing it, then you're a loser and a lazy mother\*\*\*\*r and you deserve nothing. Also, you're poor.

Everything I like, even when I was a child, from music to movies, is about supernatural. About hazy dream state or abstract or surreal stuff. Demonic possesions, vampires, being trapped in a dream, dying and hallucinating - some of my favourite movies. I don't like life. I don't like being human. And I guess I'll never like it. No one will help me, I can only count on myself - and I'm too tired to do that. 

My body is failing, my back is twisted, I look like shit. I can't fix my skeleton. I hate my face. I hate human life, I don't enjoy human activites, even pleasant ones. I know it's depression, but it's also something deeper. Since I was born I felt that something is wrong, that I shouldn't be alive. That I shouldn't be human. If there is life after death, I'm gonna be so proud of myself that I survived (even tho I died, lol). 

I don't have plans for my life, because I'm broke, alone and without future. There is no future for someone who doesn't work, work, work, work That's reallity. So, I'm just gonna exist a bit longer, and then: who knows? Climate change? Suicide? War? Nothing? Just same ol' bs? 

I'm so lonely. I've got my bf, but he... He's not really into helping me, he's got his own problems and traumas. 

I'm trapped. I don't want to die. I don't want to live. Theraphy is not working, never worked for me I KNOW why I feel like that, meds are not working, my reallity is crushing me. It's all so boring, so... sad. It's not just how my life works, any other scenarios are completely impossible or just not exciting at all.     


I just hate being human. Sorry for my English, blah blah, I hope you'll understand everything."

Did you ever get in your car and thought: Huh, maybe this time I will die? And feel almost disappointed you haven't finished in a car crash?  
Have you ever crossed the road and almost got hit by a car and was like: Damn, it was close!

Started to cut vegetables, and thought about hurting yourself?  
Hang yourself? Fall off a bridge? 

There are honestly thousands of ways I could have ended my life, for many horrible reasons, my own demons eating me, my own anxiety taking the best of me and my depression taking away my self worth.  I feel like shit and like I don't deserve a place here and my loved ones deserve better. I am lost. I am alone. I feel horribly... horribly numb.

That's most people.... on the internet there are a lot of depressed folk like myself so it starts to feel normal. But it's not. And that's crazy to me.


In the last 2 years, not a single day went by without me wanting to kill myself, genuinely. For a long time the moment I wake up I feel... dread? No reason at all I can suddenly cry while doing things like exercising. Sometimes I can't cry at all. For the whole of today I've been on my bed, occasional tears but no crying, falling asleep and waking up feeling the worst. I have things to do ffs..."

wonder how many pills it will take to die ?.

Taake a breath and try to think straight. 
Come on drugs ,I don’t know how much longer I can wait ?!.

The morning light is so far away .
I use my metal saviour to keep demons at bay. 

So please tell me you love me ,even if it’s fake .
And fingers crossed ,tomorrow I won’t wake .

As night turns to day my world will shatter. 
Why was I sobbing all night , does it matter ? . 

I won’t let you not loving me ,Determine who I grow up to be . 
when you left you said it was us ,but it turns out it’s just me .

So you keep shoving these meds down my throat and I will keep reading motivational quotes.
maybe then in the summer I can wear tank tops and not coats .

I’m going to sharpen my teeth on every rock you throw.

e0k42b,depression,Unemployed Therapist,"I’m a therapist- but recently lost my job to my depression. It was a personal choice, but I felt that everyone I worked with wanted me to leave. I have severe issues with self-doubt. I feel like a fraud, like my MSEd is not legit, I didn’t deserve to graduate magna cum laude.

My family is financially supportive when I need them but not much else. My mom just tells me to take my meds (I do), or she offers me her meds. I told my sister earlier this year that I was feeling suicidal and she basically said, “between you and my cheating husband I’m going to go insane!”

My own husband is patient but not very supportive. I’ve been on the couch since Monday and he has been operating as normal, working, going into the office, never stopping to ask how I am. I know he wants me to return to “normal”. I worry he’ll give up on me.

I interviewed for another job last week and this week. It was an adoption counselor position, something I’ve always dreamt of. I did both interviews disguising my severely depressed state with smiles and makeup. I didn’t get the job. 

While still working, I found a therapist- in hopes of getting the support I needed to keep working and to be a good therapist myself. I made the mistake of telling her that I smoke weed sometimes. She then began questioning my work and my physical health. She also felt my main goal should be to get off meds (40 mg Prozac), as I was somehow “putting my health at risk”. Needless to say, I plummeting deeper into depression.

I spoke to my PCP and he prescribed me an antipsychotic. After two days, I was so sick I had to stop the new meds and see my doctor again. When I asked to try something different, he told me “pills aren’t going to make you happy.”

I guess I feel hopeless and alone. I have two little boys who are 3 and 6. My oldest son has severe special needs. I am able to take care of them, but I cannot get off the couch to do anything else. My body hurts, I can’t eat anything. My husband and kids went to breakfast and I stayed home to watch TV in my pajamas.

I feel a bit like I’m already dead, and that nobody cares enough about me to try and help me."

6pgoal,depression,Attempted suicide last night. Now I'm being guarded 24/7 by police officers.,"So last night I got desperate and attempted suicide in the most stupid way. I took a bunch of pills with a lot of vodka. I would have chosen something more effective if I had thought about it more and I'm so mad at myself right now. I had the chance to die and I ruined it by saying goodbye to my friends who then proceeded to call the paramedics on me. I refused to go with them so then I got fucking detained and handcuffs. Cos the best way to deal with suicidal people is to fucking treat them like criminals 👍
Currently being guarded around the clock by police officers. Luckily they've all been really nice but this fucking sucks. I wish I'd been less stupid and less of a pussy. Pills are not worth it man. Probably fucked my liver up for life. 

Oh and only one person has visited me. A friend. None of my family have so much as messaged me to see if I'm okay. I'm also being told people are fucking angry at me for worrying them so much. How fucking dare they! I'm going through some of the worst shit in my life and they only care about their own feelings. I fucking hate how suicidal people are treated in this world.

Sorry for the rant, maybe someone here can relate.


Update:
I'm so overwhelmed by how lovely you have all been. I knew this community was amazing already but I've never made an actual post before (I'm using a alt account so when I shitpost people can't see all my private life to this extent) 
You are all awesome humans and I wish you all the best with your battle with this terrible illness.

So update on me if anyone is reading, I was moved to a secure unit 2 hours away from my home city to be assessed. They've deemed me fit to leave (NHS is very underfunded, I repeatedly told them I'm probably gonna attempt again but they still cleared me) but none of my family or friends are able to take me in yet (I needed a 'safe space')
I met the most lovely psychiatrist who arranged for me to stay in a B&B for the night in the lovely city of Salisbury  (For Americans/not Brits this is near to Stonehenge)
He was beyond amazing. It's not usual for people to get a B&B but I was so distressed at the thought of staying on that ward another night he arranged it all. He even drove me here, gave me a massive hug and told me I was lovely. Don't think I'll ever forget his kindness. 

I'm doing okay, of course I still have near constant suicidal thoughts but I've resolved to give life another try at least for the next few days. 


Thank you all for your comments and love <3

5f5hea,depression,Anyone else feels like they would actually be someone if they were not held back by psychological problems?,"Like seriously mabye i would actually succed relatively in my studies, actually have a couple of friends i could hold on to, actually have something worth living for, if it was not for all the shit you get from staying inside and stacking up a shit ton of problems in your head.
At the same time i would be happy just having one good friend, living a mediocre life, aint nothing wrong with that it's just you keep hindering yourself with all the crap pentup in your head.
When i point this out i'm sure a lot of you guys/gals can sympathize with this difficulty when it comes to social interaction, it's so goddamn hard, unless i'm speaking to my family/a nice psychologist, i seriously can't keep the act together, i become this shell of a person not knowing what to do, and feel.
Not being able to feel like a real person and not knowing what kinda person you are yourself really hinders anything you do whether it's just in your head or whatever it's very real for us.
I think us in particular are the worlds most untapped resources, i hope everybody in the world will someday find a cure to this utter paralysing state, that is depression in combination with the extra package which comes for free (Yay free shit.)



Edit: It's always nice to know you are not alone, so for that i am grateful, but the fact that a lot of people feels similar/the same as me makes me really sad, it's a terrible state of being and i really wish the best for you guys out there, I really think someday this hurdle will become a walk in the park, and all of us will achieve that which we want :)."

As a teen I was in a serious relationship with a guy (now M23) once, were 2.5 years together but I finally broke up with him 6 years ago since he belittled me, put me down constantly, used to laugh at me crying (which I did every day at the end), be annoyed when I needed help (I have endometriosis, severe phobia and sometimes I get panic attacks if the phobia triggers me) and so on. (I know a relationship couldnt really be serious since I was 17 but the long term damage it did is definitely serious). Guy was also a legit genius and I still have to hear about his new papers or something from mutual acquaintances. 
Since than, I haven’t really been dating, I’ve tried tinder numerous times but since I always only swipe right on guys I don’t feel threatened by, I usually don’t get past the first date (if at all) because I can’t bring myself to write back. I am conflicted, since as you can see, I’m the whole “won the health lottery and also I’m miserable” package and I don’t want to put this on anyone. I also have next to none sexual experience and no sex drive since I’ve started taking antidepressants. Still, I’m just lonely.
(I think it’s also important for you to know that I’m working to be a professional in a medical field and my program takes long hours and  is extremely hard and stressful, which doesn’t really help. I have 2 more years to go.)

So my question to you guys is : was someone here in a similar situation? How did you get out? I’ve been single for over 6 years now and I desperately want someone to connect with but no matter how hard I try I can’t really get out of my small lonely bubble and I know I don’t have much to offer. There is definitely more than enough guys who would want me for my body but that’s not an arrangement I’d personally be comfortable with right now. I don’t know what to do but I’m getting more and more frustrated and sad by the day, and that’s been going on for at least 2 years now. 

Sorry for the long post and thanks for reading if you’ve gotten this far!"

byjnm7,depression,People wonder why depressed or suicidal people don’t get help,"When I was four years old, my family was going to leave our country to live in the United States. They abandoned everything so my brother and I could live a good life. How am I supposed to tell the people to gave up everything, worked every single day, learned an entire language through just talking to others, and moved away from their loved ones for me to have a good life, that I don’t even want my life anymore? How am I supposed to tell them I don’t want to live the life they wanted for me anymore? How am I supposed to tell them that? It would break their heart. It would break everyone’s heart. 

I can’t do that to them."
awewhm,depression,"Today my depression won, I dropped out of college","My depression won today, I couldn’t keep going as I was. I thought I could handle it, I really did. I was excited to study my major, but I couldn’t handle it. I started missing classes, forgetting to take proper care of myself. My room became a mess, and so did my grades.

My parents are coming down tomorrow to pack my things up and bring me home, they’re going to get me the help I need, going to keep me under their supervision. I feel guilty as hell for wasting so much money and time for college when I knew I could never handle it with the way things are. My heart feels like it’s in my throat, my head feels like it’s stuffed with cotton. 

I’m going to have to quit my job and find a new one once I get home. At least I’ll try to find something to keep me sociable and busy during the day. "

8t7rjv,depression,"If someones willing to read this, itd make my night.","Coming from an already broken heart:
Okay, so. Yesterday was prom. I care about the girl i went with so much and were kind of talking too. she knows i deal with anxiety depression insomnia and some other shit. anyway. everyone got up at prom and started dancing. this freaked me the fuck out dor whatever reason. i really really felt like i was going to break down so i went outside and walked around. turns out i didnt have the willpower to go back inside with everyone dancing and shit. i was out there for 3 hours by myself, and the occasional teacher coming out to check on me which made me feel even worse. eventually i went back in just because i felt so fucking bad for not dancing with her and i just hung out with her on the dance floor. eventually prom ended, she was happy , and i wasnt. We went to afterprom and were sitting down together on a bench. i end up getting so tired im literally falling asleep. she reaches over and puts her arm around my waist and kissed by head and like rubbed me in an affectionate way. i looked at her and i hugged her so hard because thats literally one of the nicest things anyone has ever done me and one of the happiest moments of my life. prom is over now and i havent heard from her since and its making me super sad, and i know i only have 2 more months with her bc of college... i really dont know why this makes me so upset but it seriously does

Edit: Holy fuck this blew up. For anyone asking, i did text her yesterday. She didnt open my text and still hasnt this morning. Kind of confused.

Update: She is super busy and i will hear back from her tonight."

It’s okay though... I won’t be here much longer. I’m just sort of confused on how to tell everyone and how it will feel to hang myself. I don’t know... I’m scared. But it’s much better than living. I will tell all my friends goodbye soon anyways... I think everyone will be able to get through it. It’s not that big of a deal when you really think about the bad person I am. I know I said it a million times but for real this time. I’m ready to do it. I’ve been broken a lot, but this time I can feel that it’s the last thing to break. Usually I’m open to compassion from others but not this time. I feel fixed on dying and I don’t want help. I don’t care anymore really. I don’t want to talk about it anymore or make any online friends anymore or anything fucking thing. I realized I have to do it. I knew for a while it was my destiny but I was too scared to do it. But it’s better to die now then suffer from suicidal thinking for 10-20 years and just feel even more worse things. If I can’t handle this what can I handle.... and to everyone that was mean to me or is just a piece of shit I hate them so much . I jsut have so much hate. I’d really like to hurt myself

Edit: I’m trying to reply to everyone but it’s a lot. Sorry if I don’t reply to you. I appreciate the comments though.

1ywyvt,depression,"If you get a PM from someone claiming that religion with cure your depression, please click ""report"" and then ignore it!","It appears that someone is indiscriminately messaging people and trying to ""save"" them after they've posted here.  Unfortunately, none of the measures available to us as subreddit moderators has any effect on the ability to send PMs, but if you click ""report"" it will bring this behaviour to the attention of the reddit admins.

We'd like to take this opportunity to remind you that we think it's a very bad idea to trust anyone who tries to take ""supportive"" conversations to PM right away.  The only reasons we can think of why someone would do this are:

 * They know that whatever they're offering is against the rules, or in some other way won't stand up to scrutiny by the community.

 * They have a non-supportive and possibly sinister agenda, and they're preying on your because they think they can fool you when you're vulnerable.

If you're here to help, please respond and establish a rapport *in the sub* where the whole community can contribute to the discussion.  We all get more out of it that way.  

**Edit:**  The above comments apply *only* to people offering/giving help and support.  We completely understand that there may be excellent reasons why a person *requesting* help may only want to discuss their issues privately.  In those situations, having helpers' comment history available can still be very helpful in identifying people to approach.

6swsuk,depression,"Regular Check-In, and some info about high-risk posts.","Welcome to the (ir)regular check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.

We try our best to keep this space as safe and supportive as possible on reddit's wide-open anonymity-friendly platform. The community rules can be found in the sidebar.

This time I want to share some points about helping OPs who may be at risk for suicide.  

* Although we understand that depression and suicidality are distinct issues and we encourage people whose main issue is suicidal thoughts and feelings to post at /r/SuicideWatch, we don't feel that *any* kind of ""you should post there, not here"" message could conceivably be helpful to a person in great distress.  However, the information in [the SW sidebar](/r/SuicideWatch/about/sidebar) may be of help to anyone trying to support someone struggling with thoughts of suicide.  We link the two most important posts for helpers, the talking tips and risk assessment guide, from the sidebar here, but there's a lot more there.  

* Almost nobody posts about their suicidal thoughts on reddit because they don't know that hotlines exist.  Just providing a hotline number without finding out how the person might feel about that option can make the person feel invalidated.  Also, if it does make sense to suggest a hotline in a particular case, don't just assume a person's in the US. Imagine the how it would feel for a US redditor to be told ""just call 116 123, that'll work everywhere"" meaning everywhere in the European Union. There's a global directory in the /r/SuicideWatch sidebar, which is also linked here, and that's the best link to offer someone whose location you don't know.  

* Remember that anonymity is a safety device in suicide intervention that saves far more lives than it costs.  The situations where breaching someone's confidentiality is the best option are the outliers, like when someone is strangled by a safety harness. Plus, we almost never have enough risk assessment information to justify outing someone (which has to go through reddit's admins and their legal team) and subjecting them to a traumatic, invasive, involuntary intervention, which may discourage them from opening up about their feelings in future.  

* If you do feel that a post needs attention from the mod team for any reason, including high risk of harm, please take a few extra seconds to send us a modmail rather than clicking ""report"".  The linkage between reports and spam is hardcoded into reddit's DNA, so clicking ""report"" on a post increases the risk that the post will be snagged by the sitewide filter, which we have no control over.  

* Keep in mind that the most reliable way to de-escalate someone is to give them the experience of feeling understood.  A strong interpersonal connection is usually enough to reduce immediate risk of suicide. That's one of the many reasons why [this little empathy video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Evwgu369Jw) is always linked from our sidebar. "

And as you look back to where you fell from -the only way out- you  see it receding further and further into the distance, the light becoming dimmer and smaller while the hole in which you are falling becomes deeper, darker, and tighter. The light above you eventually disappears and leaves you in complete darkness. You can only look down, towards the end, hoping it will come soon."

e1u1c2,depression,Can you be suicidal but be scared to die?,"I think about dying a lot. I think about the affect it would have and what would happen to the very few people who care about me. Sometimes I wish everything would stop and I could just be gone. 
But I’m terrified of death, I think it’s my anxiety taking over.

I just have this endogenous, chemical depression that's as bad as being in physical pain. I've been on so many meds in the past and they don't seem to work for me anymore. I run distance every single day and eat well.

dsvqrz,depression,It’s 5am I Have Not Slept and I Am Spiraling,"EDIT: *obligatory “wow this blew up* I found this subreddit in early hours of the morning, very anxious and upset about life in general. I don’t even know if I’m using it right haha. But I wanna say thank you to everyone who has sent kind words or even just a “damn me too” because it really helps knowing I’m not alone in my feelings.
I am currently seeing a therapist. He is great I’ve been going to him for a while, but unfortunately it’s a little hard for me to see him because he’s at my university’s counseling center and he’s pretty much always booked.
I so appreciate the advice on the student disabilities and medical leave. It’s definitely something I’m going to look into, and it wasn’t anything I was aware of until now, so thank you for mentioning it!
Someone suggested I wasn’t going to class just because. I feel like for clarification’s sake I should mention the reason I haven’t been is because I got very sick (I know these absences are excused) and that on top of getting used to new depression meds made it difficult. I live about 20 minutes away from campus, so it’s not like I can just run out of my dorm into my class haha.



I don’t know really know where else to go or how to format this so I guess I’ll just bullet point Why My Life Is Extra Shitty Right Now:

• College is kicking my ass right now. I haven’t been to class in like 3 weeks 1) what’s the point in going anymore I am so far behind by now and 2) I don’t even want to be in college right now and it’s taken me a year and a half to really realize I only went because I felt pressured to by peers and family. I want to drop out so badly, because I know I’m just not in the headspace to do it right now, but my family expects a lot out of me because I was “smart” in high school and I don’t want them all to hate me and also I will lose a pretty big scholarship if I quit going and shakdnhdiebd (not to mention NO ONE ELSE MY AGE is having any problems with this, just me which makes me feel 50x worse about the whole thing. like I have friends taking 18 hours this semester and I’m so behind and I’m only doing 13 haha what a LOSER amrite)

• I found out last week that I’m losing my job. I work retail and yeah I could find another job easy, but I was planning on being there for at least my undergrad and for some reason the store I work at being shut down threw a huge fucking wrench in my life plan. Not to mention it’s almost holiday season, I don’t want to be the newbie at a new job when it’s already gonna be hectic and I love the place I work at right now and I’m just sad in general it’s gonna be gone

• I started taking antidepressants about a month ago and sometimes I feel fine but mostly I’m just exhausted and can’t wake up until the late hours of the afternoon, which REALLY doesn’t help my whole not going to class thing
I’m just so stressed and have a constant headache I go to see my therapist later today which is good I guess but I just needed to put this out there to kind of clear my head

if anyone read this then thank you, I’ll take it as a sign of validation hahaha"

You find yourself leading a life of self-imposed isolation, full of all kinds of self-hate, wishing desperately for some kind of validation, help, or support of some kind, wishing your friends (or really anyone) would actually reach out and give a shit...

...and then when someone does, and offers help or support of any kind, you get EXTREMELY uncomfortable with the human contact, and all the emotional aspects that come with it, to the point of getting really pissed off and hating that they even tried to feed you some obvious bullshit lie about you, “mattering,” or, “being worth something,” and wish people would just go away and leave you the fuck alone, thereby continuing the cycle of wanting someone to reach out but hating when they do? 

Seriously, what the fuck? I’ve noticed this pattern in myself and I can’t understand why. 

It feels like a combination of not deserving it and flat-out not knowing or even being able to begin to comprehend how to deal with actual genuine human emotion like that. It just freaks me out and makes me want to push away even harder, which logically I know makes it worse, but I can’t seem to break the cycle.

So after years of childhood trauma, anxiety and depression I finally got to a stage where I could afford decent therapy and had my first session today. My therapist seems really nice and her little room was the perfect environment for me to feel comfortable talking.

At the end she asked me what I wanted from therapy. As I was telling her all about me and my life, I was constantly worried about her thinking I was overreacting, judging my stories or thinking them not serious enough to require therapy and that I was just a weak person. She looked at my blankly and said ‘is it a big deal for you?’ I said, ‘yes, massively’ and she just simply replied ‘well then it’s a big deal...’, and just shrugged her shoulders and started talking about our next session.

Honestly it was like an epiphany. I realised that if something is a big deal in MY universe, then it is a big deal because it’s me that matters and someone else not thinking it’s serious does NOT invalidate that. I’m always so anxious that my problems will seem silly to someone else, but actually if they really care about helping you get through it, they won’t judge the nature of the problem but try and help you through it anyway because they know it’s a serious problem to you.

g8v0l8,Anxiety,Anyone else more anxious about COVID restrictions being lifted than they were about them being implemented?,"I have adapted really well to the social isolation and working from home thing. I have a great routine now (way more balance with work/life/health than I did pre-covid) and love having more time to spend with my pets, reading & contemplating. All the zoom meetings for work and maybe 1-2 virtual “catch ups” with friends every week are adequate for me socially. 

However when I think about how I’ll have to go back to my typical 8-5 grind with a 2 hour commute on top of those hours, I feel super anxious. Anybody else in a similar boat? 

Note I’m not saying I hope covid continues to thrive, I know it has had a severely negative impact on many people. I am just anxious at the thought of returning to what was my “normal life” that I hated."

fhrl00,Anxiety,"I’m an italian OCD and anxiety sufferer, and I’m here to tell you that it’s going to be okay.","I know you probably don’t believe me, but it WILL get better and easier. I know it sounds scary when governments start to put out all of those limitations and lockdowns, but it’s for the better. 

If you’re starting quarantine or are obligated to stay home just like we are, I promise you’ll get used to it. And not used to it in a negative way! There are so many things you can do at home: I baked so many cakes, I’m trying to do the splits, I’m reading all the books I never got a chance to read. Isolation is reaaally not that bad.

We have the amazing power of adaptation. Every tool you have learned to cope with your anxiety will come in super handy, and you’ll see how strong you are with them. Sometimes I imagine COVID-19 as the boss level of anxiety, and it gets me super pumped lol. It makes me want to kick its ass so much.

It’s a wild ride but if us italians are riding it out, you’ll ride it out as well!
Sending you all a giant hug. We’re in this shit together.

And please, remember this pro tip: check what is necessary to check on the news. And that means check only what YOU as a citizen need to do. Numbers will go super high, then super low, then high and low again... it’s a pain that you really don’t need in your everyday life. If it’s impossible for you to resist the urge, have a trusted loved one tell you the necessary things you need to know: if there are new limitations, if you can go to school / work , what you should do with your hands etc.

isjt2m,Anxiety,Anyone else feel like they are wasting their life by focusing on just having the day be over - but every day?,"Every day I have this anxiety about work, and every day I tel myself “well it’ll be over at 5pm” and then I have the evening but I go to bed very early because I’m tired of being anxious all day and then do it all over again in the morning. I feel like I’ve lost months of time like this. I don’t want to let my life disappear into just waiting for the days to be over."
hvi1fy,Anxiety,"I actually did it. Found an amazing new job in a much better city, faced my boss to quit my current job. Found a house, turned on utilities, and scheduled movers.","I'm not going to lie. It was hell. Every step of it was panic attacks, fear, and a rollercoaster of emotions. But I did it. And now I have such a massive feeling of relief. It really made clear that the only way to deal with things is literally just to face them head on. I wasn't going to have this amazing new house or job unless I pushed myself through. Period. 

If you're going through something and its hard to follow through, or hard to even start. Just try and think about the end goal, not the process. It doesnt make it easy. But it gives you just enough motivation to keep taking one more small step at a time. As Dory says, ""just keep swimming""."
9rqx5t,Anxiety,I know a lot of us take antidepressants for anxiety so here's a map I made about it,
ghiqy2,Anxiety,Does anyone else constantly feel like they’ve done something wrong after social interactions?,"Basically the title. I constantly feel like I’ve done or said something wrong or offensive and somebody is mad at me after social interactions. Especially with my family and friends. Even if the interactions ended positively and with hugs goodbye and such. I don’t have a bad relationship with any of them. I don’t consider myself anti social. I’ve mentioned this to my husband and some friends and have been told it’s all in my head basically(in the nicest way possible). My husband will reassure me that I’ve done nothing wrong and no one is mad at me, but I usually have a really hard time shaking the feeling and sometimes it even lasts into the next day. It happens all the time. He and others will say even if someone is mad at me that they’ll get over it, probably before I even see them again and I shouldn’t worry about it, but for some reason I can’t shake the guilty feeling. Is this just me?

EDIT:  I never expected this post to get the response that it did. I want to reply to everyone, but don’t want to be a broken record either. I’m sorry you all are suffering with this as well and I hope we all find some relief someday. It really helps me to know I’m not alone in these feelings. I hope knowing you’re not alone brings you some relief as well. And I’m nobody special, but if anyone ever needs to talk or share experiences I’m here."

i0tv3h,Anxiety,I don’t think most people understand how exhausting the physical symptoms of anxiety are,"There’s a lot of physical symptoms such as shaking, fidgeting, heavy breathing, rapid breathing, getting extremely overheated, rapid heartbeat, stomach pain, nausea, bathroom issues, etc. I think most people just assume it’s completely internal, but man it can be exhausting. Especially when you’re in an anxiety-inducing situation that is lengthy, such as a social outing. It can really take a toll on your energy and productivity, even the next day."

gnfhvp,Anxiety,"Anxiety Pro Tip: Anxiety thrives on your avoidance. If you have an anxiety-provoking task to do, make it your first task of the day. Otherwise, it'll only start to feel scarier and harder to complete in your mind.","Avoiding the anxiety-provoking task feels good in the short term because your brain feels like it has avoided some kind of threat. This is one of the reasons why procrastination feels so good! However, avoiding the task just reinforces your belief that the task *is* a threatening one, so the anxiety gets more intense the next time you come to it. 

Making it your first task will eliminate this vicious cycle altogether. You'll likely feel better as you'll get a sense of achievement from ""beating"" the anxiety-provoking thing. There is also the added bonus that it won't be nagging the back of your mind for the rest of the day!

All credit for this tip goes to u/TomClinPsy who posted it elsewhere but it was removed for some reason. Luckily I had screenshot it because it felt so profound to me."

i7pg2g,Anxiety,Healthy people talk about anxiety as if it’s something you can control...,"“Just breathe!” “Think positively.” “Worrying only makes you suffer twice.” Ya know, those kinds of saying. 

I wish it was that easy. If I could control it, it wouldn’t be called an illness. 

This morning I woke up feeling perfectly fine (which is rare), was sitting on my couch reading then all of the sudden, my heart started beating so fast for no fucking reason, and I started hyperventilating. It took like 2 hours to collect myself and I had no idea what that whole episode was about.

So don’t tell me it’s something I can control, I had a panic attack while thinking about literally nothing.

Edit: Thank you to all the healthy people that replied to this post saying: “We mean well”. I get that. But it’s not helpful at all, when we’re venting and your first reaction is defensiveness. Sometimes all we want is to be heard. I know this is irrational, but jumping in with a cure sometimes isn’t the best route. 

Also, to all my GAD fellows, thanks for reading & understanding."

i2jiqh,Anxiety,Does anybody else have anxiety on your days off because you are “wasting” it doing nothing?,"I have been like this for years but I feel it’s been worse lately because of COVID and the fact that I’ve been working from home. I always felt anxious/guilty when I would relax, hangout inside and play video games on my days off by myself. I felt like I was supposed to be doing something productive, exercising the dog, etc. But I was working a more labor intensive job before. I now have a desk call center job and have been stuck working from home since March. So on my days off, if I don’t have plans, I’m still home and feel like I should be out doing something. But some weekends I just want to do nothing, even if it’s beautiful out (I usually pray for rainy days when I’m off so I feel less guilty.) I also hate the heat so when it’s too hot, I don’t want to be outside. AND I usually get house chores done on my first day off so I can relax later but I still am anxious all day because I’m relaxing and playing video games. I feel like I waste my all my days off thinking of things I SHOULD have done and then when I go back to work, I feel like I wasted all my days off thinking of things I should be doing instead of mentally relaxing. I’ve honestly found myself either drinking or getting High more on my days off just so I can forget these feelings and relax.

*Edit to add, I’m also more introverted so making plans with friends can be exhausting but I do it and have fun every time. Recently all my weekends have been jam packed with plans so I wouldn’t feel like this but apparently it doesn’t work that way!"

adxy6z,Anxiety,"Does anyone feel depressed that their anxiety has kept them from experiencing major parts of a ""normal"" life?","I barely went out with friends when I was in high school. Always heard about my friends going out to parties, but I never went to one myself. In university, I avoided going out with friends, and mostly kept to myself. At the time, I didn't realize I had anxiety. But now, when I look back, knowing that I had anxiety and depression, it makes me really sad that I missed out on socializing and parties. Even though deep down I feel like I would have felt uncomfortable at them anyways. Not sure if that makes sense or not. It's sort of feeling like I wish I could have enjoyed them even though the reality is that I probably wouldn't have enjoyed them much even if I had had the opportunity to socialize more."

hhi5y0,Anxiety,I lost my companion of 18 years. People don’t understand how important a pet can be for people with anxiety/mental illness.,"I adopted my cat as a kitten when I was in grad school. I would not be where I am in my life without his love. Pets hold a special place for people with anxiety.  He was there providing comfort when I had bad days. He gave me purpose when I felt I had none. He gave me unconditional love. I didn’t have to worry about my insecurities around him. He loved me as I was. He was with me when I hit my rock bottom. He was with me during my years long recovery cheering me on and providing support during the low times. He gave me companionship when I would isolate because the world was too much to take.  He was my spirit animal. He had anxiety too and took Prozac. He was excited when I got home and would cry when I left, sometimes when I even just left the room. He loved me and I loved him and I will forever miss him and cherish the blessing he was in my life.

Edit: thank you everyone for your kind words. They do provide comfort. And thank you for the golds.

I have a great support system and a wonderful fiancé. She was with me at the vet when we had to put him to sleep. I told her my cat told me he was able to go now because he knew someone was there to take over for him in watching over me."

But instead of deleting everything because of all the ""what ifs"" and posting nothing at all I thought I'd finally write my first, rather unemotional, post on reddit (yay).

Also I'm procastinating important work stuff because I woke up with a lump in my throat and a nice slice of despair about my life -again- and have now literally been doing nothing but stalking the internet and pacing up and down, feeling bad about it (reasonable, yes). I know, there's not really much to answer on here and honestly, it's just one of those days I feel like an improper human being. I think I really need a very long hug.

I actually got a job. I did applications, I did interviews, and I didn’t have a panic meltdown ONCE. I actually impressed people. I actually got MY FIRST JOB. 

It’s a data entry clerk position and I can work remotely and there’s minimal social interaction besides the people on my team.

I never thought I’d be able to do this honestly. I overthink everything constantly and worry very easily and so I never thought id be able to actually handle a job. 

I even opened up a bank account today for myself. 

Sure, I’m anxious about starting work and worried I’m gonna be bad at it..but that’s a problem for me later. Right now im thrilled I even did it. It can get better y’all.

AMAZINGLY GOOD NEWS!!!!!!

A Chicago hospital that tested antibodies found 30 percent of those tested had antibodies.

https://chicagocitywire.com/stories/530092711-roseland-hospital-phlebotomist-30-of-those-tested-have-coronavirus-antibody

Magnifying this percentage to the entire USA population, that would mean the death rate for the virus is 0.015 percent, about on par with the seasonal flu. 
thanks

some really good news regarding asymptomatic spread! 

Per Wuhan Health Commission, the 300 asymptomatic carrier identified by large scale PCR testing between 15/05/2020 and 01/06/2020 have had their saliva and throat swab sample taken, and these samples have undergone isolation and incubation experiment at Chinese Academy of Science Wuhan. All samples have failed to result in incubation of live virus.

Experts believe the negative result of incubation experiments with the saliva and throat swab sample point at either minuscule viral load, or non-viable viral fragments unable to cause infection. Furthermore, samples from toothbrush, drinking cups, masks, towels and other personal effects have been taken from the 300 asymptomatic carriers, all have tested negative. On top of this, 1174 close contacts of the 300 asymptomatic carriers identified have all tested negative on PCR tests. All of these point at the conclusion that the asymptomatic carriers discovered in Wuhan are not infectious.

j61jth,Anxiety,You are safe,"Hey you. Hi. You are safe in this moment. I know you are scared. It makes sense that you would be scared. You’re not crazy and there is nothing wrong with you. 

Even though you are scared, you are safe. Even though you are scared, you are loved. I love you. I don’t know you, but if people can hate indiscriminately, I can love indiscriminately. I love you. There is love all around you in little, gentle ways. 

When someone smiles at you, they are sharing a small bit of love. When someone lets you pass in traffic or lets you merge, they are offering you a tiny bit of love.

Every “please” and “thank you” is love. Even when something is someone’s job - such as a store clerk wishing you a good day, or the coffee shop person chatting you up per corporate policy. They are still extending love.

Accept the little moments of love.

Accept the little moments of safety, too.

Right now, in this moment in time, you are safe.

It is okay to be afraid. I still love you. Do you love you? You must.

Hold yourself, please. Do it for me. Put your arms around yourself. Pet your face gently. Tell yourself, “I love you. You are safe. It is okay to be afraid. There is nothing wrong with you. You are human and you are feeling afraid and I am here with you.”

Do not treat yourself with contempt and do not abandon yourself for being afraid. You deserve unconditional love. Stay with yourself and be kind to yourself even though you are struggling.

Tell yourself, “I will not abandon you. I will not judge you. I will not reject you just because you are afraid.”

Keep your promise to yourself.

Tell yourself “I love you, sweetheart.”

When you are ready, share a small bit of love with others. Smile to them. Say please and thank you. Wish them well. Be kind. Let them merge in traffic. Do it without expectation for something in return.

Pick up a piece of trash because you love the park. Say, “I love you park. Let me help you feel nice. It’s okay. I got this.” (Even if you just say it in your head).

Radiate love and safety. Receive love and safety.

I love you.

Pass it on."

We can fix it.""","I struggle hard with CBT precisely because a lot of the techniques seem to focus on helping me realize my anxiety is illogical - it's like no Shit Sherlock, I knew that.

These struggles are so rough and facing it everyday is really something.  But; struggling does not negate your strength.  We are infinite wells of resilience because we have to be, we all deserve love and kindness and warmth every single day.  ❤️❤️

Generalized Anxiety Disorder
Social Anxiety Disorder
Panic Disorder
Body Dysmorphia  
Anorexia Nervosa
PTSD from childhood emotional/physical abuse 
PTSD from being raped when I was 17
PTSD from the illness and death of my mom at the age of 12 

I’ve been unemployed for 6 months and my last job was in a RAMPANT environment of sexual harassment it was disgusting.

gwfrjt,Anxiety,Today I had a job interview and I managed to go. No one seems to understand that for some people it's a tremendous struggle.,"I have really bad IBS with panic-/anxiety disorder and those two combined make it extremely difficult to travel. I don't have a car so I have to use the public transport.

90% of the time when I leave the house I get the runs. Like really bad. Almost always I have to turn back, take a shit and try again. Sometimes it doesn't work and I can't go. Not even to the grocery store for example.

I've used meds (benzos) for it for a while which usually work, but whenever I try to seek help the nr1 concern is "" well you gotta get rid of those pills "". I don't care a flying fuck if I'm injecting heroine if I manage to go to work, leave the house, do normal stuff.

Not even 1% of people can fathom the struggle some people have to just go buy groceries.

I've tried to seek help with this but every single time **only** thing I hear is "" stop using meds "". I've used benzos 3 times in past 3 weeks. I'm improving, no one cares. I'm working on my diet and excercise, no one cares. All I hear is "" stop using meds, stop using meds "". From medical professionals, family and friends.

True, meds might make it so that without them normal things become more difficult. But my goal for now is to travel to work. Any means necessary. Okay I stop meds then what ? No one gives me the step 2.

I've been unemployed for 6 months and my nr1 goal is to get a job, manage to get there and do well.

Thanks for the rant. Peace.

Edit/update:

Had a dr's appointment today.  I told her several times that my only goal is to travel to work. I said very clearly that I still need help, but I didn't care if it was in a form of benzo's, other meds or therapy.

As a result she prescribed more benzo's. And psyllium seeds. Also according to her, stomach problems and panic disorder are completely unrelated and have nothing to do with eachother... sigh."
kc3g43,Anxiety,I hate when people use “panic attack” as a way to say they got nervous for a sec,"I don’t know if it’s just me but when people have omg moments where they get scared for a sec and say they had a panic attack, it really bugs me. Like no... that’s not what a panic attack feels like bro... It’s actually when you feel like you’re dying for no reason at all. Like all the air in the room is sucked out and logically you know it’s not true but your whole body and mind is telling you it’s over. Is that how it felt when you got nervous for a sec when you dropped something or forgot something? It just promotes a culture that misunderstands what people with panic disorders go through."

kk6u2r,Anxiety,The best gift I could have gotten on Christmas,"My teenage son has OCD and for the last year+ his brain has been telling him that I am “infected” so he often won’t stay in the same room as me, sometimes won’t talk to me, races away from me and won’t touch things that I’ve touched.

It’s incredibly challenging and hurts my heart.

For Christmas, he said I get a hug. I could see him taking deep breaths (subtly) and preparing himself. I asked how long I could hug him and he said as long as I wanted. When I hugged him, I asked him if I could give him a kiss, too, and he said yes, so I kissed his head.

It filled my heart with so much warmth and peace and happiness and I can still feel it a couple hours later.

I truly understand anxiety and I know just how difficult this was for him. It was the most selfless and loving and special gift I could have gotten.

Also, as a side note, my older son got me an extra gift for my stocking because I’m divorced and this is my first Christmas as a single woman. (I invited their father over last year to help them with the transition, but not this year). My son wanted to be sure I had something in my stocking since my ex always did that for me.

I feel so loved by my thoughtful sons."

i just find that so strange to think about. i can’t imagine living like that. really, i wish i could live like that.

jgczkl,Anxiety,I absolutely hate being a high-functioning person with generalized & social anxiety disorder.,"I go through my day and no one knows how much effort it takes me to fake socializing, to fake talking to people, most people just assume I'm a bitch at first until they get to know me because I don't speak up very much but when I do, I sound confident.. but only because I FORCE myself to. 

I get most things done on my checklist. I workout, I eat healthy, I have a degree, I'm in a relationship, I pay my bills, I seem like I have my shit together. But I don't. I spend most of my time over-analzying things I've said, walking around faking everything all day, worried I can't trust anyone around me and over-analzying my relationship, calling myself a loser, telling myself I'm not good enough, having PTSD flashbacks from an abusive childhood. And it's wild that no one has any idea. And I'll never let them know. Because I'm embarrassed.

So if you see someone who seems like they have their shit together or you're jealous, or you think they just don't talk to you a lot because they don't like you.. maybe consider that they are high-functioning. I think we tend to forget that depression & anxiety don't only present as not being able to get out of bed or do anything."

gzqpsw,Anxiety,I think I prefer depression over anxiety,"After a very anxious week I feel burnt out. Now I feel just depressed, the kind of depressive state that is tolerable. 

I feel no sadness and anger, I am just tired and indifferent. My brain is so tired that I have no energy to be anxious. That kinda feels good. Without paralyzing terror I can do small things, not overly passionate, but just good enough. 

My baseline is so low, that I feel happy being just depressed.
_____
Edit: I think it needs to be here, ‘Objectively, depression and anxiety both suck, sometimes **the change** from months long depression to anxiety, and vice versa, **feels better**. Then you realize it is not energy or motivation but anxiety, it is not calmness it is numbness from depression. I really hope you will get better and find help, because those changes between those two are sometimes very misleading, and can be a false promise. Do not postpone the therapy or whatever you were meaning to do or start. And change that baseline of feeling good to a higher norm’."
homwjx,Anxiety,I just realised the reason I panic when I make mistakes is because I was punished for mistakes in my childhood.,"One of my earliest memories is from when I was about 4 years old. While I was playing in the garden I fell over and injured my hand. My knuckle was bleeding quite a lot and I still have a scar from the injury to this day. Crying, I ran inside to my mother.

After treating my wound, she spanked me as punishment for my mistake.

If my mother had decided to give me comfort and reassurance in these kinds of situations, maybe in my adulthood, when I made a mistake, my natural response would be to try to soothe myself and calm down.

Instead, when I make a mistake, my natural response is to feel anxiety or panic, and it's really difficult for me to calm down.

I'm hoping that this realisation will be the first step towards me being able to overwrite my childhood conditioning and learn how to treat myself with acceptance and understanding."
fq8z5a,Anxiety,"Does anyone else get avoidance anxiety from text messages, emails, Reddit mail, any electronic correspondence?","Like I enjoy chatting with people in person, over the phone I don’t mind, either. With new people I get slight anxiety but it’s not crippling in any way. 

However, for some reason e-correspondence really gets me. Especially talking to people who are very pushy and demanding for quick replies. I don’t always feel like answering at the moment so I’ll put it off, but then I get very anxious knowing the reply is waiting for me, and I ignore it, and it makes me more anxious thinking the person is getting angry at me, and it’s a very vicious cycle. 

The only time I don’t feel this way is when I’m either very busy working (and then I use the messages as a welcome distraction) or when I take Adderall for ADHD, because then I feel very assertive and have no fear. 

I think the lock down has made things worse because now I don’t go to the gym (usual fear release) and there’s no social time to replenish my mind in preparation for online messages, since they take a lot of mental effort. 

I’m curious to see if anyone else experiences this, and hopefully I won’t avoid your replies 😆

=========

Edit: Lmao this post blew up, and now I have 40+ replies to read. The irony is astounding! But I am to hear everyone else’s experiences too. 

I was thinking more and part of it may be due to the fact that each online message represents another demand on our time and another decision we must make. At least that’s part of the issue. And diverts from our energy when already in an inert place.

Take care of yourselves, everyone >< Gonna go take a relaxing bath after reading the replies here"
ivzrch,Anxiety,"Guys, not only did I get a decent job after not working for 4 years but I haven't called or been late yet after my first week!","Im a terrible flake when it comes to work. My anxiety goes up right before i go in and I end up getting sick and calling off or just not showing up. I'm a terribly unreliable worker.

4 years ago I went thru a tumultuous divorce from a marriage making my anxiety worse everyday. So from then on I've been out of work and my partner has been taking care of me. A series of events that I'd rather not go into happened and I was pushed to finally get back into the work force. 

Im an animal person and for some months been debating on going to school to become a vet tech. On the 11th I got hired to work at an animal shelter I use to occasionally volunteer for. The director was slightly reluctant to hire me because again I was a flake during volunteering partly because my anxiety/overall mental health and the fact it wasn't a real job made me not take it seriously. 

Well its been my first week and I haven't had any panic attacks at work or felt the urge to call off or been late. I hope i can keep this up as I really like my job and the staff is pretty good. 

I feel like I've turned the corner on my anxieties and hope i can go back to being the strong person I once was.

Dear everyone,  
  
I am writing to let you know I am reading each and every single one of your comments. I made this post because I saw many posts talking about how scared folks are. Truth be told, I am scared too. I'm scared everyday. That's life with anxiety. Sometimes it is really small and it feels like I can just ""ignore"" it and put it in my back pocket, and sometimes it is really huge and like a gigantic elephant stomping around in my brain.  
  
I recognize the tendency in myself to get caught up in negative feedback loops (including obsessively reading about horrible things and obsessing over current events) and decided I would post something somewhat different for us because sometimes, just being honest, coming to /r/anxiety can leave me feeling a bit more anxious, lol.  
  
Whatever the case, I want to thank you all once again for taking the time to share your thoughts and feelings. It is good to know we're not alone. There are so many of us out there who want to see good things come out in the world. I want to share a passage that is comforting to me when things become difficult, and hope maybe it will be of some small comfort to y'all as well.  
  
>""The life of Man is a long march through the night, surrounded by invisible foes, tortured by weariness and pain, towards a goal that few can hope to reach, and where none may tarry long. One by one, as they march, our comrades vanish from our sight, seized by the silent orders of omnipotent Death. Very brief is the time in which we can help them, in which their happiness or misery is decided. Be it ours to shed sunshine on their path, to lighten their sorrows by the balm of sympathy, to give them the pure joy of a never-tiring affection, to strengthen failing courage, to instil faith in hours of despair. Let us not weigh in grudging scales their merits and demerits, but let us think only of their need--of the sorrows, the difficulties, perhaps the blindnesses, that make the misery of their lives; let us remember that they are fellow-sufferers in the same darkness, actors in the same tragedy as ourselves. And so, when their day is over, when their good and their evil have become eternal by the immortality of the past, be it ours to feel that, where they suffered, where they failed, no deed of ours was the cause; but wherever a spark of the divine fire kindled in their hearts, we were ready with encouragement, with sympathy, with brave words in which high courage glowed.""

a09jss,Anxiety,I always want to post in this subreddit but I know I’ll feel like a failure if I don’t get upvotes.,"Does this happen to anyone else? I actually think this sub is a great tool for cathartic sharing among people with anxiety, and I know I could derive some benefit in allowing myself to post more. But there’s some silly irony in me thinking “Well what if this gets ignored? What if people think this is dumb or invalid?”. Even right now as I type this I think “Oh yeah this is so witty and meta, this will definitely get me to the top of the sub” which is so in line with every obsession I have about being special, being great, being loved, etc — and my inability to just do or enjoy the small things for what they are without some greater sense of meaning. 

EDIT: Ha, this blew up, how poetic. The joy or validation I feel from the upvotes doesn’t match the negativity I would have felt if it went unnoticed, which is good to know! You all are wonderful and this is a great community. I’ve come a long way with my anxiety and I’m working on a project to help and give back to those struggling and those who have helped me, so I hope to see you all here again. ❤️❤️❤️"
gbnjuv,Anxiety,Anyone else anxious and scared about lockdown being lifted and having to attain responsibility and normality again?,"I've never had much of an issue with being in quarantine, I liked being able to stay inside and watch television or listen to music all day. My country in now in talk to begin easing lockdown within a few weeks and I'm getting very nervous about having to go out and get a job and get back into the cycle where people need me to do things and have expectations of me etc"
a5w4nc,Anxiety,I JUST CALLED INTO A PIZZA PLACE!!!,"I'm still shaking. Making phone calls gives me the biggest anxiety. I asked whether it's not too late to have it delivered into my area. Person said no but that I'd have it better to order it online anyway. So it was a shorter and less complicated phone call than I was preparing for but that doesn't change the fact that I did it! I dialed the fuck out of that number, fucking killed it!! EAT A DICK, ANXIETY.

Edit: I make a phone call and get my first gold in the same day?! This literally made my whole month. Your guys' support, advice and kind words on this post have been overwhelming. I did not expect it to blow up so much but I'm grateful it did. I'm so motivated and inspired by your words that I'm now less scared to push myself even further. Thank you all from the bottom of my heart. "
ik8d8u,Anxiety,I just broke down crying because it feels like no one wants to listen to a man say that he's struggling,"I tried bringing up my struggles with anxiety and depression today and either they don't answer or just tell me they love me, which I appreciate but no one every wants to know what I'm actually feeling and I can only get so much relief from writing in a journal. It's just not the same. Everyone always immediately backs up my girlfriend when she is struggling and I'm just supposed to figure it out."

exx6jc,Anxiety,Does anyone else get super sensitive to noise when they’re anxious?,Whenever I’m feeling really anxious my hearing seems super sensitive and sounds/voices can be overwhelming. When I get like this I get super irritated by people talking and loud noises. Does this happen to anyone else? Sometimes it gets to the point where I want to put in headphones to drown out the noises I can’t control.

jwo1kd,Anxiety,You are strong . Anxiety is hell. We live through our fears and survive it everytime.,"A lot of people who don't deal with anxiety, or have a panic disorder/generalized anxiety disorder think it's just fear, or being nervous. It is WAY deeper than that. We go through hell. It is more than just having a "" phobia "" . It is really scary to go through . For some of us it's like being on a bad trip of LSD or weed 24/7 . To everyone reading this , don't be ashamed of your anxiety. You are a freaking warrior. A freaking soldier. I don't care if your anxiety ""isn't as bad"" as others , or if you don't feel included because you haven't felt the most severe of panic attacks. Maybe your panic attacks are small. I dont care, because you still SURVIVED it. We all did. So to you,  I love you. Keep fighting."

Thinking, Planning, problem solving, and of course, worrying. Then worrying some more. I'm never in the current moment, my mind is always in the future. Before I know it, the day is over, and I have barely acknowledged/talked to anybody and barely looked anyone in the eye.

I'm not miserable, I just need to get out of of my head, stop worrying with my mind jumping from one thing to the next, stop getting frustrated and irritated, stop overthinking everything, and instead actually live life and enjoy it."
gvgkdk,Anxiety,does anyone get extremely anxious when people around them are angry or mad?,"so, i have noticed that whenever someone around me is in a bad mood especially if they are frustrated or angry, i get this feeling like i just wanna hide and lock myself in a box. i usually rush to my room, turn off all the lights to calm myself, put on my earphone and play the loudest music to drain out any loud voices. i think this comes from my traumatic childhood because my parents were always screaming at each other. anyways, does anyone do this? i need some feedback cuz im pretty sure i have anxiety but i dint wanna diagnose myself too early."

frslfn,Anxiety,Do you guys need constant reassurance that everyone is not mad at you?,"I always assume the worst. And now that we’re have to practice social distancing it’s making it a lot easier to think negative thoughts. I know they are irrational but sometimes my mind just convinces me that they are true. I feel like I need constant reassurance from my friends so I know they aren’t mad me even though it makes no sense for them to be mad at me because there has been no actual conflict between us. I guess since I haven’t physically seen any of my friends it has gotten really had to stay on track mentally. Like before of this quarantine started we use to spend almost all day everyday together, now everything is through text and for me, I would rather talk to someone face to face so I know what their tone of voice is. Sometimes my mind just thinks really stupid things and it’s really hard to stop it. Does anybody else feel this way too?"

cvnazg,Anxiety,The side of anxiety most people don’t understand.,"Started a new job about a month ago, finally received my embroidered shirts that I’m required to wear. Go to put one on and it doesn’t fit, none of them do. Now I’m having to wear the plain t-shirt into work until they can order me more. I woke up 2 1/2 hours early to make sure I was ready. Now I’m sitting in a parking lot nearby being so nervous to have to tell my boss they don’t fit. Anxiety is having to go through every scenario possible that can happen when I go back in. My body hurts physically and I feel nauseous over this. All over a simple fix that will take him 5 seconds to handle in reality, but my brain doesn’t work that way. This sucks ☹️"

971qny,Anxiety,I impulsively asked a girl out yesterday IN PERSON. She told me she had a boyfriend but I'm honestly just proud of myself for even doing it.,"SHe's this girl who works at a local tobacco shop. I kind of knew she probably had a boyfriend and I'd get shut down. She was super polite and it was all good. I imagine it will be ( a little bit ) easier next time I want to do this. I was embarrassed for a few minutes but it passed eventually. Sitting here the next day, I can't believe I did that but I'm proud of myself. Just had to tell someone! Thanks guys.

Edit: Just to add what was going through my mind at the time. My psychologist has really been getting me to expose myself to uncomfortable situations especially when you know they're going to be uncomfortable. I kind of figured she had a boyfriend/didn't date customers or whatever but I considered this an experiment in allowing myself to become uncomfortable, and just sitting with that feeling for a while. It's this kind of stuff that almost literally rewires your brain (albeit small amounts over time). If you keep avoiding things, your brain will get used to it and that's how you end up using avoidance to deal with being uncomfortable. If you expose yourself to those uncomfortable situations and allow them to run their course, those feelings start to become a lot less scary over time which can help build confidence. I'm no Psychologist so that was probably a C+ at best explanation but hopefully it makes some sense.

Edit 2: Holy Moley the amount of encouragement and props is insane. You all are awesome. Thank you."
lqt7cs,Anxiety,"The whole world seems excited for lockdown to end, but no one seems to be talking about those of us who are feeling anxious about normal life returning. Surely I am not on my own?","This has been a strange year for everyone, with huge life changes for all and so much sadness throughout. Even if your lockdown experience has been overly positive, you will undoubtedly have experienced any number of struggles along the way. 

My relationship with my girlfriend ended almost 2 months ago now, and whilst there have been good days and bad days, I can’t help shake this feeling of dread and anxiety over normal life returning. It’s as if life is going to take off full speed ahead and I’m going to be left in its wake, struggling to adjust to this new single way of life. 

Everything you hear on the news speaks about excitement, parties, pubs, nightclubs and all the ‘joy’ that this is going to bring, but no one seems to address the fact that it’s going to be a real struggle to adjust back into this ‘normal’ way of life for many of us.

I’m sure I’m not alone in this and I’d love to hear that others are feeling the same way x"

it45rb,Anxiety,Does anyone else feel like their outlook on life is incredibly dependent on how anxious they’re feeling at any given moment?,"First time posting/visiting the sub, as my anxiety just seems to be getting worse.

I’m a senior in college and the uncertainty that lies ahead of me is unbearable. I’ll go through rough phases where everything, from classes to planning for careers/grad school seems like the most daunting thing, and I just wish to stay in the present. I can’t see a light, and I feel so trapped inside myself it’s debilitating.

Other days, or periods of time shorter than days, I’ll feel like I have the ability to be and do great. In those few and far in between instances I feel sane, and relatively calm, eager for the future.

What I can’t stand the most is not controlling how i feel, and when I feel it. It’s so volatile and I can only hope that days in which important tasks take place are days I feel I’m in control. I feel like I’m slowly drowning, and I have no idea how to stop it or stabilize myself."

Like I can't describe it but it's definitely not good. Almost like something is pinching on my organs. And the worst is when I have to wake up in the morning, it's almost like someone has placed added extra weights to my body. I literally can't get up from my bed! I try to force myself up,but I just can't. I just lay there staring at the ceiling, thinking about what I'll do with my day, get anxious about what if I won't be able to be productive today, then getting anxious about how I wasted some time the previous day, then overthinking it all nd wanting to just kill myself.

jroy1r,Anxiety,Does anyone else get anxious when they hear any type of yelling?,"Before I start, I want to mention that I have not been diagnosed with anxiety so far, but this is the only community where I feel like I can let this out and ask this question. (Also im new to Reddit and don’t know how exactly this works, so if I do anything wrong please let me know) 

So I’m currently 18 years old and as for my childhood I’d say it was okay. I was a pretty shy and ‘good’ kid so never got into trouble much. That’s also why I can’t recall ever being yelled at or hit. Maybe once, but my parent did apologise and state what they did wasn’t okay so I don’t think that would have affected me.

However, I get so anxious when I hear anybody yell. It doesn’t even have to be directed at me. A few examples: one of my teachers has a pretty strong, loud voice. When he suddenly calls out a student’s name while I’m doing my homework, I pretty much flinch even though his tone isn’t even angry. 

Or a few weeks ago when a classmate wasn’t wearing a mask, a teacher followed them into our classroom and basically yelled at them for at least a minute. While this was going on, I forced myself to just look down at my notebook and focus on anything but the yelling. Though I tried to distract myself, my eyes were teary and I felt a lump in my throat and I was really tense for the rest of that class. I think that was the most anxious I had felt in years. 

My sibling who is 12 can be described as a ‘troublemaker’ I guess. They’re the opposite of me which can be good at times, but it sometimes gets on my parents’ nerves. They don’t listen, aren’t okay with being told “no” and pretty much do what they want when they feel like it. Because of this I often hear my parents being upset at them and I’ve heard my parent yell at them a lot. Sometimes I’d be in the same room, other times I’d be in my room and they’d be downstairs. During these times I’ll also get very tense and just have a horrible feeling. If I’m in the same room I won’t even say a word and just get up and leave because it’s too much. 

I have no idea what to do with this. I have an intake at a therapist next week for some mental health related issues, should I bring this up too? And does this happen to anyone else? I really don’t understand why this happens to me 

Thank you in advance for the help :)"

I've had anxiety disorder about  6 years (it's getting a little better) but I feel like it's messed up my brain. I can't think clear, I don't have interest in things like I used to, i have zero motivation to  care and many things are overwhelming.

I feel like it's hard for me to comprehend what others are saying and I don't have anything important to say. Hell, I don't even know how to ""act"" around people anymore other than my few close friends and fiance.  
My brain is always on , it's exhausting. I obsess about the things that bother me, yet too scared to change them.

Your physical symptoms, although they feel very real, are normal and aren't going to hurt you. I PROMISE. I know they are so annoying, but the more you wish them away, the more persistent they become. 

You deserve to rest. I know everyone expects productivity from you right now, but it's okay to sleep longer than usual, play video games, or eat what you want. Do what you can, not what you think you should be doing. If everything feels like it's going to shit, take a few deep breaths, turn on some rain noises and take a nap.

Cut yourself some slack. You are going through a tough time. You are exhausted. You are tired of feeling like crap. It feels like it's never going to end. So give yourself a break. This shit is tough, but so are you. Don't beat yourself up.

My boyfriend told me that I should try to go because this was something I needed to do since I already got paid for the item. Sometimes all you need is some support from one person to tell you that you’ll be fine about a certain situation

I can recall as a kid, we had this family camp deep, deep into the woods- it was probably about a mile in, and no real road. Just a path created by my dad's truck. We would often get stuck in the mud, so mom would have my sister I grab our things, and we hiked our way into camp while my dad got the truck out of the mud.

This camp was the best- surrounded by forest, it was quiet, isolated. No electricity- we had to use oil lamps. No running water- my sister and I would have to run to the nearby creek and bring back 5 gallon buckets when we needed water.

It would rain sometimes when we were there and I always loved just lying on my bed, listening to the rain as it hit the tin roof.

I miss that place so much. I haven't been since the early/mid-90's. I recently asked my dad about going back, and he said others in the family took the camp over and sold some of the forest land. He says when you go there now, it looks nothing like it did in the 90s. All the forest and trees have been cut down and it's turned into a logging area.

Kinda breaks my heart... but at least I have the memories. And the falling rain reminds me of those wonderful memories. But the sound too is just so relaxing and soothing."

ixvfxh,Anxiety,Does anyone else literally FEEL anxiety flow through your body in stressful situations?,"I suffer from social anxiety, and sometimes in class my name will be called or I'm the center of attention  and i get this cold rush from head to toe that gives off a sort of shocking feeling hard to explain just wondering if anyone else experiences this :/ thanks for reading :)."

gz94tp,Anxiety,"For me, having anxiety (GAD) is like a game of Snakes & Ladders. One minute I’m feeling motivated, focused, and hopeful. The next, it’s as though the floor is collapsing below me.","My heart rate increases. I start to feel like people expect things from me that I can’t deliver (even though no one is expecting anything from me). I’ve had people in life remark “wow, you really have your shit together” but if only they knew that the outside doesn’t always match the inside. On paper it looks like I could be an overachiever but I am horribly debilitated by imposter syndrome and feeling like I always have something to prove. I’m 37F and have come to realize that I need to live in peace with my anxiety and stop trying to yield it to me all the time. It has its own plan and I need to roll with the punches. If I fight it for too long I exhaust myself and feel worse about myself. On my worst days I’ll have to take an Ativan to cope with the zero gravity rib cage crushing feeling - but if I’m lucky I hope to make friends with it so the floor doesn’t fall out from under me."
eonw76,Anxiety,"Does anyone else hate when they start talking about something they’re passionate about, but then start to feel like they’re being annoying and then stop talking about it?","To explain, 

I used to live in a decent sized city, and I found backroads in the country that takes me on a nice drive away from all of the light pollution and it’s nice to just be away from people and enjoy the country. Anytime I was feeling down or negative I would just hop in my car and go. The drive took about an hour and it was really peaceful, by the time I got home I was usually in a much better headspace. I just really loved that drive. 

When explaining the drive to a girl I was really into at the time, she was talking about how it’s impossible to remember that drive and every turn because there are many. I have driven on those roads enough to remember exactly when to take each turn, I proceeded to go over every turn. about halfway through is when i began to overthink everything. 

“does she actually give a shit about this?”

“you look stupid just stop”

the usual. 

I then stopped halfway through everything, gave like a half smile and said that I had forgot. 

This is just something that always goes through my head, there are probably better explanations on this but this is the first one that came to mind. Thanks for letting me vent guys."
b9ex6m,Anxiety,"Most people are accepting of you having an anxiety disorder, but an unfortunate amount of people expect you to only have symptoms in private.","A stigma that I’ve noticed in the mental health community... so many people are happy to talk about it and embrace your differences, but oh no.. don’t have a panic attack in front of them, don’t seek re-assurance from today’s anxious thoughts and jitters. 

This is something that needs changing. It is more than ok for someone with diabetes to be comforted even when their their blood sugar gets too low and it affects their work. Even if the circumstances of the blip in their health was due to poor diet or a rough week (I had a co-worker that had this happen at work) but when I struggled with low mood I was told ‘we all have days like that’ ... ‘don’t let customers see you unhappy or uncomfortable’ 

This is an issue with how subjective everyday anxiety and a chronic mental health issue is, if someone does not understand the effort it takes to behave normally they will default to judging you based on how they deal with it. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I’m lucky to have family and a handful of friends that have seen me go though treatments and recovery so know the full spectrum of my issues and do not judge or baby me. 

I felt like sharing this little rant to hear your thoughts on if you’ve been accepted or told to ‘hide’ symptoms from the public to spare THEIR discomfort... like your doing it on purpose. "
b51xc1,Anxiety,A Monday reminder,
lpa08i,Anxiety,Please start exercising,"I’ve had absolutely crippling anxiety for the past 2 years. I would end up in the ER, sometimes 2, 3, even 4 times a week because of intense panic attacks. I would have seizure like activity and the doctors thought I was having seizures when I was coming in or I had a brain bleed. It was horrible.

But recently I’ve started working out. I walk for an hour at about 3.5 MPH (brisk pace) and lift weights for about 30/40 mins. Sometimes I’ll skip lifting certain days if I’m too sore or skip walking if my shins hurt too much and use that day to self care and R.I.C.E. to avoid injury. 

When I tell you I’m a different person, I really am. Just after about a week and a half so much has changed. I haven’t had a panic attack or anxiety for about a week. I became a hypochondriac and would worry about every little thing in my body. I have chronic pain so most bodily sensations are extremely exaggerated because my nerve sensitivity. Even when I have bowel movements they can be uncomfortable for painful when most people don’t notice them. I’ve really honestly ignored a lot of them. I can go through my day with my pain pretty much fine now. I’m starting to get some of my natural humor and confidence back. Not much has really changed on the surface, but my mind has healed to what feels like years worth of therapy. 

I’m planning on continuing this, and I would recommend you start if you haven’t been already. Once you start working out you will enjoy it, as long as you ease into it and don’t overwhelm yourself. You’ll start to enjoy it and make goals. And the future will no longer be littered with fears and anxieties, but hope and motivation towards your goals. 

Best of luck to all of you!

Edit: WOAH! I had no idea this was going to explode! Thank you everyone for the awards and your kind words. I wish everyone luck. I’m sorry to anyone who said they’re unable to workout for any reason. I highly suggest trying to contact a specialist (doctor/private trainer/psychologist/therapist etc.) to help you work through any limitations you’re having. Everyone should have at least one thing they can escape to to help their anxiety. 

I do still get some anxiety working out but with time it’s subsiding. What helped the most was easing into it and making sure I was comfortable with my heart rate before trying to push myself. It’s not perfect but it’s just enough freedom to allow myself to improve my stamina and strength."
c5uovo,Anxiety,"after almost canceling an interview today due to anxiety, I forced myself to go, went in there, and killed it!!!!!","I was SO nervous all last night and all day today about this interview. Interviews are a MAJOR trigger for me, I almost always have an anxiety attack in the middle of them, and I’m really not very good at them. On top of that, it was for a bilingual role and I knew I’d have to speak German and I was so insecure about my fluency and so freaking anxious that I would totally bomb and embarrass myself. 

I was SO close to canceling. I made a million excuses to my friends in family about why I didn’t really want the job anyway so I might as well not go. I am so, so glad I didn’t. 

I experienced a bit of anxiety, but no attacks! I wasn’t stammering and awkward like I usually am and I was really confident in all of my answers. Best of all, when they brought in the German dude so I could converse with him, he said it was really good and my pronunciation was great, and after he left they all said he’s Never been impressed by anyone’s German before!!!

I never feel good or confident after leaving an interview, but this time I do. I Really Really Really hope I get the job (the office is UNREAL, benefits are wild, free breakfast and lunch, everyone was super laid back, better pay) but even if I don’t, I’m just so damn proud of myself for forcing myself to go instead of bailing like I always do.

Just had to share because I feel super happy right now. :) wish me luck!

Your heart is pounding and occasionally skipping? You guessed it, also normal. Those feelings of dread and like everything is gonna go wrong? Yep, normal and goes hand in hand with all these sensations when we're too aware of them. 100% of the sensations you're feeling and going through are normal in every day life, We're just unfortunately hyper aware of them. We feel a pain or uncomfortable sensation and our minds immediately go to the worst possible scenario, death, but that won't be the outcome. These things may be scary and uncomfortable, but they won't be the death of us. We've felt them numerous times before and haven't dropped dead then, we won't drop dead now. Stay strong everyone.

&#x200B;

Yesterday evening I got a call that they wanted me there today. I said sure, started prepping for the journey ( buses/trains are the most difficult part for me ). I ate all the right foods, slept enough, felt good. I took max dose of meds to ""guarantee"" success. 

Even with the meds and proper mindset, I was struggling at the second I left the house. Every step felt heavy, I wanted to turn back instantly. I made it to the first train then to the trainstation which had a bathroom. I had 45minutes to gather my thoughts before taking the next train to the destination.

I got on the train and things just got worse and worse and worse. Every passing stop I just wanted to jump out, crawl into a ball and cry. 2nd to last stop it became unbearable. I jumped off the train and took the next bus home. Mission failed.

I called my employer and was brutally honest about my situation. They seemed very understanding and offered to keep a 0hr contract indefinitely if I get my things together to a stage where I can reliably commute to work. So I made a good first impression and this guy seemed to appreciate honesty instead of me making up some bs lie about "" having some upper respetory symptoms "" or whatever which would've bought me some time. But I like honesty. I don't have to remember any lies and a lot of people appreciate it.

Even tho they were very kind and understandable, I feel like absolute shit right now. For past 7months my **only** goal was get a job, go there, do well. Be normal. Today even with medication I couldn't do that.

I haven't given up all hope yet and I'll start improving my diet even more and hopefully get to therapy asap. Apparently for people like me, sometimes the therapist meets half way if they know that leaving the house is difficult for the patient. Or even comes to your house. So that's great.

This was a major, major setback, but as my dad says "" You do everything you can, and that's all you can do "". I did everything. I prepared for everything. I had everything packed hours before leaving the house. I had a plan for when I get to work. But nope. Anxiety and panic disorder won this battle. Hopefully I'll win the war. 

And what gives a little extra twist to this: Traveling by car is fine. No problem whatsoever. But if I can't get to work, I can't afford a car. And if I can't take the bus, I can't get to work. Fml."

h7i75t,Anxiety,"Everyone seems to be afraid that the coronavirus lockdown will never end, but I’m afraid of the fact that it will.","I don’t want to go back to my job.

It feels like lockdown has slowed the world down to my pace, things aren’t so fast and intense anymore, I feel like I have time to keep up with things and enjoy things. Is it having it’s downsides? Yeah, but I can’t say that the negatives are outweighing the positives. I go back to work next week and I’m dreading it so much. I’m so anxious around people and they can observe it, so naturally a lot of people are apprehensive about speaking to me, or that’s how it seems, and I find it so difficult to actually attempt to fit in. It feels like once the lockdown is over people will go back to their social lives and will be able to enjoy themselves, but I won’t, because I haven’t got a social life. All I’m going to get out of lockdown finishing is the gift of going back to my torturous work."

hd78e8,Anxiety,Does anyone else feel anger toward their parents for “causing” their anxiety disorder?,"As I have gotten older, I have started to realize that my parents(mostly my mom) have a lot to do with my anxiety. My mom has been all over me since i’ve been a little kid. She shit talks everyone, always points out my flaws, and in general has tried to control my life. 

This has made me anxious, insecure, and have a low self esteem. I can usually circle back most of my anxiety back to how she has treated me over the years. Some of it came from bullying too of course.

My main point is that: does anyone else with a similar upbringing have any sort of anger toward their parents for some of the mental issues they might have caused? I am now almost 22 and I find myself upset with how my parents raised me. I am trying to pick up all the pieces and push myself in the right direction because in a lot of ways my parents failed. 




**Disclaimer**: let me say that I am not trying to pull a victim card here. I try my best to take responsibility for how I am and am doing my best to correct my issues. My parents have done A LOT for me over the years and I am grateful for that. I just have some internal rage built up."

For some inexplicable reason I just hate being seen doing something or being heard doing absolutely anything, be it listening to music out loud or watching a video. It's not like any of it is inherently embarrassing either, which makes it very hard for me to justify acquiring muscle memory for Win + L / Win + D and waiting until the person walks out.

geiyn7,Anxiety,Anyone else completely avoid tasks because they don't think they'll be good enough at it?,"I have this a lot. I'll avoid cooking a new thing or doing a new task because I don't think I'll do a good enough job. I've noticed that a lot of my anxiety stems from a fear of disappointing other people, and I know that if I were to do a task for myself I could probably do it.

Part of me wants to try new things but other parts of me know this would be just to check off some boxes and i’d be back to square one anyway.

I feel like i have no purpose and i waste my free time trying to figure out who i am instead of being able to BE who i am. I just want the world to pause until i figure it the fuck out so i dont waste another day feeling like this. this has been going on for probably a decade now.

So I started dancing because it’s the first thing I wanted to do, I’m usually never a softy like this, and I’m a little embarrassed to say it, but it’s the happiest I’ve been since well before the epidemic started. Nothing else has matched this, not even my favorite videogame coming out, or my best friends birthday party, just me all alone, dancing Elvis style, like a basement dwelling rat. Something about it felt so liberating, I’ve danced before but never in pure ecstasy like this. To be fair I’m extremely baked.

The voice doesn’t let me continue with hobbies either once I get good at them because I could be getting better at something else I’m not good at now.

ej29di,Anxiety,I don't understand how people work 40+ hours a week for 45+ years of their lives,"I (23f) am American. I don't know if it is just me, but I am horrified by the thought of working all day every day until I can finally afford to retire (if that ever happens). My current job isn't hard, but it sucks the life out of me. Every weekend is too short, and every work week is too long. I never feel like I am rested enough or that I have enough time to do the fun things I like to do. I don't feel like I have hobbies anymore, and I certainly don't have very many friends. I feel like I have to spend all of my ""free time"" keeping my apartment together or resting to try and prepare for the following week.

I don't know how people do this for the majority of their lives, and I especially don't know how people manage to do this while also raising children. I think of all the things I want out of life, including children, traveling, homeownership, and everything else that comes with that, and I don't see how it is possible for those things to happen working full time. I don't even make enough money to do those things, much less have the vacation time. I'm working on budgeting and building my savings, but the math never seems to work out in a way that feels comfortable. I promised myself I would see Europe before I hit 25 and I don't think that's a realistic goal anymore.

I get stuck in this spiral of ""am I just lazy"" and start to get worried that it is only me. Maybe, somehow, I am the only adult who cannot handle working full time and isn't happy about this being my life for the next 45 years. Sometimes I feel ungrateful. My life is fine - I have a roof over my head and food to eat. I am privileged in terms of the type I work I do. Sure, it is mind numbing and often anxiety-inducing, but it is a job that pays enough for me to stay alive. That's better than a lot of people can say. 

Can someone tell me it isn't just me? Or maybe give me a reality check that it is? I just don't know how I can keep this up for another 45 years. I'm so tired.

Edit: I've taken some time to go through all the comments (though I didn't expect so many) and have really appreciated a lot of the advice i've been given! It's great to feel not as alone in this discomfort, and I think I have some ideas and goals on how to improve my situation in this new year. Thank you all so much."

Edit: 
Wow! This community never ceases to impress me! Thank you all for your amazing suggestions and ongoing support, I’m truly touched by everyone’s suggestions. I made a list of the suggestions I’ve received so far to consolidate them all in one place for an easy reference guide. I’ll try to add more as I see them and catch up with comments:

- Develop a consistent sleep schedule / routine 
- Incorporating exercise into routine 
- Drinking herbal teas before bed 
- Using a weighted blanket
- Reading  
- Journaling 
- Listening to podcasts (some are also dedicated to helping you fall asleep!)
- Watching / having something on something in the background until you fall asleep
- Alternatively, limiting screen time (phone or television) before bed 
- Diffusing essential oils / spraying pillow before bed
- YouTube videos of distant sounds or ambient sounds
- ASMR videos
- Taking melatonin or Calm (Magnesium Citrate) before bed
- Yoga and meditation in combination or separately 
- Self-care routine before bed 
- Dedicating “worry time” and trying to talk yourself out of the anxious thought spiral early on
- Trying to dedicate your bed for sleep, rather than hanging out there when you aren’t sleepy 
- Taking CBD before bed
- Limiting caffeine and alcohol 

We are not alone. We are strong. We are loved. We will get through this."

9nmosq,Anxiety,My best friend became a mass murderer. I’ve never been the same since that day.,"So, this is a really hard topic to talk about for me. It’s been several years, about 6, and while I’ll forget about what happened, the generalized anxiety it brought still never goes away.   

First off for context, I’m just gonna show who the serial killer was. It was a pretty big story in my state and really big on YouTube if you spent any time on there in 2012.  

[Mr. Anime](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.texasmonthly.com/articles/disturbing-new-details-emerge-about-man-arrested-in-familys-murder/amp/).       

Anyways, I woke up today with a comment from a video on YouTube that I posted on. It was a web documentary that someone did on him, and I thought it was a nice way to get some of this off my chest. Of course, this really didn’t help, and I ended up super anxious. People taunting me about it and all sorts of troll behavior you get in YouTube comments.   

A little backstory: I grew up with Trey from the age of 12 until he killed his family when I was 22. I had been in contact and hung out with him up until like 3 months before he did the act. He cut contact with me around then which I’m pretty sure he either didn’t want to subject me to that or something.   

When I say we were best friends, I mean we were BEST friends. I spent the night at his house 3 times a week. We had all night WoW gaming sessions, his mom would cook us lunch and dinner so we didn’t even have to stop raiding. His family was so good to me, they were basically a second family. I was in his first ever YouTube video, and I continued making shorts and sketches with him, and even helped with a couple of his anime reviews when he specialized his channel. 

When he moved to his grandparents house in Hempstead, I visited often, and we made it kind of a party house. He filled his cabinets with liquor and he loved playing the host whenever I came back from college to visit. We definitely indulged in pot and prescription meds, but we were young and stupid. I didn’t do drugs outside of our weekend chill sessions, and I didn’t realize he had been addicted to those and alcohol.  

The thing about Trey is he always was pretty secretive. If I ever asked him much about his life or his relationship with his parents, he’d try to change the subject. Don’t get me wrong, I knew a lot about him, more than his other friends, but it took a lot of work by me to get him to open up. Many a night smoking weed and me opening up about my feelings before he finally did about his dissatisfaction with life, his lack of a higher education, and his fathers disappointment in him. I would always try to cheer him up and make him feel better and it seemed to work.   

When the murders happened, I didn’t even know what to do. My girlfriend at the time comforted me, but I was just...numb. I literally didn’t feel anything. Then, my roommate at the time was like “oh let’s smoke a bowl that’ll cheer you up!” And that was when I had my first panic attack. I’m talking full on “I’m gonna die oh my god.” This went on for nearly 2 days. Constantly pacing and checking my heart rate. I couldn’t sleep or eat and felt like I was going insane. I actually packed up and drove to Dallas (I lived in Austin) to go to my moms because I didn’t know what to do, and she had a Xanax prescription and gave me one and I slept for nearly 20 hours.   

I’ve struggled with anxiety for years now. I learned it’s caused by PTSD from the events. I have no health insurance so I can’t really go to therapy unless I foot the entire bill so it really sucks, this is my only way to talk about it honestly other than friends who don’t really understand. No one really understands. My dad thinks I should just get over it, shit happens, but he’s never had his fucking best friend kill his second family! A family that was honestly nicer than his real family, who treated him with love and respect and not judgement.  

Anyways, sorry for the erratic writing or if it jumps around a lot. I’m kind of in a panicked mindset because I got triggered by all the memories of Trey. It’s hard for me to organize my thoughts when I get into this mindset. It feels like I can’t focus on any thought and my mind is just swimming and it leaves me confused. If anyone has any questions I’d love to answer, but I’d also love some advice and support. 

Thanks for reading.   

Edit; 

Everyone that responded thank you so so much. You have no idea how much this means to me. I’m in this weird place between joy and guilt that this got so many comments. Joy because I realized people care so much about a random person, and guilt because I feel I don’t deserve that compassion.  
Yes I know that’s stupid but that comes with the anxiety sadly. Like others have said, I feel I may have a bit of survivors guilt because I learned I was actually a target of his, and I read and article by someone yesterday where he did an interview with Texas rangers. Supposedly when he was 13 he was considering killing one of his friends. I know that friend was me. I remember that day because we were playing with guns as country kids will do and I remember him aiming in my general direction but kind of doing a “haha I got you” thing that he loved doing.   

Anyways, I’m trying to respond to everyone, but I work 11am-11pm the next 2 days (yay service industry). So if I haven’t responded yet, I will definitely try. I’ll be going back to my inbox and on this post and trying to get to everyone. Thank you for taking the time to share and care seriously. "

jcwbws,Anxiety,I WENT TO A PARK BY MYSELF,"I’m a 26 y/o and for the first time since high school I was able to go for a walk at a public park by myself! 

Last December I tried to take my life because of my social anxiety and depression. 10 months later I was able to conquer my fears! 

I took advice from a friend as my anxiety was starting to feel uncontrollable. I started to drive to the park every morning, but couldn't get out of the car. I continued driving there every morning to attempt to make myself more comfortable with my surroundings. The morning I got out of the car I was feeling scared stepping out of the car, but as I started walking a sense of pride came over myself. I was so happy I made it this far that I continued to walk and walk and walk and got to experience a joy in myself that was long overdue!

I started to get into a routine, journaling (writing three things I love about myself, + and - things that happened throughout the day, three short term goals I want to accomplish), walking, meditating, etc. I’m just so darn proud of myself! 

One baby step at a time!

However, my anxiety makes it SO hard to do that sometimes, and the guilt of doing ‘relaxing’ things when I should be doing other things, and my lack of ability to concentrate, my angry thoughts, all tend to sweep up that day full of potential and curb stomp it on the ground. I end up crying, getting nothing done, and also not being able to relax, so then I’ve wasted a day and now I feel 100x worse about myself.

Having a friend or my SO coming over at noon? That's right, trying not to vomit all morning and getting super bloated! By the time they arrive I often feel too sick to enjoy myself.

bl28b0,Anxiety,"Does anyone else constantly feel like the ""pity friend"" and like everyone you know is closer to each other than to you?","This is one of the core issues of my social anxiety. I see the way everyone interacts and there are so many aspects of it that just do not come naturally to me because of how self-conscious I am and how much I try to stay out of everyone's way. People are way physically touchier with each other than they are with me (because being touchy just isn't something I naturally do in platonic relationships, even though I have no problem being touched), people tease each other a lot more and are way better at ~witty banter~ and being sassy with each other than I am and so people treat me weirdly more politely and delicately than they do other people, etc. which like the touching thing is I'm sure just because of how weirdly polite and overly nice I am and they don't want to overstep.

I just always notice that I am treated differently than most, almost like a child to some degree or at least someone who's pretty delicate and sensitive and naive (which I am to some degree, but I think I give off the impression that I am way more than is accurate). I just often end up feeling that I'm only invited to things out of pity more than anything and I somehow self-sabotage and put up boundaries that make it impossible for me to  be as close to others as they are to each other, or at least in the kinds of ways and dynamics with which people usually bond and connect.

I'm not sure how to put all of this into words really, but basically I'm just constantly overanalyzing everyone's behavior and they do treat me differently. They're very NICE, but that's mostly it and that's not really a basis for closeness and comfort with most people. I don't know how to fix it to be more approachable and make people feel more comfortable acting normal with me. I just always feel like I'm not ""in on"" things and just kind of there instead of actually an integral part of any groups. And I always feel like people look down on me and think I'm weird, stupid, oblivious, overly sensitive, childish, or a whole slew of other negative traits."

acpyz0,Anxiety,"This time last year I couldn’t leave my bedroom because of anxiety, today I talked myself down from a panic attack during a surgical procedure.","I’m a 22 year old guy and my anxiety was horrible a year ago. I was unemployed, my life ruled by anxiety. I couldn’t drive, go out with friends, see a movie, and for a while didn’t leave my room. It got so bad I was severely underweight and stayed in a psych hospital for a few days. I began to see a therapist who did CBT 3 times a week, plus saw a psychiatrist and got on the right medication. 

Now I work in a big hospital operating room as a technician full time, I drive all the time, go on dates, and I start school to be an EMT Monday. Today I was assisting during a gastric bypass. I was fully scrubbed in, holding a camera where I have to be dead still, and it’s just me and the 2 doctors, all crammed around this patient. It wasn’t the first time I assisted during this surgery, but it was my first time with this doctor, who’s notoriously vicious, and at one point shit started to hit the fan. The room got silent, tensions where high, and my anxiety skyrocketed. My mask started to fog up and I was sweating, but I can’t touch my face and contaminate my gloves, so I was literally trapped. Then I remembered everything I had learned, I started to focus on my breathing and the work the doctor was doing. I thought to myself encouraging thoughts, and within a minute my anxiety dropped back down, and we ended up completing the surgery. The best part? The doctor told me I did a great job, something even the nurses had rarely ever heard him say to someone. 

The point of this post? To look at where I was a year ago, basically bedridden from anxiety. Now I live a very full life and do things that I want to, not that my anxiety lets me do. You CAN improve and get your life back. If I did it, any of you can do it. The biggest advice I can give is please, get help. I was terrified but it saved my life. I still go to therapy once a month, and I’m still on my medications, and there is absolutely no shame in that. 

I hope this post maybe inspired even one of you. Dealing with anxiety has been the hardest thing I’ve ever done, and I failed at times but didn’t stop trying. No one has to live like this, and no one has to do it alone. I wish everyone here the absolute best of luck conquering your inner demons, and I believe in you. If anyone has any questions feel free to ask, and my PMs are always open to help anyone! "
gmezo7,Anxiety,"Anyone else have ""functioning"" panic attacks where you feel awful, but can otherwise appear totally fine to others?","Apologies in advance for the long post. This is something I've been struggling with for a while, so I'm hoping that by sharing my experience, maybe I can finally legitimize what I've been going through. 

I have been having what I now know to be panic attacks since I was very young. Over the past few years, they have been getting worse and more frequent, and most often crop up when I'm out of the house (especially when I'm at work.) For a long time, I actually wasn't sure that they *were* panic attacks, because my doctors/therapists always described something very different from what I experienced.

Contrary to what I was told by my doctors, I often find that I can function (or at least appear to) perfectly well during a panic attack. My heart is racing, my hands are shaking, my chest feels tight, I feel like my knees will give out with every step I take... and yet I can take a phone call at my desk and sound totally calm and professional. I can greet clients and smile and make small talk, and no one around me can tell that something's wrong. (It's almost like I do these things on autopilot, because later, I find that I usually can't remember much of what happened or what was said.) Afterward, when I don't have to put on my ""brave face"" anymore, I feel physically and emotionally exhausted; the shaking and chills take a long time to subside, and I sometimes cry uncontrollably at trivial things. 

I suppose I should add that a lot of my anxiety rests in not wanting people to be mad at me, or not wanting to let people down. Even when I'm feeling really anxious or depressed, I have trouble asking for the time/space I need to take care of myself because I don't want to upset anyone or make them think I'm incompetent. So, I guess it makes sense that even when a panic attack comes on, I still feel compelled to push those feelings down and force myself to appear ""normal.""

I am pretty wary of speaking to doctors/therapists about these types of attacks, because on more than one occasion, I have been told that I'm totally wrong and they absolutely **cannot** be panic attacks, because if they were, I'd be hyperventilating and I wouldn't be able to control them so well. I feel like they think I'm just being overdramatic and looking for attention. Sometimes it really gets to me, and I start to worry that maybe I *am* just being dramatic and I don't ""deserve"" to call them that because there's nothing wrong with me. It's to the point where even if I'm with someone I trust (i.e. my husband or my mom) I usually don't tell them if an attack comes on because I feel like if I did, they wouldn't believe me; from the outside, I'd appear to be perfectly fine. 

Has anyone else ever experienced anything like this? I feel really alone, so I came to you, people of Reddit, hoping that you can help me find some closure.


EDIT:

Thank you all for your support, advice, and kind words. When I posted this I never imagined it would get this much attention. It’s so wonderfully comforting to know that I’m not the only one going through this."

j8tkja,Anxiety,Stop telling me everyone has anxiety!,"I understand anxiety is a common thing and happens to everyone. But it’s still an incredibly invalidating thing to hear. I’m not sure everyone spends over half an hour picking out an outfit, can’t get on the bus by themselves because they’re irrationally afraid of pulling the stop cord wrong, or overthink everything, down to how long they should toast their bread for.

I don’t think I’m some special case or anything, I know many have it much worse. I often excuse my constant worrying by prefacing to someone that I have anxiety, and hate when they just say “oh well everyone has anxiety”. 

I know that, but sometimes, I wish someone would just say “thank you for telling me.” 

Sorry for the rambling to whoever actually read this.

EDIT: Thank you all so much for responding to my little rant. I’ve been cooped up in my apartment because of COVID feeling very much alone. I’m glad to know I am not alone in how I feel :-)

EDIT2: wow, I was shocked when just a few people replied. thank you everyone for commenting. i do want to say I feel no malice towards those who comment those things about anxiety, but I also think it goes to show how important mental health education is. I know when people say these things they come from a good place :)"

It has ruined my mood the whole weekend, I feel so nervous and down and on edge. 

I just want to call in sick forever and hide in bed...

I hate lying in bed at night wide awake worrying about the morning... I hate the feeling of worrying about not sleeping and it making the situation worse. 

Has anyone found a way to combat sinday blues / work anxiety after time off? 

Sending love to everyone else facing Monday...

*Edit: thank you everyone for your kind messages and replies. I love the phrase ""Sunday Scaries"", I'll be using that! 

I survived the night (barely)... horrible nights sleep. 

I think I will start trying meditation. Even though I am on medication that helps my anxiety,I have so much trouble switching my brain off at night. 

We can do it! 💙"
hfzht4,Anxiety,"Today at 22 years old, I took my first driving lesson and didn't have a panic attack!","I drove a sensitive car, went over speed bumps, through tight islands, and I nearly hit a curb but kept on going! I was told I did well for my first lesson! I'm so happy you guys."
fbq6n2,Anxiety,Does anyone ever feel like they are extremely lonely but are also the one isolating yourself? (Ex: not going outside your house for days but also declining any offers to go out?),"Hi. I’ve struggled with this on and off since I was a young teen. I grew up in the suburbs with immigrant parents and one older sibling who was always out with huge groups of friends or gfs and never home. My parents never ever went out (socializing felt like a burden to them, didnt have too many friends, couldn’t spend too much money) holidays were just another day at home, never anything special. it wasn’t until the last decade now that all kids are grown and they’re retired that they started traveling the world and taking up hobbies and making friends. When I was a kid and I complained about feeling cooped up at home, they couldn’t relate to my anxiety. I always felt like my close friends always had “other groups” of friends or huge families where there was never a weekend or day they’d be home moping. always had groups of friends besides our core friend group, so on random occasions where every person was occupied, it always hit me how extremely lonely I feel.

now, as an adult it still hits me here and there. Everyone knows I’m an extreme introvert and love being home. but lately I’ll be home for 3-4 days straight, can’t bring myself to leave my 1000sq ft apt I live alone in to get the mail, take out trash, or drive to run errands as my simple “socialization for the day.” I have a bunch of things I could be doing outside, errand-wise, or at home (chore-wise, ex: decluttering closets, getting some freelance projects done, job hunting, etc.) but instead I can’t bring myself to do any of them and fixate on my loneliness. 

I let the dishes pile up, eat junk food/instant ramen, just waste hours on YouTube or the internet, sit around crying for no reason, and when people text me to hang out I decline. I don’t understand what’s going on with me, it’s like I’ve reached such a level of being a slob that I can’t bring myself to get ready in 20 min to go outside and hang. My family will even ask to have dinner or something, and the thought of having to coordinate 3 different parties and choose a restaurant and think about 5 hours of productivity I won’t get back (though let’s be real, I won’t be doing anything productive) gives me extreme anxiety.

I’m torn between wanting to bask in solitude and being miserable being so lonely. Can anyone at all relate or is this an issue specific to me since childhood? Am I just a lazy POS and that’s my problem?"
92wrpf,Anxiety,Does anyone just randomly start thinking about bad shit that happened years ago?,I do it periodically 
hfk86k,Anxiety,Anyone else suffer from driving anxiety?,"Seriously, I don’t understand how people aren’t absolutely terrified of driving. You’re inside a three-ton metal death machine surrounded by other death machines, all speeding down a narrow strip of concrete in close proximity to one another. One tiny slip up, just the slightest bit of drift, could kill or horribly maim you and everyone else around you. If you do cause a crash, you could be left dead, debilitatingly injured, or with a lifetime of guilt for hurting someone else.

I hate seeing people get mad at me when I make a mistake. I hate wincing in fear when I have to squeeze between a parked car and the opposite lane, praying I don’t hit someone. I hate when people tailgate me when I’m at the speed limit or slightly above. When I see children walking dangerously close to the road I’m terrified they’ll trip and end up under my wheels, with me not having time to brake. There are so many variables and the risks are so high. How people enjoy it is beyond me.

Anyone else feel like this?"
euub8p,Anxiety,This might be a silly thing for some people but I made a phone call!!!,I have extreme anxiety with the phone. I don't know but it stresses me out.

Please tell me that I’m not alone

TLD;R I get physical reactions to thoughts

Edit: We got a nameee for ittt!!! It is called “cringe attacks” and you can find it on google! thanks u/Thy_Introvert

Edit 2: it’s most likely a form of intrusive thoughts. We all have stupid crazy thoughts, that’s ok and very normal. What may indicate a problem is when the existence of this thought begins to persist, bother you, affect your mood, your life or relationship with people. Having the though is no problem but your *reaction* to the though might indicate something bigger like OCD. Please stay safe and consult a professional if you think it indicates a deeper issue❤️"

amqy1o,Anxiety,Having a long term anxiety disorder is being happy and confident for more than 2 days and then considering if it’s mania because it’s so unusual.,"Honestly this happened to me, if you read my posts you’ll know I’m mostly recovered from having panic attacks and worrying about everything (6 months without a major panic attack woohoo!) I’ve come a long way with keeping on top of my diet, exercising regularly and forcing myself to be social with family and friends. 

But I’ve been crazy happy the last couple of days due to finally quitting a job that made me miserable. Feeling confident and happy to be social and chat more to friends. I’m not used to feeling anymore than content for a few hours so to feel ecstatic for a few days made me feel like I was going crazy haha. 

It goes to show I’m not used to any emotions in their extremes, including happiness.  I feel like true comfort is being in a ‘meh’ mood. 

After talking to a therapist in the past about this it’s actually very common, chronic anxiety disorders basically put all your energy into coping with one extreme emotion and when you recover it sometimes unveils a tendency to feel very uncomfortable with emotions you did not previously express... like anger, confidence, and happiness. And was actually a trigger for one of my relapses... I was convinced I was an aggressive person that was dangerous because in around 10 years of my youth i did not express anger, not because it was repressed, but because anxiety was my default reaction to everything! I’m not an angry person.. and after a lot of CBT I’ve come to accept all emotions that make us unique and often very confused people! I’m allowed to be happy. I’m allowed to be angry... and anxiety is ok in small doses too. "

&#x200B;

Anxiety held me back and lead to me missing things like football games and prom. It got so bad that I had to get home tutors for two years because I couldn’t even manage to leave my house. For awhile I considered dropping out because I literally believed it was impossible to continue. But I couldn’t be more proud right now. I’m IN school for senior year, I WILL be attending my graduation ceremony, and I AM GOING TO COLLEGE!!! Hell yeah!!! So if anyone feels like giving up, trust me if I can get into college with my attendance record looking the way it is, you can do pretty much anything.

Every time I get even into the smallest of debates, I'll *always* feel like the bad guy, even if I didn't cause it or even if I'm right. I hate making people upset so I'd rather admit I'm wrong (even if I'm not) or apologise just so it pacifies the other person. I always visualise fake or past arguments in my head where I say what I actually wanted to say and it makes me feel angry but it's also empowering because I'm saying what's on my mind without the consequences of saying it for real.

l5405p,Anxiety,"Does anyone else talk to themselves and have conversations in your mind all day, everyday?","I tend to over think EVERYTHING from having to plan my trip to the store to my boyfriend not cuddling me before we go to sleep leaving me crying because I think he doesn’t love me anymore. It affects me so much in my life when sometimes it’s not even worth it, it’s just me entertaining a unrealistic thought. Everyday from the moment I wake up till I go to sleep I am talking to myself in my brain mostly it speaks negatively it makes me overthink everything I do. I am at the point where I know I am overthinking and entertaining unrealistic ideas but once it’s in my mind I can not get it out. I get these thoughts that somehow get into my mind and I won’t let go of it and keep digging at it and keeping the topic wondering in my mind all day or for days even. It can be something so small and I can’t focus on anything else but that one thing or something multiple things. I have tried to explain this feeling to people close in my life, I try to explain it as having multiple tabs open on your browser and you are running through the tabs clicking and opening every tab as if you are rushing a last minute research assignment jumping from tab from tab. Whenever i explain my over thinking they tell me “you’re just making yourself over think, you’re doing this to your self just stop overthinking” which makes no sense to me!! How can I just stop thinking?? i would love to but my brain is just always running. This happens even when I am trying to go to sleep which makes sleeping soo hard i have gone to the doctor for insomnia and depression but I have never thought these are the results and side effects of having tons of anxiety. It’s all a dangerous cycle I have fell in for years. Although at first i remember it being mostly depression and feeling of helplessness but these days it’s not even me getting anxious from being depressed because I wouldn’t say I’m depressed anymore but I just anxious, more than I ever have been. So I’m starting to see maybe it’s anxiety that is the stem for most of my other problems. I’m so tired of it effecting my everyday life. If you have any tips for making your mind not be so loud and controlling please leave comment I am so tired of letting myself bring myself down every single day."
eyv4nd,Anxiety,Today im 96 days clean and sober,
l5ao32,Anxiety,hidden ways you’re keeping your body in fight or flight mode,"1. tongue cemented to the roof of your mouth? not only are you tensing your jaw, you’re constricting the muscles in your throat. this can make it feel like it’s closing, and can make you swallow more air which in turn can make your stomach hurt. let your tongue rest.

2. head feel heavy as hell? kinda dizzy and wobbly? like a band wrapped around your head?
tension headaches. your neck doesn’t wanna hold up your head anymore. before freaking yourself out. focus on your neck and shoulder muscles, are they sore as hell? move your neck around. drop your shoulders. massage them. watch how fast your head clears up.

3. feel gassy? like you need to burp or fart or something? you just might. get on your knees, put your ass in the air and relax that butt. drink club soda. do yoga. being too gassy can keep an anxious person in fight or flight. 

4. speaking of butts, are you clenching your butthole really tight for no reason? mhm. your body thinks it’s in danger. relax that thing.

5. let your damn tummy hang out. no one cares. give your guts some room to breathe. then breathe WITH that tummy, not your chest.

6. PLEASE. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD. BREATHE OUT. DEEP BREATH OUT. HOLD YOUR BREATH. 
THEN BREATHE IN. YOU SHOULD BE BREATHING IN HALF AS LONG AS YOU BREATHE OUT. YOUR LUNGS KNOW WHAT TO DO, BREATHE RIGHR FOR THEM.


you can’t relax your mind if your body is not relaxed. check these off. then calm your mind. i hope they help. ❤️


Edit: regarding #1, i did NOT think i would have to point this out because i believe in the intelligence you guys have but, your tongue naturally sits on the roof of your mouth. by saying “cemented” i tried to relay that putting an unnecessary amount of pressure on the roof of your mouth can keep you in fight or flight or tense. not just lightly holding it there. again, thought my choice of words put that message across. i apologize to Mew zealots everywhere. thank you."

I followed the advice y'all gave me after my last interview and had a ""fake it till you make it"" approach to all interactions with this employer.  I made dog puns in my first e-mail, joked a bit on the phone, and made the whole process fun for myself (which, it turns out, made it fun for everyone else too!).  My anxiety is going to be much, much lower now knowing 1) that I actually have a full time job, 2) that I'll be doing what I love, and 3) It's less than 15 minutes from my new home.

What will I be doing, you ask?  Working with DOGS!  I love, Love, LOVE dogs and have worked professionally with them for a couple of years previously.  I'll mostly be playing with them in small groups, although there will be cleaning and bathing as required (I love giving them baths!).

I feel the complete *opposite* of what I felt going into that second interview at last week.  In every way.  I'm confident, too...  That's rare for me.  Thanks, anxiety.  Seriously, though...

People still DM me looking to talk because of it. So many people just need to be heard. And so, here I am again. :) I plan on making this a more regular thing, maybe once a week. I need to clarify that I am NOT a doctor or a practicing psychologist, if you feel like you need urgent help, please please talk to a professional. They really do help.

k9z01h,Anxiety,GOT A 100 ON MY STATS FINAL,"This was my first semester back at college after I overdosed on xanax from how anxious I was...I spent three and a half hours on my stats final, heart beating out of my chest and crying for almost the entire thing, running back and forth to the bathroom feeling like I was about to throw up...and I just got my grade back and...

I got a perfect score!! And an A in the class!! 

Don’t let anxiety hold you back, you can do anything!"
lhv5i1,Anxiety,Does anyone else always think they've done something wrong?,"Hi all. I just wanted to vent a little here. When it comes to messaging, I always feel like I've done something to offend my friends or something. Like, if they dont respond to my messages after a while, I start to feel like I did something wrong and now they hate me. Or whenever I call and they dont answer, I feel like they dont want to talk to me anymore. The obvious and logical answer is that they're busy, but anxiety doesn't give a fuck about logic. Right now, one of my friends hasn't messaged me back in about a week, and my anxiety just tells me stuff like, ""What if they're not busy and just ignoring me because they hate me."" That's my biggest anxiety problem right now. And then I start to get worried that I'm too clingy and that makes my anxiety worse, making me hate everything. Does anyone else get this, and if so, how do I fix it?"
c9u0iv,Anxiety,Anyone else just likes to retreat to bed when things go bad?,"I just love laying in bed i normaly should be doing other stuff but bed makes me comfortable

fxc59w,Anxiety,Remember the 25% rule for social anxiety.,"25% of people will like you and nothing you can do will make them not like you.

25% of people won’t like you and nothing you can do will make them like you.

25% of people will like you but something you do could make them not like you.

25% of people won’t like you but something you do could make them like you.

You can’t really tell who is who in most cases and you have no control over who they are and how they react to you.

So it doesn’t make sense to try and figure it out or try to control it, just let it go. Someone’s reaction or perception of you is not your fault, just do your best and don’t let yourself get caught up using your imagination to guess what people are thinking about you.

Let me repeat the last part.

Don’t waste time and energy worrying about or assuming you know what anyone is thinking about you, using your imagination is most likely not accurate at all and especially if you have anxiety it can’t be trusted anyways.

You don’t need to respond to anything immediately, you don’t need to go out of your way to make sure someone doesn’t think the wrong thing in the majority of situations. It just doesn’t matter and it’s OK for people to be wrong!

So take a load off your mind and don’t let your imagination get the best of you."

But I had a pep talk in the bathroom mirror with myself and just said, fuck it, let’s fucking do this. 

To anyone who feels like they can’t do something. Don’t rush yourself, take all the time you need to prepare yourself mentally but I promise you, you all have it in you to do whatever scares you. If I can, anyone can. And when you do, omg the high is incredible.

dk2os9,Anxiety,Does anyone else stay up all night because they're nervous about the next day?,I don't mean like not being able to fall asleep because you're nervous but just every night purposely staying up so that the morning will arrive slower. Idk how to explain it but I stay up till like 7am every night because I don't want the next day to be here yet. I also stay up because I feel like I have so much to do before going to sleep but then I end up procrastinating it and not doing it and staying up for no reason. idk maybe someone can relate?

So the whole 60 minutes was spent saying: “what? Can you repeat that?” *garbled unintelligible speech* “I’m sorry I missed it again could you say it again” ect ect.

Was checked for nearly everything. 

I get a physical fog feeling in my head, my thoughts aren't really cloudy, but I just feel weird in my head, I feel slightly dizzy, and just all around ""out of it"" like I am on a drug I guess is the best way to describe it. It is really hard to describe. I feel a bit dizzy and disoriented, but not enough that I can't do things like drive, walk a straight line, etc. I had surgery about a year ago and the week leading up to it I had this feeling because I was so nervous. It is a super concerning feeling, and as it's caused by stress, stressing about it only makes it worse. Does anyone else get this odd feeling?"

Edit: You guys are the best! I don't have a lot of people to share the news with and you guys have been great! Thank you so much for all the kind words, congratulations, and the awards. This has really made my day.

To those of you who are in the same situation I was in, just practice as much as you can and make yourself do it! You could even do a mock test with the person teaching you to drive. Just go to the place where you plan to take the test and drive exactly like you would during the test. You can have your teacher tell you where to go and end it with parallel parking somewhere. It will make you less nervous during the real test if you feel like you've done it before. Plus, you won't be taken surprise by driving in an unfamiliar area. 

Be sure to know where everything is in the car you are going to be taking, they ask you to turn on emergency flashers, point out the parking break, turn signals, wipers, etc. This is all dependant on where you live, but it couldn't hurt to know of course. 

And my last tip, be sure to pay attention to road signs. Two different times during the test, the lady pointed out signs we had just passed and asked me what they were/what they said. It's easy to forget or miss signs that aren't that important to you, but pay attention during the test at least!"
in42ki,Anxiety,Does anyone else get anxiety about getting older and aging??,I know there is nothing we can do about it but I still can’t wrap my head around it that we just grow old and die.
iicu6b,Anxiety,Anyone else panic when someone near them is angry or possibly angry?,"I notice that when someone in the same space as me is angry or shows signs of anger, I become extremely on edge. I start to shake, I get the urge to cry or run/hide and I go completely mute, unable to look that person in the eye or talk to them, kind of in fear of getting in their way and having them take it out on me (though not always). Something as small as that person sighing really loudly, or someone slamming or dropping something sends me into a panic. It takes me a really long time to calm down too. I assume this is from my social anxiety? But I haven’t heard of this in anyone else with social anxiety. I keep googling it but each time I end up with nothing, so I decided to ask/post here. Is this an anxiety disorder thing? Do other people experience this? Or am I just weird? :/

l0jx6p,Anxiety,Anyone else wake up hours early for things only to lay awake doing absolutely nothing for as long as possible?,"I can’t believe I never put 2 and 2 together and thought of this as a way that my anxiety manifests. For as long as I can remember I have done this, I like to wake up super early for things and just lay there doing nothing because I feel like sleeping all the way until the stressful event is too fast and if I just lay there awake I can savor every second that I have of not doing the thing. 

I used to do this every morning before work when I had a job I didn’t like. I did it all the time for school especially in middle school. I just did it for my first day of classes this semester and I’m a senior in college. Woke up at like 3:30 for no reason and never even tried to go back to sleep. Just laid there under my blanket trying to keep my mind as blank as possible and enjoy the nothingness before my day. 

Also, sorry if this has been posted a million times, anxiety is something I’ve long been diagnosed with but I have always avoided it and only now am I starting to try to share about it and confront it little by little."

k4xqa9,Anxiety,"Whatever you do, don’t believe the thoughts your anxious mind brings","I’m probably gonna delete this post later cuz of my anxiety but just wanted to give a reminder to you guys.

When your anxious, your mind thinks the worst possible scenario, not the most REALISTIC scenario. The worst possible scenario could have a <1% chance of being true but it doesn’t feel like that in the state of anxiousness.

It’s a trap, it feels like you’re gonna be stuck like this forever, which inevitably gives you more anxiety and now you’re stuck in a loop.

Its easier said than done but learning to accept that the worst case scenario can happen seems to be the best way to deal with anxiety.

Again, you’re thinking about the most unlikely, worst case scenario. No, you’re not going to go crazy, you aren’t gonna have a heart attack, your life isn’t ruined forever, you’re intrusive thoughts won’t clog your mind forever.

This chest tightness, cloudy brain feeling won’t last forever, but it doesn’t go away by itself, you gotta put in the effort. Hope this helps!"
fiuc1o,Anxiety,I adopted a kitten and ive been bawling because i love him so much.

Lately at times I've felt a lack of empathy and alot of anxiety, but when I saw him I thought of how small he is and how I cant wait to be a dad. And I had a ton of anxiety regarding whether I set up his safe room well and if I would do something wrong and all that. All is going well so far, but just sitting here with him seeing how beautiful he is, and releazing how much I really do love him, I've just been crying my eyes out. Idk if this is weird or not.

g78nn7,Anxiety,I was the only student to join the video chat this morning.,"Since we transitioned to online classes, my Spanish professor still wanted to meet with us so we could continue to practice speaking Spanish. When we first started doing this, I wondered what would happen if only one person showed up, and now I know. 

This morning, I was the only student that joined the call for the majority of the session. Another student joined about 10 minutes before the call was supposed to end. It didn't make me panic as much as I thought it would, but I did kinda panic a little bit whenever it took me too long to answer some of the activities.

I did get the chance to have a little bit of a one on one lesson to practice using words in the past tense. We have an Oral Interview coming up soon and I needed the practice because I will have to talk in the past tense. 

It also made me feel a little better about making mistakes (learning a second language is very hard). My professor was very patient when I took a little bit longer to answer some of the questions and was helpful when I couldn't remember some words. It made me feel a little more confident and if I stay focused, I think I'll be able to get a lot of my schoolwork done today. I have two assignments due later today and I feel confident that I'm gonna get them done and turned in today."

azrmao,Anxiety,I just got fired on my first day and I don't know what to do,"I have an anxiety disorder and often get panic attacks. I just got fired from my new job as a cashier in a supermarket. Sitting in the toilet room of a big shopping centre crying as I am typing this. This was my first real job since I finished school in may last year. So today was my first day and it all started really bad. Every bread and vegetable has its own number which I have to type into the cash register. I don't know any of them so I have to look everything up on a piece of paper. That takes a while and I'm not really comfortable with that cash register as I never used something like that before. It took me quite some time to get through each customer and I often had to call another worker to come help me. The line at my register got bigger and bigger. We have 3 cashiers but for some reason all the customers were in my line and my coworkers didn't really care. Then there was that older gentleman, I accidentaly typed in the wrong number for his bread, I apologized and called for a coworker. The man got really annoyed and started to yell at me, I didn't know what to do. The other customers just stared angrily at me and started to express how slow I am. At that point I was close to crying and I got a panic attack. Finally my boss came and explained he doesn't want me here and that I need to pack my stuff and leave. So yea, I don't know what to do, my parents are going to kill me. I'm lost, I can't even have a normal job for a day. 

I hope this is readable as english isn't my first language and I'm still pretty nervous about everything.

Edit: Thank you for your kind words, I really appreciate it. I called some people and have a job interview this friday at a place I like

97ax1b,Anxiety,When you’re so used to feeling anxious that being calm and relaxed feels like a high,"I’ve been feeling very calm and relaxed recently, and because I was so accustomed to confusion and worry, mainly due to not having a clue how to behave socially and being fearful of having a meltdown whenever I’m at work and people all talk at me at once, being in such a calm state felt like, to me, I was high. As in, stoned or dosed up on benzos. I should mention I didn’t actually take anything. Who else has noticed this? It made me realise how intrusive and disruptive anxiety actually is, and that despite letting it exist, it’s way too much of a plastic bag over my head to ignore, which is why I am going to make more of an effort to counter it instead of living with it.

k6xeog,Anxiety,I've learned that one of the best ways to overcome anxiety is to listen and take care of your body. It is the only boss.,"I'm 25F and I have anxiety. Obsessive and intrusive thoughts. Panic. Paranoia. Constant worry. Incapacity of joy and calmness. All this in a loop. All of this makes me forget about my body. So it accumulates a huge amount of stress.

When my body is relaxed, my mind follows it.

I always forget about this. Always. And if I remember I don't do anything about it because I'm too busy worrying about shit.

Take a deep, really deep deep breath. Hold it. Let it go.

Dance.

Take warm or cool baths.

Comb your hair.

Drink lots of water.

Stretch.

Take sunbathes.

Hydrate your skin.

Put your feet on scented water.

Run.

Ride a bicycle.

Cry.

Walk on the rain.

Get a massage.

Feel the wind on your face.

Get a sweet hug from a loved one.



Your mind will follow."
bat8cd,Anxiety,Does anyone else keep thinking about and over-analyzing humiliating events from 10+ years ago?,"I recently had a (sort of sudden) realization that everyone would make fun of me in High School, with me being the joke and the only one not knowing what was going on (even the teacher was in on it...). These moments were ongoing and humiliating - I would almost always play into the joke too. 

I never thought I was popular, but I never realized how big of a loser I was during those years. All of the people who pretended to be my friend were actually making fun of me. I graduated high school over 10 years ago and have become a self-supporting adult now, but still struggle with self esteem. Nonetheless, I'm not sure why this suddenly bothers me. Since HS, I had a pretty successful time in college and am doing well in my career, but still keep going back to these HS thoughts. Has anyone else had this happen, or have any advice?"

You are going to make it through this even if you feel like you aren't.  No matter how alone you feel, its just that, a feeling, in reality you have us all with you. This is not a journey you are taking by yourself.

Crying is not weakness, its emotion. Its empathy and you are blessed to have it in the times in which we live. Its a resource even more precious  than platinum.  We aren't broken, its the world around us that is. We just see it for what it is and care enough for those whom are cold.

Stop being so hard on yourself, you are exactly who you need to be. Don't let a day go by without telling those around you that you love them and learn to accept love from others even if you feel like you don't deserve it. You do, we all do.

One race, the human race. One love.

i7c7t1,Anxiety,Anyone else have super bad anxiety about being late but then the depression sets in and you’re just chronically late to everything cause you don’t care anymore? And then you feel guilty?,"This is going to sound so weird, which is why I really want to see if anyone else feels like this. 

I have awful anxiety and always plan out my routine with at least an hour gap of having to get somewhere. But when the time comes to actually leave the house, I... can’t? Like the ability to get out of bed, to put clothes on, take my pills, to ensure I put some sort of substance into my body... is exhausting and I keep putting it off until I’m literally so late that it makes me hate myself even more. But yet the consequences of my actions aren’t as anxiety inducing now that I realize that I’m late? 

I lay there like “oh I should leave in 10 minutes but I haven’t even gotten up... what is the point?” and then drag myself out of bed, cursing myself for giving in. 

And then the entire time I’m on my way there, my depression hits and I’m beating myself up because DUH, I’m awfully late and now the other party who told me a time to meet up has to wait for my sad, pathetic self to show up. I don’t know what’s wrong with me and I don’t think this is normal? Can anyone relate or am I crazy?"

And all you're trying to do is be kind, be funny, express your love, try and be loved back.

You're just trying to be less lonely. Yet it seems like everyone can't stand you. Either it's true or you're paranoid, neither is good for the mind and soul."
jzw1t3,Anxiety,Does anyone get an uncontrollable amount anxiety before going to bed knowing you have to wake up for work?,"No matter what I do, I always feel sick to my stomach anxious knowing I gotta go to work the next morning. 

Fast forward to the next morning, I’m still anxious, I barely slept. 

I don’t smoke, barely drink but I wanna feel comfortable again.

**Edit**
I didn’t think this would get as much response as it did. 

I’ve watched my father suffer from severe panic attacks for the last 15 years. He had to retire early and it took years for him to get disability. 

I watched him every morning with crippling anxiety to where he throws up. He doesn’t even have to leave the house, as soon as he wakes up he’s sick. He’s been on Xanax for 10-12 years probably. It’s the only thing that helps him. 

As a child who witnessed what severe anxiety and panic attacks can do to a family, I never want any of my family to experience it or anyone else out there. There were times my family only made $400 a month when my dad used to make $2,000 every 2 weeks. 

Anxiety and panic attacks are an internal monster that break people down until they have nothing. It’s crappy, but true. 

Thank you for listening to my story and replying and liking it even. 

If anyone ever needs someone to talk to, I’m always here to talk!"
k59nnf,Anxiety,I called out of work and gave myself a mental health day!,"I really struggle to prioritize my own wellbeing when it comes to work. I'm really scared of being seen as a bad employee. I started a new job a few months ago and it's been incredibly stressful. My anxiety is at an all-time high. So I called out today to give myself a little break. I'm really proud of myself for prioritizing my mental health. Of course, a part of me feela guilty, but I'm trying to redirect my thoughts."

lo5uv7,Anxiety,It’s honestly baffling to me that there are people who approach new experiences without crippling fear,"Seriously. I got a new job and I had my first real task earlier this week. And I spent the *entire* week in and out of anxiety attacks. Couldn’t get out of bed. But also couldn’t sleep. I felt physically ill and wanted to vomit but I couldn’t. I couldn’t eat anything except some bread that I forcefed myself just so that I could take antacids. And all I could do was sob uncontrollably and think of how much I want to die. 

Then the work task I had been dreading happened, and...my symptoms just melted away. It was almost magical. I felt so relieved but also so incredibly stupid. I *knew* nothing seriously bad could happen, that even the worst case scenario was pretty alright. But my body was just convinced I was going to die. It’s like my nervous system is a mechanical bull without an off switch and all I can do is hang on for dear life while it knocks me around and tires itself out. No chance at conversation or understanding, just mindless panic. 

All I want is to punch my anxiety in the face and yell “can we at least talk about this?”"

kaku8r,Anxiety,I reported the doctor who implied I was lying about Anxiety.,"Today after about 4 weeks of sitting on the idea I finally reported the doctor who implied I was lying about Anxiety in an attempt to get out of work while getting paid. 

What that asshole doesn't know is 1.) I was authorized time off for my anxiety and did not need a doctor's note from him. I was genuinely seeking help and 2.) I got a second opinion from someone who took mental health more serious who gave me a doctor's note to stay out of work for 2 weeks and gave me the suggestion to talk to a therapist. 

I return to my new doctor at the end of next week to see if more time is needed or if medication needs to be prescribed for my anxiety and depression. 

Nothing may come of my complaint but, at least I did it!

Edit: I wanted to say I love that this is the the post that got me my first award ever! I also wanted to Thank /u/inevitable_Problem85 as they are the person who told me I should report him!"

I hate using phones to begin with, and it vibrating reminds freaks me out. Nobody should be calling me, so it must be bad. Does anybody else feel this way from a vibrating sound?

Edit: Glad to know I'm not alone in this feeling. Also, a bonus for you: I once used my house phone to call my mobile phone to make sure it was working, and even holding the two phones was enough to raise my heart-rate, I have no idea why."
aipmmi,Anxiety,It took me years to realize my anxiety was anxiety and not just my personality.,"I only came to this realization recently and it's weird that it took so long when anxiety runs in my family. My mom's been hospitalized for panic attacks. I've had depressive bouts but every time I heard someone mention anxiety, my brain was like ""hmmm. Not me."" 

&#x200B;

I though being awkward, nervous, on-edge, and uncomfortable 24/7 was just my personality. I thought my fear of talking to other people and my fear of making phone calls (often to the point of tears) was just me being shy. I thought constant chest tightness and pain was just normal stress. I thought it was normal for the smallest things to be beyond overwhelming. My intense fears of constantly fucking up had been with me for so long that I never thought twice about the rationale behind it. I have ADHD as well and when I thought maybe that was the cause of some of it, but when I got my adderall prescription, I wasn't magically cured of all my uncomfortableness. I was still a nervous, anxious person who also happened to be able to focus better than I used to.

&#x200B;

Two weeks ago, the feelings became stronger than normal. I had aches in my chest for days on end. I was so nervous and on edge--more so than usual. That happened out of nowhere, then an unexpected loss in the family sent me over the edge in terms of panicking. It dawned on me after the worst had passed that maybe this is an anxiety disorder. I did a lot of self-reflecting and realized maybe I've been anxious all my life and I Just never realized it because I thought it was normal.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I don't really know what the point of me typing all this out is, but it just feels good to know maybe there's hope for me. I talked to my doctor and was prescribed zoloft last Friday. I don't know how much it will change me, I know that it's not some kind of magic pill, but just knowing that I'm not alone and that there's a chance to overcome this is so comforting to me.

bcpl83,Anxiety,"Is there anyone else here that makes themselves physically sick (such as vomiting, heartburn, etc) because of their anxiety?","Hi,

I’m new here and I guess I just hope I’m not the only one that deals with this. I’m diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Social Anxiety.  I’ve been making myself physically sick the past week over going to a bridal shower on the weekend. The reason I have the anxiety is just the fear of being judged by others or saying something stupid.  I’ve even been in group therapy (iOP) for weeks to try and find ways to lessen my anxiety, but I just feel  like I took a step back. Yesterday, I was so stressed out about this that I caused myself to vomit even; I’ve had a migraine, some random nausea, and heartburn the last week due to the stress and anxiety too. Is there anyone else who has this happen?"
k36t33,Anxiety,PLEASE DONT POST ABOUT YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS ON SOCIAL MEDIA WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT!!!,"My mom posted several times on her Facebook talking about my recent hospital (psych ward) stay. (I’m 19, was 18 at the time, like it matters anyway, you shouldn’t post anyone’s personal info on social media whether they are your kid as a minor or not) Luckily she didn’t mention the psych ward part but I asked her to take it down because it’s private and no ones business but my own and my doctors but she didn’t so I had to resort to publicly commenting;

“Mom, please take this down. As I said in person I would really prefer it and strongly ask that you dont talk about my mental health or my issues on your Facebook with people whom I don’t know. I love you, and no offense to anyone who’s read this post, but this information is private about me and I do not like that it has been shared without my consent. I understand your concerned for me, but this is no ones business but my own and my doctors. Thank you all for the well wishes, and have a blessed day.” 

Hopefully the embarrassment will get her to take it the fuck down. And before you ridicule me I did what I thought necessary. She needs to learn her place. She can’t go spouting my shit to everyone she meets. I won’t tolerate that shit. I’m not a minor any more, I’m a grown ass adult, and if I didn’t live in her house still she wouldn’t know a damn thing about me anymore. This shit is why I have trust issues.

Edit;
Of course she bitch at me about it and said “take down whatever you want to take down. I’m done with it.” 
I dont care at this point. I did what I had to do."
jwawkx,Anxiety,Anyone else anxious about having to go back to ‘normal’ eventually?,"I feel so selfish for this because I’ve been lucky enough to be able to WFH and quarantine this entire time. 

At the beginning of shelter in place, I was too anxious to even be outside. But now that I’m comfortable going to parks, walking to the beach, hiking, etc., (I still don’t go shopping indoors) I absolutely am dreading going back to work and in-person college. I can’t tell if I’m using COVID as an excuse to socially isolate myself or if I’m genuinely still terrified of catching it/passing it, but I really love my new routine. 

I get to work on my own time without the awkward office chatter, don’t have to spend all day on campus being overly self-aware, I don’t feel obligated to attend social events, it’s honestly amazing. I’ve gotten to work more on meditation & other anxiety coping strategies. I feel so awful for the way I feel because this has been such a difficult & stressful time for so many people."
hkiqsx,Anxiety,Does your anxiety come from your parent/s overreacting to everything?,"I believe mine does. Every little mistake was the end of the world for my single mother who raised me and my siblings. I used to think it was normal to be screamed at and grounded for spilling stuff on the floor as a kid. Until now, as an adult I think it is pretty crazy how my mothers anger could go 0 to 100 that fast over children making stupid mistakes. And yes, I stopped telling my mother about details of my life due to the explosions that would commence. Sucks."

jcfzk4,Anxiety,I did it! I asked for a girls number today.,"I'm a junior in college, and I've never dated or even kissed a girl because of my Social Anxiety Disorder holding me back. I was officially diagnosed at the age of 15, and whenever I tried to date, I could never go through with it. I would seldom try to talk to girls about dating seriously, and when I did, I usually canceled or just chickened out.

But today I was feeling good, I think I had done pretty well at an Exam I was studying all week for, and it was almost the weekend.  I was in the class we're in and kept sneaking glances at her. The feeling in my gut surged when I thought about asking for her phone number. I keep thinking of reasons why I shouldn't, even though I know I wanted to. I finally just told my self ""Screw it, I'm doing it"" and threw caution to the wind, ignoring the feeling in my gut.

I asked her after class was over, and she had me give her my number and texted me afterwards. Idk if anything will come of it, but this felt like a huge milestone for me!

UPDATE: I texted her some, but she seldom replied, and even when she did, she didn't very interested. I don't think anything will come out of this, but this was a huge milestone for me and I'm proud of myself nonetheless!"

8e6gsp,Anxiety,To anyone else who's having a self sabotage day,"This goes out to everyone who's spent the day laying in your bed, scrolling theough reddit for the past 8 hours because you can't handle today, or don't have the motivation to get up. To everyone who's had a panic attack or indulged in something you shouldn't have.

 I want to send you a message of support in this sea of frustration, panic, and uncertainty. I wish I knew the exact words to help everyone who's in one of these positions today, to be able to make a positive impact in your life, and give you solace. Unfortunately, I can't, but I want you to know that mistakes and slip ups don't define you. Sometimes anxiety is so powerful it feels the only way to drown it out is to mindlessly scroll on your phone, or to have that beer you said you wouldn't have. Being on this subreddit in the first places means you have made a conscious decision to seek support and self improvement. You can get through these days, and if you feel like you can't, please seek out professional help. You are worth it. 

 I had one of those self sabotage days today. My social anxiety has been crippling, I skipped the gym, smoked those cigs I planed to toss out, and spent today watching youtube videos instead of doing my work. I know that on these days seeing a post like this would help me, and that's why I'm writing this, so people in my situation today can see that they aren't alone this Sunday. 

Cheers to making it though these nasty days, and to here's to knowing we'll get through this. 

Edit: This post blew up more than I thought! I wish I could reply to all of you, but I'm super busy prepping for exams (that's right, today's not a self sabotage day like yesterday). I feel so happy that what I've said has helped people. S/o to the awesome community here, and to my fellow anxiety sufferers for being so welcoming and supportive to each other. Let's make today great!"

Someone has the audacity to comment and tell me to “get over it” because I’m in college now. I can’t tell you how much that pissed me off. 

Okay, miss rising high school junior, why don’t you take my social anxiety and depression with you? See how it feels and how difficult it is to simply “get over it”. Social anxiety is a real mental health issue. Jesus Christ, you think being one of those “chance me for college admissions, I take my studies seriously” people would actually have a brain cell and some empathy. 

People don’t take mental health seriously. This really infuriates me."

imulai,Anxiety,I finished a whole grilled cheese!,"Lately my anxiety has been making it hard to eat full meals/meals at all.

Even my favorite foods would sound good in concept, but be nauseating once set in front of me. Plus I was wasting so much food just trying to eat anything, and I hate things going to waste.

But today my dad made me a grilled cheese for dinner and I ATE THE WHOLE THING! I could feel that terrible stomach feeling trying to overcome me every time I let my thoughts wander, but when that happened I would slow down and take deep breaths and remind myself that everything is ok, then try to distract myself in the dinner table conversation.

Anyways, it’s not much, but it’s the first full meal I’ve been able to finish in weeks and I’m so happy I wanted to share."
ei4t1h,Anxiety,Hey,"I just wanted to say happy new year to all the people in here who suffer from anxiety. I know it's such a hard thing to get over but we are the strong ones, anxiety can't take us away from our beautiful lives. Just keep fighting with it, we'll see better days in 2020. I love you all!"
b25lyk,Anxiety,"Things that helped me manage my anxiety, maybe this can help you too","I am taking Lexapro and doing therapy, but I also made a lot of lifestyle changes have made a huge difference, so I wanted to share my list. 

1. I went completely caffeine free. It's been about a month. I also was having headaches and issues with my blood pressure, both of which are better. I didn't think I'd be able to do this (was having 3 to 4 cups of strong coffee and 1-2 sodas per day) but I feel so much better off it. I drink a lot of decaf tea and water. The first week was rough (headaches!) but I powered through and stuck with it. 

2. I stopped going on Facebook altogether. The whole ""comparison"" crap and drama, don't need it.

3. I don't watch the TV news. Ever.

4. I am not overweight, but I started exercising. My therapist told me this is a great treatment for anxiety and he was right. I just do power walk videos on You Tube, nothing fancy.

5. I eat breakfast every day now (was not doing this before) and started eating more fruits and vegetables.

6. My therapist told me to do more things that I enjoy. So with all the time I have since I'm not on Facebook so much, I am reading books. Light fiction, nothing that stresses me out. I also have been trying to do some of those adult coloring books, but sometimes I get anxious about what colors to use or if my picture will looks good (ridiculous, I know), so that's a process.

7. I have the Headspace app and do some mindfulness. This is really challenging for someone with anxiety I think. Sometimes you don't want to be inside your head too much. But I have found the Managing Anxiety series to be really helpful, with the noting strategies and just acknowledging the anxious thoughts without judging them or trying to run away from them.

8. My therapist also told me to do things that build confidence. So I try to focus on things I'm good at, because baking a delicious cake or doing a good job at my work does help me feel better about myself.

9. I can't say enough good things about therapy and my counselor. This is the first time in my life (I'm 40) that I have taken this step and it is incredibly helpful. If you're struggling with anxiety, think about it. I started with my employer's EAP (employee assistance program) which offered 3 free sessions, and then moved on to a ""real"" counselor because it was so helpful. Look into if your work has this as an option, it's free! 


Recognize that anxiety management is a process, and not just a switch we can turn off. My instinct previously was to try to run away from it. I hated it and I was mad at it. But now I understand that it's part of who I am, I have to accept that and I have to learn how to manage it. Hang in there, friends. You got this.

Edit: thank you for all the kind comments, and for the gold ❤️"
izbcu7,Anxiety,It’s exhausting to be an empathetic person with anxiety,"As someone with pretty bad anxiety who also likes to keep up to date with the news and learn more about things to stay informed and try to be an ally, I find myself emotionally drained because this year is just so much. Is it better to avoid the news and social media when I’m feeling anxious? Because then I get anxiety about having the privilege to have the ability to just not pay attention to certain social justice issues. Either way this year sucks and my anxiety can’t handle it if it gets any worse.

Edit: Thank you so much for all the kindness and thoughtful responses. It really means a lot to me."
fl9afm,Anxiety,"I wish all of the people of this world good health and happiness, and to let you know this virus, will not annihilate us. We will win. Don't get lost in fear.

calvbz,Anxiety,"I’m finally leaving this sub, best of luck to all of you, wish I could hug every single one of you.","After years of battling anxiety and panic attacks, I am finally proud to say I live a life without excessive anxiety, panic and worry.

People who are in these forums are people who need help, which there is nothing wrong with that. Although, I don’t need help anymore! Tons of people have helped me in this sub and given me great comforting advice. Best of luck to all of you and I hope one day soon you too can leave this sub!!!

9a7dpv,Anxiety,I’m so proud of myself. I just started college. I’m a week in. I haven’t had friends to talk to in person in years. I made 4 wonderful friends and they made me so happy last night.,"I didn’t wanna go to this school party/dance event last night.. I don’t know anyone here. Even in high school and my hometown I never had any friends to talk to in person. For years I was alone and only had a few online friends.. 

I’m so glad I decided to fight my social anxiety last night.. I went to the event. After an hour of walking around and standing in the back, I decided to walk over to this small circle that had formed. People were having fun and dancing around. And I ended up sticking around and then eventually one of them said something to me. We started talking and I met the whole group of them. 

Sorry for typing so much lol. I’m just so happy I finally have someone I can talk to in person. It’s amazing and I had a great night. I’m so so glad I decided to go to the event, despite being so anxious and not knowing a soul. This is a huge step for me and it feels amazing. 


**Update:** **She just asked if I wanted to come to her dorm to do homework, I agreed. But I’m instantly regretting this. What have I done.**

**Update 2:** **It was fun. She’s really nice and caring. Even got a hug. My first hug from anyone other than my parents or family in years. Thank you all so so much for your kind words. You’re all amazing!**

**Update 3:** **I’m beginning to worry I’m gonna make them hate me. I feel like I’m so annoying.. I’ve never really had friends in person, other than online friends, and Ive been texting them a lot. They’ve been busy so we can’t talk in person. Has this happened to anyone else? Your mind and anxiety keeps telling you they’re gonna leave and forget you so you have to talk to them a lot and very often so you know they don’t hate you and you can have a little relief? What do I do?.. 


**Update 4 (probably last update):** They we’re just busy. We hung out last night and watched a movie and had fun. Already have plans for Labor Day weekend. I still can’t believe this is happening. This is the best hint that’s happened to me in 3 years. Thank you all so so much for the kind words. You’re all amazing people. "
16mco0,Anxiety,The Mayor of my town posted this on Facebook this morning...great message!,
k8m712,Anxiety,I presented to 80 people on Zoom!,"It was scary at first but I made it through. I suffer from Social Anxiety and doing the 5 minute presentation to 80 people (that went well) made me more confident. When you finish it you think to yourself what the hell was I thinking beforehand, you really become more aware of the cognitive bias"
hs368j,Anxiety,Does anyone else feel like they're constantly in a rush to get things done even when they have nothing else they want to do?,"I don't know if this is anxiety linked or not but Ive always has this sense to rush things. I always want to get things done and completed, even enjoyable things sometimes. 

Like I want to move on to the next thing or I just want to finish things so I can relax.

But then when I have nothing to do I don't have anything I even want to do. I feel like it's really hard for me to just enjoy what I'm doing whether it's good or bad, work or fun, etc. 

I've read of ""Hurry Sickness"" but it feels like that matches people that are actually busy and want to do more things. Im not really a busy person, it's like I'm in a rush to get back to doing nothing."
d7fbot,Anxiety,Anxiety is trying to stop me from going to a car wash so I’m going to the car wash in an act of sheer disrespect towards anxiety,"As the title says, I’ve got “a case of the spooks” where I feel woozy and dizzy and icky about just going to a car wash. As a kid I used to love going,  but now I find the chemically smell kind of difficult to manage. But the car is dirty and I want to do this. 

So now that anxiety has gotten involved, I want to be rude to it. So I’m gonna go get this car clean!

Edit: we got there and there was a line up of 5 cars ahead of us, so I had to double down on anticipatory anxiety too, but I WON. And the car is very pretty now!"
lrhd7x,Anxiety,I no longer have suicidal thoughts,"Well actually I haven’t had it for maybe weeks now, not since January or early February. In my head, what started off as a thoughts of how to kill myself if I reach my suicidal phase turns into a “I want to die.” But I realize that I can’t kill myself, because I can’t do it, it’s not in me, it’s in my head but it doesn’t tell me to do it. I never attempted it and can’t even cut my arm. So I stop having it because it’s not gonna happen.

For a while, I think the reasoning behind this is because I’m a coward, I couldn’t end the pain of living so I have to live like you’re half alive and half dead at the same time. Recently, I talk about this to a lad I know, and he said that wasn’t cowardice, that was bravery. 

Because despite all the shit that happens to me and around me and in the world, I still choose to live. Despite growing up in a dysfunctional family, despite not studying that much in school and potentially not getting into college, despite the world being a shitty place where the rich gets richer where the rest burns in hell. Despite all of that odds, I’m still here. Not living fully, but still breathing, that’s a plus for me I guess, I am crawling but I am moving slowly. I went to sleep that night and give myself a smile in the dark because why not? It’s a command given by a brain, but a smile. Maybe I’ll read a book, idk."
fg3x6f,Anxiety,"Does anyone have a ""hangover"" period following a high-anxiety/stressful event?","Such as attending a concert, speaking in front of an audience, or anything that makes you nervous?

I used to be fine going to shows, concerts, anything. I liked it.  
But ever since my first ever panic attack I've been physically ""shaky"", even sometimes when I am not even mentally worried at the time.  
It's like my body turned into a chicken.

Now when I attend an event, I sometimes feel stress symptoms.  
Then after the high excitement/stress event, I sometimes get a ""hangover"" period. I feel so exhausted and sometimes hungry.  


This is when the heart palpitations sometimes kick in. I feel my wrist and it's sometimes about every 5th beat, and sometimes about every 20th beat. These heart palpitations give my chest a weird, uneasy feeling. There's this vague but strong discomfort in chest area, to the point where the thought of going to the ER crosses the mind.

Then I go to bed, get lots of sleep, and wake up still tired when slight anxiety-like tremors the next day. But then as that day progresses, it starts to feel a little better.

Does anyone's body feel ""shaken"" after high excitement/stress events where it takes a while to recover?"
jgqtcf,Anxiety,I was tearing up on a zoom call saying that I was having a rough past few days and my prof said...,"“well, just go get it done now. I want it done by the end of the afternoon. this is like FUN work for you! oh and, go take some deep breaths.” 

.... this is why I don’t even speak about my mental health. I can be on the verge of tears on a call with a professor, and their reply is to go do the work anyways. 

It’s disgusting and I wish professors would treat bad mental health like they would bad physical health. I am not doing well and it disappoints me every time when I remember that the world as a whole simply doesn’t care."
hj1r6d,Anxiety,Does anybody else have morning anxiety? It's just there the moment you wake up.,"All the worries and problems of your life start popping in your head and makes your morning miserable.
The evenings before are relatively calm but the anxiety hits hard in the morning while you're still in bed.

Edit: Thank you all for the responses. Makes me feel that I'm not alone in this.
I really hope this passes for all of us."

212q2t,Anxiety,Can I just say...,
ii3u7i,Anxiety,Really missing the pre-COVID world when my severe anxiety was just cuz of regular trauma lmao,"Hi beautiful people ❤️ Just wanted to vent here over the same feelings everyone else probably has. 

I’ve been watching a lot of shows (haven’t we all tbh) lately and seeing people living normally onscreen makes me so sad. I’ve become so used to how we’re living now that it sometimes trips me out to see people without masks on TV. I hate that going to the grocery store gives me intense anxiety now and that Wal-Mart feels like a goddamn battle zone for me lmao. I hate how paranoid and helpless I’ve been feeling. I hate that I’m afraid to leave my house and fear every time my loved ones do too. I hate that my boyfriend and I feel like we’re in a long distance relationship when he’s only 40 minutes away haha. I hate that I can’t hold my baby cousin and see his chubby lil face. I hate that I can barely see my loved ones outside of the house and I worry about them every day. I hate that I have to plan how I can do basic things like going to the post office or going to work just to minimize exposure. I hate that the government where I live is basically useless in keeping us safe and they just keep prioritizing money over our health. I hate that almost no one in Hawai’i (where I live) is taking it seriously anymore, tourists are still coming in, and our numbers are literally tripling by the day. 

My OCD and anxiety has kicked into an intense high gear ever since this happened and it’s so emotionally draining. And it doesn’t help that every extreme precaution I take for my parents sake, they don’t follow. Whenever I get home from work or the store, it’s like a 30 minute process of sanitizing all my belongings that I brought, showering, washing my clothes, and cleaning my hands a million times. But my family doesn’t do the same so I’m worried that it’s all for nothing. We’ve luckily been ok for the most part and I feel privileged to be able to say that. I feel a little silly complaining, but as a house full of essential workers (aside from my dad who got fired from his job at the beginning of COVID after 19 years) I’m just constantly on edge. I just wanna protect all my loved ones and I feel like I can’t. And I know I can’t. I just wish I could. 

I just needed to vent because like everyone else, I just feel so drained. But I still feel lucky to have what and who I have at the same time. I just wish this was over already. It feels like it won’t ever be."
hcgov8,Anxiety,"It’s insane to me how different things are when you are severely depressed/anxious , vs. when you are not. It disguises itself as something important.","When you’re not so low mentally and for once you feel great, the things you worry yourself to death over all day every day when you are struggling, are the same things you are proud of when you are not struggling. When you feel whole again and not like every decision is life and death. 

The things some people don’t understand about the people who commit suicide/think about suicide, is that we do not want to die. We just want to escape the pain that we can’t seem to putting ourselves through. I promise there is hope. Please keep going, I’m speaking from experience of doing some things I don’t even want to type to myself, you will see that light again that you once saw in life. You will smell things, look at things, listen to things, become genuinely intrigued with what people say, or everyday hobbies. 

I promise this bullshit is not permanent. Just keep finding yourself and growing. You are still growing emotionally, spiritually, etc, even when you don’t think you are. And one day you will all of a sudden realize, “holy shit, I’ve came so far mentally from that pit I used to be in. “

Trust yourself. Only you really knows you."
kuj1l7,Anxiety,A shoutout to people who doesn’t have any emotional support from family or friends,"I don’t know what I want to say with this post really, and I hope someone doesn’t get offended by it.

Rather than advising OPs to overcome their external circumstances, people on here give them the support to manage their internal struggles because change isn’t possible without addressing that.

Repeat this for a minute or as long as you need, and you will feel better. Try to smile if you can because it does help a bit. If it's still tight, it helps to hold the tension (safely) on purpose, and then let the tension go as you exhale. For your chest try breathing in fully (belly-chest-head), holding it, and ""squeezing"" the air to your head. After a bit (10 seconds or so) let it go and feel the tension dissipate. You guys deserve this for toughing it out in this crazy time of our lives. You will get through, and here's a ritual to help you out. Whenever you want to dial it back a bit, go through these motions. Here's a virtual hug you guys."

I see posts about people having no friends and how making friends is hard all the time and I get it, I'm in that boat too. So I want to reach out to the people who would like a complete stranger to check up on them at a completely random time over the next 31 days.

If you leave your username I'll go through, when I'm bored, and send you a private message asking ""are you ok?""

You can reply with one word, yes or no, or you can spill your guts to me and I'll do my best to give you good advice or at the very least give you a ""Fuck that * insert person* for being such a * insert derogatory name.*""

Ok that is all :) 

Edit: Wow it went from 6 to 56 in an hour, I thought 30 would be a good number but this is also good. Thanks for all your kind words and to be honest I'm getting anxiety from just thinking about sending so many messages to random people but I promise I will get around to everyone by the end of the month. 

Edit 2: As suggested by a couple of people you can absolutely take note of a few users and send them a PM if you'd like. Me included. 

Edit 3: Oh crap, so long inbox, I barely got to know you. I'll just let this die down a bit before I start sending out more RU OK? PM's. But they will come, and when you least expect it, so don't wait on it. I'll be an RU OK? ninja. Striking when you least expect it. "

Edit: first silver ever!  Thanks kind stranger. 

I suffer from anxiety all the time. As I’ve gotten older I try to focus on the anxiety as energy moving throughout my body.  If I have anxiety and I feel it in my stomach, I zone in on how my stomach is feeling, pay attention to the anxiety moving throughout my body and it helps to relieve it eventually, don’t ignore it as it’s there for your attention, something about your mental thinking or the physical world is causing this energy to enter your body, find out what it is, pay attention, don’t ignore it."
gg45u4,Anxiety,Anyone always have a show playing in the background to help anxiety?,"For me it started a few years ago when I lived by myself and I couldn't take the complete silence. It just gives me too much free brain space to focus on my other senses. With sounds in the background, it's a bit easier to drown out stuff like heart palpitations or thoughts about how scared I am. I mean, it doesn't stop anxiety and I still get anxiety attacks but it does soothe me to an extent. So if I'm by myself, I have something playing almost all the time, usually from when I wake up to when I go to sleep, but especially at night. I wonder if there's any harm in playing sounds all day long. I don't play it loud but maybe the constant stimulation has a negative effect on the brain. Either way, I can't stop now, I just get way too anxious without anything in the background and I prefer a show with people talking to a white noise machine.

So, anyone do that too? What shows do you watch? I usually just rewatch shows old favorites, and I leave new shows for when I actually want to pay attention. I've been playing Friends and Brooklyn 99 a lot recently.

Edit: This got so many replies! I appreciate everyone who took the time to comment. Pretty awesome that all of us here have the same experience, makes me feel less like a weirdo because my ex used to always be amazed how I can just rewatch the same show over and over for weeks. She accepted shows playing 24/7 but she didn't get it like y'all do :)"

kzo87a,Anxiety,Reminder: Anxiety is suffering a simulation,"The suffering is real but you're suffering a simulation. It's not real. 

It's imaginary. 

It's all lies.

A part of your own mind made it up so it can't be an actual danger.

Actual dangers come from outside you.

Fear is meant to protect you from danger. 

But when fear overworks and causes life to become a living hell, it loses its whole point of existence.

Fear isn't meant to make you suffer endlessly, it is only meant to spur you to act in defense for a short while. If you keep looping in a fear cycle, fear has defeated its own purpose and should stop functioning.

There is a reasonable amount of light fear called Eustress that is justified and keeps you on your toes in a hostile environment. Anything more than that fear, anything that paralyses you, that hinders your full functioning, that prevents you from thinking straight, that prevents you from working according to a plan, is excess fear, and by definition has defeated its own purpose. Such fear has no point existing.

The higher number of times you affirm ""I'm actually safe except for XYZ"" the the faster you will feel better.

Remember, unless you're actually in an active war zone or shooting, you;re quite safe. Say it to yourself - ""I'm actually quite safe except for XYZ"".

Finally, remember: Hot flashes, crawling ants, crampy, pain, tingling, needles and other sensations, are _discomfort_, not danger. 

Discomfort is uncomfortable, but safe.

Edit: Jesus Christ this blew up. Thank you so much for all the awards. Replying will take time. Y'all know how it goes - up and down, excited, scared, happy, sad, the full range in an hour!"
an6nrz,Anxiety,"After months of unemployment due to anxiety and depression, I’ve now landed myself a job","I’ve had anxiety and depression for quite a while, years; it usually creeps up on me but then goes away, it depends on my mindset and lifestyle.

Now, I can proudly say I turned up for an interview shaken and paranoid to be working there today and it feels great to be distracted. I can be on my own, I don’t have to talk to people all day and it’s laid back; perfect for myself.

I am extremely proud of myself, although I still have a lot of issues with my mental health I need to address, small steps like this really help everything else.

a9z1y0,Anxiety,Hello this is an experiment.,"I am afraid to post on social media. This is a test for myself to see exactly what kind of interactions I can have from doing this. I tried this before and deleted it after 20 minutes, so I just want to see how long I can keep this post up before deleting. Have a great day 

Edit: Thanks so much for all of the support! All the comments and messages were very helpful :)"

e5oslf,Anxiety,I just had a small conversation with two girls in my class AND I DIDNT OVERTHINK IT they were so nice and we laughed a little. And I even went to the board today to participate in my maths class and I volunteered for it!!! And I dont feel nervous I just feel excited and happy and accomplished yay.,It's so weird feeling this way because I was thinking of committing suicide two days ago
l48hq6,Anxiety,Getting ready too early and having to wait around before you leave the house is the WORST,"I’m ready for work. I’ve worked at this place for 2 years. I don’t hate my job. Yet here I am, anxious as fuck because I’m ready 30 mins too early to leave the house. Wtf?"
de4c2i,Anxiety,It's okay that that cringy moment happened to you in highschool,"It doesn't matter, we've all been there."
jjd5pu,Anxiety,Has anyone been having an ESPECIALLY bad October?,"I was doing pretty okay in COVID times living in New York since March but for the past month, things have gotten so much worse. I don't know if its fatigue, the election, etc etc but it feels so much worse right now. 

&#x200B;

Scheduled my very first therapy session this week because I'm just feeling it so much more than I have before. Hope you all are doing okay!"
ie3uac,Anxiety,"Feels like I am constantly bracing for the next ""bad thing"" to happen to me.","Title pretty much sums it up. I feel like I can never relax, never live fully or happily, because I am simply constantly mentally preparing myself for whatever next bad thing will happen to me. For example, I finally met this pretty great person, we had a great time, and yet somehow, even when I was most happy with them, I was mentally preparing myself for the inevitable fact that it would fall apart (and it did, but, granted, that was because of lockdowns and stuff).

Health worries are also pretty prominent. Whenever I'm pretty healthy, I can never enjoy it, because I frankly am just getting ready and thinking about what next health woe will be thrown my way and how I will be miserable because of it. Even now, I have a problem where I literally can not stop thinking about worst case scenarios, regardless of likelihood. I have done everything I can -- called my specialist, set up an appointment, and will receive the next step in treatment, and I have refilled my current medication to treat it. And yet, here I am, worrying obsessively about infection or something -- despite me having this problem for three years and my worst case scenario not coming true. (\*\*knock on wood\*\*).

I can't relax. I can't stop bracing for the next bad/uncomfortable thing to happen, and even when I am doing everything I possibly can, I don't feel good enough to live my life. I am tired and miserable. I know I need a therapist, but office closures make it tough to do so, especially as I want to see one in person.

EDIT: Wow, I really had no idea this post would take off the way it did. It's funny that I used my throwaway account, for discussing some of the issues that I'm most embarrassed about, and am getting some of the best responses and best advice on. Thank you to each and every one of you."
gpagps,Anxiety,Honestly not wanting quarantine to be over,"I haven’t done anything social since covid started and I’m loving it. I hate parties, I hate social events so the fact that I like almost legally can’t go to any is great. Our state just okayed social gatherings of <10 people though so immediately my boyfriend’s friends decided to have a fire and invited us. 

I’m having an absolutely awful anxiety day - I’m guessing the fact that it’s tonight is primarily causing it, and I don’t want to go at all.

Is it normal to want to be by yourself this much? It’s been almost 3 months of quarantine and I’m still not socially rejuvenated."
lg4lbk,Anxiety,"I think the scariest thing about GAD is that it changes *your* reality AND actual reality, and you have no idea to what degree of each.","Anxiety isn't always just ""you thinking one thing but it's not reality"", because it can create very real physical effects on the body, which seem totally unrelated to the anxiety.

You could get a random rash one day when you didn't feel anxious at all. So you're like, ""Do I need to find another cause of this? Or was it the anxiety?"" And you have no idea if you should go to the doctor, and then the dermatologist, and then get your blood checked. You just don't know how far to go with it.

One rash might be 90% anxiety-caused and 10% environmentally-caused, and then another rash that looks exactly the same might be the opposite."
j8cj95,Anxiety,I got the job!!,"After 4 intense interviews, a bunch of horrible phone calls and almost a whole bottle of CBD oil, I got the job offer today!! I got the job over 100 other candidates I’m so happy!!

Thank you everyone for the sweet comments and rewards. I wish you all success in your journeys. 🙂"
hr4h39,Anxiety,Does your anxiety also make you feel like you’re in a temporary situation?,"It’s hard to explain, but I always feel like I’m on high alert because of *something* and that as soon as this something is gone, my anxiety will decrease. Except when I take the time to think about it, there’s no something. Nothing special is happening and nothing will go away. This is my life.
It’s the kind of the stress you’d get before an important interview, except the post-interview relief never comes.
I’m so exhausted."
gyvqyz,Anxiety,I'm defending my master's thesis before a jury in approximately 1 hour.,"Heart pounding. Shortness of breath. Dizziness.

dyfwbm,Anxiety,Hadn’t Left the house in four years update.,"Hello all, I wanted to give an update on my progress in hopes to maybe inspire just one person to take that first step.  4 1/2 years ago I had a complete mental breakdown due to a number of stressors and my alcohol abuse reaching critical mass.  Prior to this I did suffer from anxiety for years but was still able to hold down a job, have a social life and be a relatively good father to my children.  
    After being house bound for 3 1/2  years I wasn’t able to walk to the mailbox without having a panic attack. I was so depressed and defeated I didn’t see the point in even existing anymore. I felt I had nothing to offer this world so in what literally felt like a life and death decision I reached out for help. I called my local  NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness) chapter and tearfully admitted the hell I had been going through.  It felt so liberating just to hear my voice letting some of that pain out. After a half hour or so on the phone, the women kindly suggested I start talking to a therapist via video chat. I did some research and decided on a company called betterhelp. I was assigned a counselor and she helped me to come around to the idea of medication. I then began video chat sessions with a psychiatrist with a company Teladoc. I was prescribed 15 mg (after a gradual increase) of lexapro.  My wife of coarse had to pick up the called in script from the pharmacy. The first two months were not good to say the least, I had a lot of side effects but I pushed through and by the third month i started feeling a little bit of my confidence returning.  I would take little walks a couple hundred feet from the house.  I started to white knuckle drive around the block.  In May of this year at 5 months of medication, on a Saturday morning something in me clicked.  I just said fuck it, jumped in my car and drove a couple miles down the road through multiple stoplights to a Home Depot, went inside and made a purchase. It was TERRIFYING!  I was a nervous wreck but by the time I made it home I was so stinkin proud of myself I was gitty. I came right on here to reddit and announced my crowning achievement. 
     In the time since then I push myself everyday. Little by little expanding my comfort zone.  I now can drive anywhere in the city, I have even taken the freeway to the next city over. I go for walks with my family to the park. I have gone out to dinners and reconnected with some old friends. Most importantly the quality time out of the house with my children has returned me a mindset that I do have value, and I do have something to offer this world.  I still have down days but overall I am happy and proud of the progress I have made.   
    For me the combination of medication and cognitive behavioral therapy has proven to loosen the chains of anxiety but none of this would have been possible without taking that very first step of many first steps,    Asking for help!   From the bottom of my heart I wish all of you the best."
8nlgx3,Anxiety,Does anyone go over all the stupid and awkward shit you’ve done in your head over and over again?,It’s one of those days I guess. I’m beating myself over stuff that happened years ago for some reason today.

But to those that are here and in a state, look, I’m on the other side today. You’ve been okay before, you’ll be okay again. You’re doing just fine. Breathe. :)",
bym87e,Anxiety,Have you guys been crippled by your anxiety so much that you just don't do your assignments?,"Hi,

This is me. Worrying about my assignments just makes me stay still and not do anything.

Not doing anything leads to even more anxiety and more anxiety cripples me from doing anything. Its like a shitty negative feedback loop. 


As a result Im actually failing this unit lol. Every assignment has been handed late due to cripplying anxiety. 

I even got a fucking extension and I am way past THAT due date as well. 

God everything fucking sucks."
8z20x2,Anxiety,Who else has anxiety about not doing enough with their life?,"To give a brief backstory, I graduated college in Spring 2017 and was still working as a barista at Starbucks. About two months after graduation I started to really feel the effects of my anxiety. I was panicking that I didn’t already have a better job and that I was gonna lose my apartment because I couldn’t pay bills. After relentlessly searching until February 2018, I found a job as a sales rep at a cell phone store. Since February, I’ve been doing great! I’ll be making about $40k a year and after five years of struggling with bills, I can comfortably afford my apartment!

Now, since about April, I’ve been having anxiety, again, about me feeling like I’m not doing enough. I’ve been relaxing a lot, going out to places with friends (because now I can afford it,) and playing a lot of video games(it’s always been a hobby.)  But I’m feeling pressure to go back and get a masters in the hopes of finding a better job and really going for something that I actually dreamed of doing. I just can’t find the will to break away from this relaxed mood the change in pay has given me. Every time I try to give up playing video games and going out with people, in hopes of working towards something, I go right back into this comfortable routine. 

Does anyone else feel this way/get anxiety about this? If so...does it go on forever? Will there ever be a time that I feel fully, 100% relaxed and comfortable with how I’m surviving and doing things that make me happy?"

fsa1lu,Anxiety,"Today I realised that the only person who has ever got me, is me. I used to need reassurance from people around me that I am going to be okay, but the only person I ever needed to hear it from was myself.","When I’m anxious and slowly feel myself starting to spiral down into my anxious thoughts, I was always reaching out to other people, just needing to hear someone tell me I’m going to be okay. Now I have realised the only person I need to hear those words from are myself. I am slowly learning that a lot of the time it really is mind over matter; and oh boy, is my mind strong. I don’t need to depend on other people to reassure me I am okay. I can’t. I need to break the cycle. 
I feel I have come so far. I can sit there and tell myself I am going to be okay, and I can sort of believe it. It is so fucking hard to do, and it is so exhausting. I know each time I can do this I am making myself stronger. 

I don’t know why I am posting this. I guess I just had a sudden outburst of feeling somewhat empowered."

d02jdo,Anxiety,Anyone else have to basically be dead to call off of work and not feel guilty?,"My stomach is an absolute mess, i can barely move without running to the toilet. But telling my boss I can't come in makes me crazy anxious, worrying they'll think I'm slacking or something. So then I put it off until I have to leave and just end up showing up and being miserable and unproductive all day. Anyone have issues calling off?"
g2yamz,Anxiety,so much of my childhood was undiagnosed anxiety,"my behaviors as a kid were so obviously undiagnosed anxiety and OCD. how did no one see or care. now, it’s on me to try to fix myself in a toxic environment with no access to help of any kind due to social distancing. poor child me had no idea what was happening or why she felt like that. poor thing. i feel so bad for her and her issues and why she didn’t realize they weren’t normal.

aes481,Anxiety,"I just found out about this subreddit and spent the last hour scrolling throught it. Never felt so good in a long time, you guys bring me hope and it is freaking awesome, so many positive vibes and helpfull tips. This is one of the best remedy i ever had.....",

cdmy2t,Anxiety,Does anyone else obsess over every little thing they say to people?,"Pretty much every social interaction I have with someone, no matter how small, I spend a ridiculous amount of time afterwards playing back what I said over and over again in my head. Even if what I said was totally normal, I still harp on it and pick it apart until I've convinced myself I've made a fool of myself."
ipyxxd,Anxiety,I just asked to pet someone's dog!,"I know it seems small and insignificant, but I'm really nervous and anxious to speak to people about anything, so I'm super proud of myself.

It was a small conversation, nothing big, but I'm still proud."
fv6vhu,Anxiety,Corona killed my anxiety,"Basically,  having to work from home and not go out to socialise has given my mind and body a much needed break.  

Working from home means that I don't have a lot of the job related anxiety that makes me dread Sundays and Mondays. I am also able to save on the 2 hours of commute and so I have a lot more free time.  

Not having to wake up early means I get 8 plus hours of sleep every night. I didn't realise how much lack of sleep was affecting my mood.  

Not having to go out means I no longer need to worry about my IBS related stomach problems. I also no longer feel pressured to socialise (im an introvert by nature and love staying at home and playing games / watching tv). 

With all the time I have, I finally feel like I am no longer running behind the ball, and have the time to reset, rest and do the things I love, without judgement. 

It just feels like the wonderful break ive always dreamt of but never thought possible.  

Appreciate that this is a hard time for most and dont deny what people are going through.  I got lucky because I have a very stable job and its just my husband and I at home."
7ern0j,Anxiety,"I decided to fight for net neutrality, even with social anxiety. It has been the easiest thing ever.","I am sure all of you have seen the posts across Reddit about the fight to keep net neutrality, and the FCC upcoming vote to dismantle it. Personally, I feel that we need to keep net neutrality, but you are, of course, entitled to your own opinion. I don't want to get into the politics of it all, but I'm sure you can find that elsewhere on Reddit.

So this is just my story about how it has been going for me to voice my opinion on the matter, even when I get social anxiety. Just picking up the phone and having to talk to another human can be difficult sometimes — whether it be calling the store to find what time it closes or having to get support with technology — it makes me nervous just thinking about it. So you can imagine what it must feel like to want to voice my opinion — something I rarely do as it is because I worry about alienating people or making them upset. Especially when it comes to politics.

The main things that concerned me about calling my local representatives were... What do I say? My representative doesn't share the same political beliefs I do, so are they going to argue with me over the phone? Is there something special I need to do when they pick up? Maybe I should just hang up...

**First off**, I used [this website](http://www.battleforthenet.com), which is an automated system that auto-dials your representatives for you, based on your ZIP code. Plus, it even gives you a basic script you can say. Literally, I said this word for word: ""Hello. I just wanted to call to express my opinion about net neutrality. So... um... yeah, I support 'Title Two' net neutrality rules and I would like you guys to publicly oppose the FCC's plan to repeal them. I would really like if you guys would contact the FCC Chairman and demand that he abandon his current plan. I don't believe we need legislation, so instead we really need you to stop the FCC from getting rid of the existing rules. So um... that's all. Thanks.""

**Secondly**, the dude on the other end of the line is just some staffer — often some college kid that takes phone calls for the representative's office. They were practically a robot themselves, and to be honest, they don't care to have a discussion about my political beliefs, even if they don't share them. There wasn't any argument, nor did they say much of anything at all.

**And finally**, I didn't hang up! I stuck with it, and just read the script. When the lackey on the phone was done hearing me out, you can press star (*) on your phone, and boom — it hangs up on them, the automated system gave me a pat on the back (seriously, she says, ""You're doing great!""), and it automatically calls the next representative.

-----

At the end of the day, I felt relieved that I did it. I was so anxious about it at first! But when I spoke with these people, they didn't say much of anything, and I didn't feel scared because I realized their whole job is listening to people complain. The guy on the other end of the phone is just some dude who literally listens to calls all day and just forwards your comments to the man or woman in charge. The most that was said to me was when they asked for my address and ZIP code to confirm I lived in their district. That was it.

Long story short: even with my anxiety issues, I found it to be easier than I expected, and it made me feel like I accomplished something.

P.S. My first attempt was in the evening, after my representatives' offices had closed. I did this because I didn't want to talk to someone on the first try. So I just left them messages on their voicemail expressing my opinion, but I found that sometimes their voicemail was full. So I need to try again the next day, because otherwise, I'm not being heard.

**tl;dr:** I expected to feel huge social anxiety calling my representatives to support net neutrality. Turned out to be the easiest thing ever, and made me feel like I made a huge accomplishment regarding my condition. It also means I actually did something that allowed me to voice my opinion, which made me feel good."
bg54j6,Anxiety,Anybody else enjoy the rain to calm them down?,"I’m sure a lot of you do, but I’m just having a shitty Monday and feeling extra depressed today for some reason. I saw it’s going to rain for the rest of the day once I get home from work, I got really excited and I can’t wait to sit at home to watch and listen to the rain to calm me down, it helps so much.

I hope you guys are having a great Monday."
liavx4,Anxiety,Anyone gets anxiety because of their anxiety?,I feel like I get anxiety or panic attack because I'm scared of those feelings. It's like I don't want to feel them and that's what triggers more anxiety. I don't know if this is a common feeling for those with anxiety disorder but I think it's exactly how I feel.
8rghqs,Anxiety,Does anyone else still stress out and feel embarrassed over things that happened 10-20 years ago?,"I'm almost 30 years old and I still lay awake at night, feeling like a complete idiot of myself when I was 10-16 years old.

How do you get past this stuff?"
iz5wu5,Anxiety,"I don't know where else to share this, but I want to share it with folks who understand how big this is - I'm filled with nervous excitement, BUT I'm going to be talking on my local radio station this Sunday about the anxiety podcast I started during the pandemic which has taken off!","After an initial wave of catastrophizing, now I'm pumped up, haha!

A producer actually reached out to the little Facebook page my cohost and I run, and I didn't even think it was real at first. Woohoo!

I'm sitting at my computer, and I legitimately feel so cared about. It's incredible. Thank you! Those two words don't seem like enough, but thank you!

My boss has been away for over a month and I was basically left to my own devices, which was great. He returned today.

Yesterday and last night, I was so worried that I would get depressed that it turned into anxiety. Then I began worrying that I hadn't done enough while he was away that it created even more anxiety. 

I woke up drenched in a cold sweat this morning and called in sick. Now I'm anxious that they'll be pissed off that I wasn't at work yesterday. 

It's a vicious circle and I'm ashamed of myself for running away from my problems.

kfe739,Anxiety,"I am 25 and finally got my licence!!!! I have major test anxiety and failed my first test because I had a panic attack, breath and believe in yourself, we can do this!",
ch08i6,Anxiety,DAE get nervous to return to work or school after you've been away for a little while?,"For me, it doesn't seem to matter how comfortable I am somewhere (though it is worse at newer/less familiar places), but if I get sick or something and skip a few days of class or work, I get really anxious to go back. Particularly when I've been sick because I'm afraid I won't be totally better and I'll have to come home or it'll cause a lot of problems. Right now, I'm returning to work after leaving sick last week and I'm really anxious about it."
io64in,Anxiety,Have you ever felt so depressed that you feel actually sick?,"This weekend has been horrible for me, i had maybe 3-4 panic attacks just on the weekend, would maybe be more if I didn't take a computer session, but here is the thing I don't have fever, but now is Monday and i haven't had a panic attack yet but I feel like I need to puke and I'm so hot that I'm sweating, I didn't go to work because I felt like shit."
kmegs9,Anxiety,Anyone else find themselves trying to anticipate EVERYTHING instead of just living?,"Title says it mostly. I’m just curious if anyone else has the same tendency? I just can’t stop trying to anticipate everyone’s reaction to something or everything’s.


Edit: well shit this got a lot more attention than I.... anticipated. Going to read comments now an hopefully reply to some."
d93rqg,Anxiety,"I would trade anything in the world, ANYTHING, just to not have anxiety anymore. I just wish this struggle would end.",
cby68t,Anxiety,"Anyone else feel so self-aware of their anxiety, it almost feels like you’re faking it?","Even in the middle of a mild panic attack, I can feel myself freaking out — I know my breathing is shallow, my heart is beating really fast, and my thoughts are scrambled and erratic. But because I’m aware of all of this, it almost makes me feel bad, like I’m putting on some kind of performance, or am just reacting this way for attention (even when I’m by myself!)

Maybe it doesn’t make a lot of sense when I type it out, but does anyone else feel this way?"
7vrzcw,Anxiety,Does anyone else here always feel like they’re in some sort of trouble or someone is upset with them?,"I think one of the worse symptoms of my anxiety is that I often feel in “trouble” or like someone is upset with me. 

Usually this will happen after working a shift or leaving classes for the day. 

I end up questioning the things I did or said during the day and if I did everything correctly. Often times these anxieties come up when trying to go to sleep. 

Does anyone else get this? How do you combat the feelings?"
i8qyhz,Anxiety,I ASKED FOR A DAY OFF!!!!,"I'm so excited rn omggggg. The schedule for next week came out today and I was super excited because I had two days off in a row and my mental health hasn't been the greatest lately so I was super excited. But then my mom spoke for me (she works at the same place I do) and said I wanted another day for more hours so I was scheduled another day and only had one day off. I was so upset so I went to talk to the person that makes the schedules and I was honest with her. I said that my mental health hasn't been great and that I would like to have the two days in a row. She was so nice about it and just gave the shift to someone else and I'm so proud of myself!

Tldr: overcame anxiety and was honest with my boss about my mental health"

jtj1t2,Anxiety,I’m not doing well.,"I just need to get things off my chest.

The truth is, I’m not doing well. I’m so overwhelmed these days, and I can’t relax. Something is always on my mind, something is always bothering me. I’m constantly irritated, and it’s frustrating. My emotions feel invalid — I have a home, I have food on my table, what do I have to be upset or stressed over? I feel so disconnected from myself and from others. I’m afraid to reach out to others — I’ve definitely pushed a lot of people away this year. I don’t know how or if I can bounce back to whatever my *normal* was.

Edit: WOW, I did not expect to get this much feedback, but I thank each and every one of you for the advice and kind words."
l68j1z,Anxiety,I (30f) just celebrated my 1 year anniversary with the only bf who's ever taken my anxiety seriously.,"We both make allowances for each other's mental health and support each other every single day. 

I could've settled for someone who didn't understand or support me, but I had the confidence to leave those relationships and wait for the perfect partner. 

I'm really glad about that. It was tempting just to have someone next to me. Waiting for real love is worth it, even when you feel like you'll never meet your soul mate. We met on tinder of all places! After years of feeling alone in the world, I finally feel part of a team. Don't give up!"

iu4ewo,Anxiety,I got ice cream on my own!,"A few days ago, I really felt like getting some ice cream and I saw an ice cream shop down the road. Walking towards it, I was arguing with myself to do or not to do it. Would it be weird? Getting ice cream on my own? Who does that? I almost walked by, but something inside myself told me 'who cares, even if they think it's weird, you don't know these people and probably will never see them again'. I turned of my thoughts, got in line... And got some ice cream! It was great."
hwsflp,Anxiety,Does anyone else feel overly stressed/anxious when the area/room they are in is cluttered and messy?,"We are renovating our house right now and there are things everywhere and not where they normally belong, it is making me feel SO stressed and anxious. I literally feel heightened with the need to clean and put things back. The mess is at the forefront of my brain and it's like I am not able to function until everything is tidy and neat. I feel overwhelmed by it all."
iv37hb,Anxiety,Spending lunch in the bathroom my first day of work just like my first day of high school,My trainer abandoned me to wander around the facility trying to find the lunch room on my own and all my coworkers didn’t bother to acknowledge me or say hi. Got so anxious I went to the bathroom and started dry heaving and decided I might as well just stay in here. Cried a lot. Trying to hold the tears back going back to work now. Stressed I’m going to cry in front of my trainer after being totally normal the first half of shift. I’m honestly so exhausted from just trying to exist as a human being.
er2fjs,Anxiety,I (F17) told my dad about my anxiety and got unexpected reaction,"Posted it on r/relationship but got removed. The mods told me to post here instead.




English is not my first language so please neglect any mistakes. I've always suffered from mild depression and social anxiety. I'm sure my parents know of it because of my mental breakdowns and also because my dad is a doctor himself. I love my parents but they are just too busy with their life and profession. They're hardly even home. They've remained uninvolved in most of life.


So this happened a few weeks back. I was really troubled because of school, couldn't sleep and was having a meltdown. I don't know what came over me but I went ahead and woke my dad. I asked him to come to the living room while sobbing. As soon as we sat on the couch, I poured my heart out to him. He didn't say anything. Except a few ""hmm""s and nods. Lastly he calmly asked me if I would like to meet a friend of his ( he didn't directly say a therapist ). He then went ahead to tell me that my illness is valid and seeking help won't deem me as ""crazy"". I refused and went to sleep.

The next morning as usual my parents were not home but my lil brother (M13) was there. He asked me if I had talked to Dad about something. I acted confused. He then started crying and telling me that I should have told him if I was suffering so much. I calmed him down (which took quite a while) and afterwards he told me that mom and dad were talking about me. Dad told mum to make sure that the environment of our home was a happy place for me and they were planning to make time for me/family by taking some time off. 

I've never ever felt such love from any thing or person. I'm so so blessed. I'm just so thankful for my family. I feel like I can endure anything. I just wish I would have leaned on my family for support earlier. Please everyone if you're suffering, reach out to your loved ones. It can make a world of difference, I promise!



tl;dr - reached out to my dad and got unexpected support and love from family ❤️

c0li0r,Anxiety,anyone gets stomach upset when anxious ?,"I always get a very bad stomachache (diarrhea, constant farting and all kinds of smelly stuff) especially when i get anxious - and it’s always my left side of my stomach. Ugh..it’s truly awful..anyone had the same experience or is currently going through it?

*updated post*
Hello again everyone - thank you so much for sharing your experience! definitely did not expect to receive a lot of comments. My only big difference with you is that I’ve never been nauseous but just pumping out a lot of gases haha. Anyway, thanks again for your comments. I’m glad I am not alone in this:)"
bh877x,Anxiety,I got my drivers license.. at 29,"I finally did it.. It took me until early this year to start working on my license (first aid, theory, driving hours)  
My 1st attempt I ended up having my exam hour on the one day when it was raining so hard I could barely see out of the car (I'd never driven in rain before)... I completely panicked and froze and, of course, didn't pass

  
I had my 2nd attempt yesterday, and even though I was shaking/sweating and (as the instructor later pointed out) made a couple of mistakes - I passed  
About 11 years late compared to everyone else my age, but I finally have my license"
aklqpy,Anxiety,The list I keep on my phone to help me calm down during high stress and anxiety,"Not sure it will help anyone else but here is a list of stuff I keep on my phone to help me calm down during moments of high stress and anxiety.  I have been slowly adding to this list over the past 4 years when I first started experiencing daily panic attacks and now I find myself rarely referring to it. Hope it helps someone else!

&#x200B;

**Note to Self**

* Give it 20 minutes.
* When you have a negative thought, replace it with a positive one or make up a positive one and fake it til you make it.
* The more I say “fuck it”, the better I feel.
* It’s just your thoughts.
* I don't know what's going to happen in the future but I know everything is going to be okay.
* You got this. You know you're competent enough so that you won't fail in life.
* What’s the worst that can happen if you fail? Nothing.
* Look at the grand scheme of things. Don’t focus so much in the moment. There will be a tomorrow.
* You don’t have to do anything.
* It’s not what I have to do. It’s what I want to do.
* If you feel doomed, that’s because that’s what anxiety tends to do. It escalates a situation that, in reality, isn’t going anywhere.
* Don’t be afraid of your anxiety.
* You are the play, and the world is your audience.
* You shouldn’t be scared. Treat the event or activity as a challenge or opportunity.
* Why do you feel like you have to do anything? You don’t have to do anything.
* The best thing to do is not think about it.
* Staying in the situation will teach your body that everything is ok and there’s nothing to worry about.

(I know some things on this list repeat but I left them there for reinforcement)

&#x200B;

**4-7-8 Breathing Technique**

* First, let your lips part. Make a whooshing sound, exhaling completely through your mouth.
* Next, close your lips, inhaling silently through your nose as you count to four in your head.
* Then, for seven seconds, hold your breath.
* Make another whooshing exhale from your mouth for eight seconds.
* Repeat.

&#x200B;

**AWARE Calming Technique**

* Accept the anxiety. Don’t try to fight it, because it will not take away the anxiety.
* Watch the anxiety. Tell yourself which changes in your body and perception you notice and try to look at yourself as if you are an observer of yourself.
* Act normal. Breath normal and remain calm. Don’t try to escape because that will make you experience your symptoms even more intense. Instead, stay in the situation and experience the anxiety fading away.
* Repeat the steps 1, 2 and 3. If the anxiety is not reduced to an acceptable level yet, then repeat the steps. You’ll see that you’ll calm down soon.
* Expect the best. Practice makes perfect, so practice a lot. Don’t focus on what may happen to you, because that chance is really small.

&#x200B;

**Other**

* As cliched as it sounds, I really recommend trying to live one day at a time. You're overwhelming yourself by trying to do too much/fix too much/make too many decisions at once. Try to breath, enjoy each day as it comes, and give yourself small goals to get back on track.

&#x200B;

Edit: Wow! This post really blew up from when I posted it during an anxiety attack. I'm glad that so many people find it useful and hope you guys gain as much mileage from this list as I have. :D"
irqlx1,Anxiety,i hate anxiety,i just. can’t even explain how it feels in my mind. but i hate it so much.
dx3wji,Anxiety,Do you ever stay up late even when you’re exhausted to avoid facing the next day? Venting,"It’s been a stressful week. 
I just found out I owe more than I thought to the IRS which means I can’t afford to leave my toxic living situation, I can’t afford to see my sick father for the holidays because my new job won’t allow me to have vacation time as a seasonal employee. I have 3 different major assignments coming up that are nowhere near finished. Sometimes I wish I could hit the pause button on life to catch my breath and sort my thoughts. Staying up late is as close as it gets. The rest of the world is asleep and I can think in peace. As soon as I go to sleep, I’ll wake up and it will be time to move through the motions again and scramble to pull myself together. Yes, this is a rant but the question is not rhetorical. Feel free to respond if you relate. This is my first post here (hi)

Edit: I didn’t expect this much support! Thank you! Update: I got one of my assignments done and finished the paperwork for my new job today and I’m feeling good about it! I’ve been brainstorming ways to make my current living situation more bearable, and am aiming to visit my dad over spring break in March. I’m doing my best to stay positive and not dwell on too many negative “what ifs” in regards to his condition. Just trying to focus on one or 2 things at a time to avoid getting overwhelmed or spiraling out. I really do appreciate all of your kind words!"
ai4sba,Anxiety,We don't deserve this.,"None of us do, what we deal with daily is a living hell, and we just don't deserve it at all. It's hard living like this, unbearably hard but let's not forget that we're so strong and resilient for fighting it daily. Some people might wave us off and disregard how we feel with comments like ""just relax, it's not even that bad, you're just overreacting."" but that's bullshit. I know how it is, we all do, and I want you all to know I'm proud of you, you woke up today and you faced anxiety head on, you did a thing, be it small or big you tackled today's tasks and you didn't crumble under anxiety. You're improving, you're doing better bit by bit, and I know how hard that is. So if no one else will tell you, I will, I'm proud of you and you're doing damn good. It might take a long time but I know each and every one of us can overcome this, it might take longer for some of us, but we'll do it. So just keep tackling it day by day, we're stronger than this, we never asked for this, we never once did anything to deserve this, but I know we'll beat it. Stay strong, I love all of you."
f6yw5d,Anxiety,"Do you ever have a week or two without symptoms and then start to think maybe you're finally getting better, but then you're hit with a day which is worse than you'd remembered?","Literally haven't had a problem with ibs symptoms for way over a week now, I finally thought maybe my body is healing and getting back to normal, and then I get hit with the worst stomach cramps on and off all day, my stomach is just in pieces at the moment and it's getting me so down. It's like doing hurdles. Every time I jump one successfully, I end up tripping over the next 7."
bknhwo,Anxiety,Has anyone else been anxious since they were a kid?,"Ever since I was young, I've always been super anxious about everything. There's always been a whole host of things that made me anxious to the point where I'd avoid doing so much, even if I wanted to do whatever I was avoiding. I didn't even realise that it was a problem until I got into my teens and realised how much my anxiety stopped me from enjoying my life. 

From what I've read it seems like most people didn't always experience anxiety (correct me if I'm wrong), but as far back as I can remember I've always been that way. 

I'm just wondering if anyone else has always experienced some form of anxiety since they were very young as well.

Edit: Reading through all the replies, it seems that it's a lot more common than I was expecting. Main reason I was curious was because went to see someone about my anxiety problems, he seemed confused when I told him that I'd always remembered being anxious and it wasn't something that started happening when I was older."
lb8gv4,Anxiety,I TOOK A SHOWER!!,I took a shower today for the first time...since I don’t know when. Kicking depression & anxiety’s ass today 🥺😤
is6wza,Anxiety,I fell asleep on the couch with the backdoor slightly open and woke up to two strangers in my living room.,"We have a cat that likes to sit outside and watch out over our garden. For this reason we often leave the backdoor slightly open, one of those glass sliding doors, until we go to bed and call him inside.

A few days ago we both fell asleep on the couch watching a movie. Sometime during the night I woke up and I saw my partner (I assumed) doing something in the TV cabinet that was really strange. I couldn’t think of anything he would be doing there in the middle of the night and the TV cabinet was also moved away from the wall. So I asked what he was doing. It was dark so I couldn’t see him well and I was still half asleep. He moved his finger to his lips as to say be quiet and walked to the hall. Then I heard whispers and I started to realize something wasn’t right and at that moment I noticed my boyfriend was still lying next to me on the couch. 

It’s so fucked up. I can’t describe the level of shock I felt in that instant. I woke up my partner who immediately was up when I said there were strangers inside our home. They ran out of the front door with all the electronics that were in our living room. My phone, macbook, playstation, etc. They were actually trying to steal the cables as well which was why the TV cabinet was moved. My partner ran after them and managed to get some things back they dropped outside. He ran back inside, dropped those things on our kitchen cabinet, put on shoes, and went back outside searching for them. 

The rest of the events are so weird. I was still trying to get pants on which was very hard in that moment as I felt I was going to pass out. When I finally managed to get my pants and shoes on I went outside but couldn’t see my partner anymore. I didn’t have my phone and did not know what to do. As minutes passed I was scared that something might have happened to him as it was two against one and you don’t know what those other people are like. I took the car and drove to my brother who lives really close by. Woke him up and asked him to call S, my partner, who at that moment just arrived back at our home.

It turns out he was able to follow them because they stole one of our electric steps and one of them was driving it. It has a red backlight (that you can turn off but they did not seem to be aware of this), and he was able to see them from a long distance. He followed them to a parking lot while calling the police. When they noticed he was following them they did something weird and went up to the second deck of the parking lot which has no other exit. My partner blocked the one exit but kept at a distance. Police arrived before they made a move and both were arrested.

After the initial shock I felt pretty good about the situation. I was calm. Relieved my partner was okay. Even enjoying the weird outcome with them getting arrested, especially as later turned out we weren’t the first house they had broke in to. 

But now some negative thoughts are creeping in and I’ve started feeling stressed about it. I think back a lot to the moment when I just woke up and saw him sitting so close to me and the confusion I felt and later the realization of what was going on. Of how I was not able to respond in the moment. How my partner went after them and of what could have happened to him. Of what might happen if they come back or want to spite us for getting them arrested. Or our house gets broken into again. It sucks. I know not all these fears are rational but some are and I have trouble relaxing. Some wise words for me friends?

Edit: Typing this out and waking up to your replies and advise has been really nice. Thank you everyone. I’ll try to respond to you all later today."
g02gqq,Anxiety,Does anyone here also suffer from rejection sensitivity?,"If someone looks at me disapprovingly or even talks to me in an unusual tone, I tend to attribute that to them not liking me, and my body goes into fight or flight mode. I'm essentially convinced that everyone hates me and a lot of that is rooted in social anxiety and feelings of incompetency. I've never tried to make friends because I feel that they will not like me. I can't hang out in social groups because I feel that I act awkward, and I'm afraid that if I act awkward that I will be socially rejected. This really affects my life and my relationships with people-- I basically always feel incompetent. I interpret other's behavior through a very biased lens that harms me. My self esteem largely relies on how others feel about me (or rather how I think others feel about me). 

I don't know what to do anymore. This is a big struggle for me. I've attended therapy before, and it's obvious to me that much of this stems from unresolved childhood issues, but idk. I'm just wondering if there's anyone who feels like this because this makes me feel kinda ashamed and dumb."
7wix08,Anxiety,I love you,I hope you have a relaxing night <3
c8qdj9,Anxiety,i went to a bookstore and got a coffee by myself today!,"i have severe anxiety and it is really difficult for me to do things by myself; i like to have someone with me as it helps me feel less pressured. however, i decided to go to barnes and noble (bookstore) alone today, and they have a cafe in there. the first time i ended up leaving the bookstore without getting a coffee because i was too nervous, but i ended up going back twenty minutes later and got one!! it was so easy, and the barista was very friendly which helped so much. i’m so proud of myself, and i’m so happy. i started to feel a little overwhelmed and almost left again but i did it!! i hope you all are able to silence your anxiety like i did today, and if not, there’s always tomorrow 💛"
jh24tk,Anxiety,I went to barber shop today. ALONE. With NO anxiety. 😎,Thanks to meditation.
dj0b5n,Anxiety,"Today was my first good day in months. My anxiety and depression have stayed low, and I have a positive number in my bank. I feel like I've done some hard work just to have one good day, but it's encouraging.",
5njnw5,Anxiety,"My son isn't even two yet, but sat beside me through an anxiety attack.","So I was having an anxiety attack  in my kitchen. My son was watching TV in the next room and I could hear him. So I sat on the floor and started with the breathing. A few minutes later, he comes into the kitchen cocks his head to the side. He comes over kisses me on the forehead. Then he sits besides me on the floor with a toy and smiles at me then plays with his toy until I calm down. 

Must have done something right with this kid."
kcx2le,Anxiety,DAE: Hate when people tell you ”get out of your comfort zone” or “you’re not growing if you’re in your comfort zone”,"I hate it because I’m ALWAYS uncomfortable. That’s just how generalized anxiety it; you’re always anxious because everything makes you anxious.
I understand the concept of this saying/phrase, but for me/people who are never comfortable, it disregards how we feel on a day to day basis: anxious. Uncomfortable. Never able to chill out or calm down because we are driven by anxiety. 
.

That’s all I wanted to say."
fdn0s2,Anxiety,"I don't give a shit about ""leaving my comfort zone"", I just want to feel comfortable right now","I've never in my life *not* felt anxious, so why the hell should I force myself to keep ""facing my fears"" if it does nothing to help me? Fuck it, I just want to feel okay right now. I don't want to expand my horizons or whatever, I just want to stick to things that make me feel okay-anxiety wise, and if that means staying at home most of the time, then it's fine. I don't give a fuck.


EDIT: I was going to delete this in the morning, but it really blew up, so I'm leaving it, lol. 


For what it's worth, I know this isn't exactly the healthiest mindset, but I'm so goddamn tired of expanding so much energy on *trying* with nothing to show for it."
eacatg,Anxiety,I WENT TO A CONCERT BY MYSELF!!,No panic attack!! Yay!!
jyy7h4,Anxiety,Fuck corona,
9o5kkd,Anxiety,Does anybody get upset if they are going to be late?,"Even if it is a few minutes late... you get really upset. And if you're going to be very late to the event/meeting, you try to find an excuse to not show up at all.

I remember there was a day where I was late to everything. I remember feeling incredibly exhausted and frustrated with myself at the end of the day even if it was out of my control.

For me, being on time means that I am sticking to my routine and that things are going as planned. When I am late, I feel like a mess.

What can you do to make being late ok? I know it's not a big deal to those around me if I am a few mins late, but I feel horrible about myself. "
k5rszj,Anxiety,Does anyone else feel like they overthink literally everything?,"Any time I make a friend I am always filled with this innate concern that they secretly hate me. Even when I haven’t done anything wrong, if the person is reading texts and not responding I get stressed that I did something. I know that they don’t actually need to respond and it shouldn’t bother me, but why can I never seem to think that people might actually just like me for me?"
cjwdcv,Anxiety,Does anyone else get anxiety around people there own age but are fine with older people?,"At work im pretty confident and anxiety free but when I'm walking through town my anxiety is high.

Has anyone found a solution as to what causes this?"
fnkhwc,Anxiety,Call me crazy but I'm loving the lockdown and curfew thingy.,"It's really crazy but I'm lovin' it. I'm particularly not anxious about corona since my city barely had one case and barely 10 or lower cases in my state. It's all been taken care of, so. But still, with lockdown and curfew as precaution, I kinda like it. I went up to the roof of my apartment and noticed how quiet the world seems to me. It was kind of comforting. I felt at peace. There were no noise from construction beside me and the one in front of me. There were no noises from vehicles or people. The only sound were of my footsteps and the birds. Sigh, all the anxiety I had at home, vanished in mere second."
bmbb10,Anxiety,UPDATE: OH MY GOD YOU GUYS I GOT MY FIRST JOB!!,"I was already proud enough of [getting through just the interview ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/bkn5eo/update_im_at_my_job_interview/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)

but oh my god, I didn’t think I’d actually get the job!! I know I’m super late to this getting-your-first-job thing but hey, better late than never, right!? 

I’m just going to be bagging groceries but I’ll be making $3 an hour more than I ever thought I’d make and oh my god.. I HAVE A JOB HOLY SHIT 

I have a week to mentally prepare myself for training. Everyone so far has been so extremely kind, so I feel a lot better about the whole thing though I’m still shaking with nerves right now. The manager is extremely kind, the woman I just talked to on the phone was amazing, I met some of the people I’ll be working with and they were all so very nice. 

Is it stupid I actually want to cry??? I’m so happy??"
bkvh1h,Anxiety,"When I'm anxious, I procrastinate. After I procrastinate, I ruminate. Since I'm ruminating, I'm anxious to even get anything done, that I should have long started, thinking, ""What's the point of doing it now, remember the first time you tried and failed by procrastinating ...""","And I wonder why I am losing control over my life.

update: A silver and these comments down below - whoa! I was sleeping on this post, much like how that initial novelty wears off from anything on Reddit. But I did sign-up for gym in the meanwhile, after 8 odd years of reluctance. As u/Basith_Shinrah pointed out in a comment down below,“*You put it in words. I feel that's the first step in overcoming it*”."
719tk4,Anxiety,"Here's to all of us at work who have snapped at colleagues, cried quietly at desks (or bathroom), had panic attacks and ruminated about it for hours on end!","We are doing the best we can. It's not easy, struggling and working at the same time. We are not failures. Don't give up!"
l1wm8k,Anxiety,Does anyone else's anxiety give you physical symptoms even hours after you actually got anxious?,"So it's almost 5:30 and I can't sleep because my heart is racing. I had some bad anxiety a few hours ago, and I was also dumb enough to consume caffeine today.


Edit: Wow, I didn't expect so many people to relate! I'll try to read/reply to as many comments as I can when time permits. And thank you soooo much for the silver, helpful, and wholesome awards!! :)"
cp6eiy,Anxiety,Posting literally ANYTHING is so fucking stressful,"I've had an account for 3+ yrs and have barely any karma bc I'm too anxious to post on any subreddit or even comment most of the time :(

lv7rpq,Anxiety,Does the anxiety of anyone else manifest as anger?,"I feel like my anxiety manifests as anger, and I really don't know why. Some people develop trembles, they cry, or have an outright anxiety/panic attack (I've had a few of the latter). 

But when something negative happens, or my nervous system is worn out and I can't take it anymore, my fight or flight response just goes into full fight---I develop a really bad temper, and I'm impersonal, and that sort of thing. Why is this? Is it because I grew up with parents who had quite a temper? Can it be fixed?"
jhl2o7,Anxiety,Am I the only one who starts feeling anxious when they're actually feeling fine and good?,I don't know what it is but today when I'm feeling fine and just in a great condition in general I'm feeling even more anxious than I used to feel before?? I just want to enjoy the day without feeling anxious over almost everything CAN THIS PLEASE GO AWAY :(

injt7i,Anxiety,Does anyone else get really anxious and scared when they have to go back to college/school after a long break?,Also tbf one of my teachers does bully me and so do many of the students but the thought of going back to college tomorrow is really stressing me out and making me really scared. I know that once tomorrow comes it'll likely calm my nerves a bit but still nothing sets my anxiety off more than going back to college

dlxd9q,Anxiety,Was suicidal with anxiety eight years ago...getting married on Saturday.,"Eight years ago today I had had enough and sat on the sea wall at midnight about to throw myself in. Single, victim of DV, no full time job. I had terrible flashbacks, panic attacks, couldn't sleep. Now I'm still anxious but medication has helped enormously. I have a permanent full time job I love, a partner I love and I got to see my boys become fine young men. See your doctor. You can get through this x"
g8fqgc,Anxiety,"Looking back on highly anxious times is so embarrassing, the cringe makes me even more anxious","You know, those times you constantly needed reassurance and you knew people were getting tired of you for it. Yeah, those times.

fu4pox,Anxiety,"Was finally getting my life together, then this whole Coronavirus situation happened.","I've made a lot of progress over the last couple months, in terms of both managing my anxiety and improving my overall life. I've been going out much more often and been stepping out of my comfort zone, but I feel like all my progress is slowly being reverted.

jfe6ha,Anxiety,I'm genuinely tired from overthinking and worrying about useless stuff.,"Someone hit me, so I could cry instead and divert my focus. Or take my heart out,so I won't feel the heart palpitations as I get anxious and stressed. It's frustrating and simply tires me out. Like, I can barely breathe. I'm so tired of this cycle of worrying and overthinking. 

Fuck this shit, I want to only focus on good things even though I don't have any, I'll make some, I guess.

Edit; I really thank you for your comments and helpful advices. It means alot.. Also, to the people in same situation as me, hang on, friend! We're all in this together."
iy9jei,Anxiety,Does anyone else feel an insane amount of anxiety in the morning?,"I wake up, and it slaps me straight in my eyeball, from my head to my toes I feel anxiety. For the first 30 minutes or so is just absolute anxiety, I don’t want to get up, I don’t want to talk to anyone, I just want to lay down and try to sleep to avoid that feeling (obviously I can’t)"
athgxe,Anxiety,Getting out of bed is really hard for me. Is anyone else's anxiety worst in the morning?,"My anxiety hits me the second I wake up. I feel awful and I have zero energy. I literally just want to lie in bed for the rest of the day. Waking up is hard for me in general. I have low blood pressure and I feel really groggy and dizzy when I wake up, so that makes getting out of bed even harder.

Once I do get up, eat,  have some water etc, I usually do feel better. But the problem is, mornings are hell for me, and some mornings my anxiety wins and I stay in bed till well past noon. 

Anyone have similar experiences, any tips? "
gfhkcd,Anxiety,"DAE feel like their anxiety was taught/acquired through traumatic experiences and the ""real you"" is completely opposite from the person your anxiety makes you?","For example, I can be really really anxious and unsure in social situations, but sometimes when I can overcome it, I find myself very easily and very confidently talking to people. It feels like that person is the ""real me"" who just gets smothered by uncertainty and anxiety.

As in, I don't think my personality is anxious or shy or unsure, but I so rarely get to see that part of myself because I'm constantly bogged down with anxieties."
bjjn70,Anxiety,If you are browsing and read this please take a moment and do this...," A moment to breathe. Take a minute and:
- stretch your back
- get your shoulders back
- unclench your jaw (important one - thank you u/SaltedBiscuitTV)
- relax your muscles and let your body feel its own weight
- wherever you are, imagine that your scenario is imaginary; you are alone and all noise or people are a sort of movie playing around you
- close your eyes (really, just do it)
- imagine you are in your safest place on earth (your bedroom, an island, near the sea...) -- you should do this as a sort of meditation technique, be careful with dissociation symptoms (I suffer from it but it helps to remove myself from the place I am so you do you!) - thanks to u/veraamber
- inhale deeply and hold it for a couple seconds
- exhale as slow as possible...
- repeat 5 or 10 times
- remember that right at this moment there are thousands of people feeling the same exact thing you are now feeling; you are NOT alone, think about it and feel that connection

Later:
- go on about your day and put the phone down when you can and if possible do something nice that calms you down later - you deserve it! Go for an icecream, snuggle in a nice blanket... 

- if you’re not alone let people know you need a break to feel better, it’s a great first step if you are ashamed of your anxiety or try to hide it

- when you have time, write down in a really small font size a list of things that make you feel calmer or relaxed (reading, music, whatever) - print it and put it in your wallet or anything you carry around because most of the time we just forget to do those things! 

When you feel overwhelmed, read the list and choose an item and DO it. It’s easy for us to fall in the trap of “freezing” and never do the things that we *know* calm us down. I have mine with a list of good things in life/things I enjoy doing/reminders that I’ve struggled for years and... I’m still here!

Have a good morning/afternoon/night, you are NEVER alone <3

EDIT #1: added one more step thanks to u/SaltedBiscuitTV
EDIT #2: thanks to u/veraamber for the reminder on ""imagining you're elsewhere"" might be harmful to some people
EDIT #3: as I am still in a very agitated mood and my legs are sore from all the stress I just realized... first silver thingy on here x2! It feels amazing that venting while I was having a hard time helped someone out - Thank you! :')

I am used to living an unpleasant life, bearing problems all the day and feeling nervous at night and deeply unhappy. However, now I COULD live the perfect life, but I keep asking myself why is everything fine, what's going to happen, if I have any disease, what terrifying destiny is going to punch me in the face. Because of this, my hypochondria is getting worse, I sometimes am convinced that it's not possible for me not to have problems in life, so I must have some deadly disease and every signal my body give to me makes me want to run to the doctor... Sometimes I can't sleep at night because I fear that my house will burn while I sleep, or that some thief will break into my home to steal something (even though we don't own anything valuable!) and doing bad to my family... Have you ever felt that way or am I just an idiot to feel even more anxious because I literally have NOTHING to worry about?"
jyl357,Anxiety,I had a package accidentally delivered to my neighbor,"Like the title says, I had a package accidentally delivered to my neighbors house instead of mine. Normally I would have stressed over it for days, getting super anxious about the idea of knocking on a strangers door (we just moved into the neighborhood a few months ago and haven’t met many neighbors), and eventually get so anxious about how long it’s been that I just never even get the package at all. But today I just took a deep breath, went over to the neighbors house, and knocked on their door. He answered right away and was very nice and gave me my package! And, bonus- now I know one more neighbor. 

Anyways this sounds like a silly win, but for me it feels like big progress. I’m proud of myself today

Edit 2: While I didn’t list this as something that helped, I watch a channel called Bad Lip Reading which is a channel who puts movies, politics, etc and takes out the audio, then puts their own audio in based on lip reading.

The moment they start talking it feels like sensory overload immediatly. I have to force myself out of the house so much. I am working from home, which makes it even worse. I DO feel lonely sometimes but then imaging someone being around is such an unbearable thought. 
It is NOT social anxiety, I am not scared of people or what they think of me, I just think they're unbearable and I lack the energy to deal with their bullshit. I used to be super extrovert some years ago, it all changed when I developed anxiety. 
I'm in therapy already, but it doesn't help, like at all. I don't wanna live and die like a hermit, but I don't know how to help it."

koyzrv,Anxiety,Anyone else feel a need to just get away from their life?,"Not just in the sense of stay at home in bed but to actually get out and find an ideal looking wilderness to just stay in. No phone, no contact with anyone other than someone or something you choose to bring with you and no concerns or responsibilities.

Hopefully I'd build a cabin, live off the land and just stay there with my partner (and maybe a dog) with everything that we need around us. There wouldn't be the need to talk to anyone else, no unecessary conversations and no awkward silences to make my anxiety go through the roof trying to think of what to say.

I've suffered with Social Anxiety, General Anxiety and Depression for most of my life and have always felt more at peace and happier when out in the wilderness and cut off from everybody else."
l3x18k,Anxiety,I (f22) negotiated with a car salesman by myself,"2 years ago I couldn't go anywhere alone. I would pick up friends to come with me to the ATM with me because the thought of doing something like that alone stressed me out so much. I wouldn't order any takeout over the phone, wouldn't be in grocery store without someone else and I couldn't go to work without having a few mini anxiety attacks a day.

Today I walked into a car dealership by myself, negotiated with a salesman  for 2 hours and got exactly what I wanted. 

Going into it I knew as a young girl that doesn't know much about vehicles, I would be a large target. I stuck to my guns, negotiated hard and got an insanely good deal. I called my dad a few times for advice, so I guess it wasn't completely me, but 1 or 2 years ago I could never imagine me even going into a place like that even with someone else, nevermind having the guts to go by myself and  haggle someone so hard. I had the option of my boyfriend accompanying me, but I chose to go solo.

I'm just really proud of myself. It was the first time I have ever done something like that. I feel like I've gained more confidence in myself, and doing something so out of my comfort zone has made me feel like I can push myself to do a lot more things than I think I can do."

Just wanted to put it out there somewhere since i dont want to tell anyone i know yet

Edit: Oh wow, so many of you responded and upvoted, I'm in complete awe! It means so much to me! Thank you so much!

Edit #3: I'm so happy i posted here! I felt so alone because I hadnt told anyone and you guys are so nice! I cant even describe how happy I am! THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH!

Edit #4: As a medical student, I think it's my duty to tell you guys that the treatment for anxiety is based on therapy and medication. Anxiety is due to your negative thoughts due to any past experiences. You need therapy to fix your thought process, and that decreases or even eliminates anxiety If you have really bad anxiety, medication will help you cope. But it's not the solution because your bad thought process is still there. Meds are good to get your symptoms in control.

You need therapy in all cases of anxiety. 

You do not always need meds. Meds are for those people who are having a harder time coping with their symptoms

And your first therapist might not be amazing. You have to search for one that fits you. You need to experiment with therapists till you find one for you, and when you do, have faith and trust in them!"
9zybdc,Anxiety,I booked my first therapy appointment!,"After about 10years of thinking about it. I finally swallowed my pride, was honest with myself and booked my first appointment.

kqr8kh,Anxiety,I wish my parents got me help when I was a kid,"I don't blame them, they are from a different culture, where mental health isn't really talked about, and they don't know much about it. My first memories are anxiety, that fear, I feel it exactly the same as now.

But I wish, so bad that they had noticed it when I was young, that throwing up from anxiety when I had to interact with people as a kid isn't normal.

I feel like if I had a therapist or someone to help me when I was young things wouldn't have gotten this bad, that I wouldn't feel like I was stuck. I wouldn't be so isolated, I wouldn't have felt so alone my whole life.

If you have kids, and if you can, please get them some sort of therapy or counselling, even if they seem fine, I don't want anyone to grow up like I did, feeling crippled like this."

Edit: thank you to everyone who commented. It’s nice to feel like you’re not alone in this world. I’ve often heard a dismissive “that’s irrational. Stop it”  when discussing this feeling and it’s so refreshing to see others relating and giving great advice. Thanks again everyone :) have a great day!"
ldb1h3,Anxiety,Consumed by regret after missing out on life for 26 years.,"I am 26 and have not lived. I've never learned how to swim, never learned how to drive, never had sex, never been in a relationship, and never left my hometown. I am a 15 year old in an adult body. Barely passed high school and college (<3.0 GPA). Got fired from my first professional job during college in under a year for performance issues. Graduated college and haven't found a full-time job after almost two years. Still live at home. Feel like imposter around people my age and younger in long-term relationships, marriages, and careers. 

I was diagnosed with GAD in my last year of university and have been through five therapists on-and-off over the past ten years. I was never really one to blame my upbringing for personal issues, but it's difficult not to resent my parents and society to some extent. Single mother, absent father, low-income household. The impact it's had is obvious, and I recognize the same emotional immaturity and dysfunction across my family. 

The acute anxiety I experienced in my teens and early 20's has shifted toward an increasingly all-consuming grief of my adolescence. It is becoming harder to wake up in the morning. My last hope is landing a decent job and being able to buy some lost time, but at 26+ it's hard not to feel like my inexperience is exponentially insurmountable toward developing a fulfilling career and intimate relationships. I struggle to convince myself it's not too late to live, and that if I manage to, the rest of my life will not be plagued by current regrets."
c05zqf,Anxiety,I drowned my baby sister in my mom's birthday,"First of all, excuse my English.

This happened almost 8 years ago, I was 8 and she was about 4.

It was my mothers birthday and we were going to have dinner with all the family (like we always do), adults were outside the house preparing everything, I was on the second floor of the house, with my little sister.

She started crying, it was her baths time but all adults were busy, so I went to the bath and prepared the bathtub, when everything was ready I put her at the bathtub, with champoo and that kind of stuff. I left her alone there and I went to the first floor to watch TV.

When adults came back they asked for my sister, I told them that she was upstairs, having a bath, they seemed worried and they went to the bath, I followed them, I didn't understand the situation.

When we entered the bathroom she had drowned, they took her out of the bathtub and she was almost blue and really cold. Everybody got really nervous, they called 911 and stuff.

So, basically I killed her.

The relation with my family has never been the same. I am still in therapy for it, I have tried to kill myself time ago. In addition I was adopted so I spent months thinking that my family was going to ""give me back.""

My mother has told me several times that it wasn't my fault, but things will never be alright, I know that she is still disgusted of me.

I will never stop feeling guilty, I am really sorry. There is nothing I can do to feel better."

fyg254,Anxiety,Does anyone else get nauseous when they get anxious but become scared of throwing up so it gets stuck on a loop?,"My anxiety is most commonly tied to my stomach. When I become really anxious (for no reason just because), I'll become nauseous (along with other symptoms). Except, while most people are scared of vomiting, I'm petrified. I have gone into panic attacks because I feel nauseous. I will do *anything* not to vomit even though I know it's completely irrational and stupid. I haven't been diagnosed with any phobia, but I'm pretty sure it is a phobia. Anyways, this anxiety will make me nauseous, and then nausea will make me more anxious until I'm in a feedback loop. It's sort of paralyzing, especially since I have GAD and GERD, so I am constantly in fear of throwing up. 

Anyone else?"
dtqvug,Anxiety,Does anyone else find it a little surreal that people just go about their lives?,"I don't know if I'm alone with this thought, but the idea that my friends can just go out is mad. Like people just get up and do. Daily stuff like catching a bus, going to the supermarket, going to lessons, all things I'd have to do with at least some level of panic involved. And people just get on with it.

Back when I was still able to go out, there were hours before hand of making sure I've eaten properly, washed thuroughly, at least 30 minute lie-down to calm. And then there's my housemate who just hops out at a moments notice.

It just seems... strange  


P.S. I was not expecting this many people to see this, I can't really imagine 900 indeviduals. There was 600 at my secondary school, that's mad. Thank you everyone for sharing your stories and perspectives. It's been a really plesant to read them all <3"
ia7nas,Anxiety,Does anyone else avoid the news these days?,"Hi, all. Is anyone else having to almost completely avoid the news right now? I almost feel like it's ""attacking"" me when I listen to it or watch it, ramping up my anxiety levels & frankly making me feel almost paranoid. I'm having to stay off Twitter entirely, and off FB as much as possible. It's all so awful most of the time, and there's nothing I can do about it. I feel a bit guilty sometimes, thinking that as an adult I've got a duty to keep up with the news, and also, as a Christian, I ought to be aware of what's going on in the world so I can at least pray for it. I have trouble even talking about certain subjects now, because it can set me down deep, dark rabbit holes and trigger a depressive episode. And, although I feel really lonely and isolated, I still need to be careful what I expose myself to - for example, a friend of mine keeps pushing really scary conspiracy theories which does my head in. I don't mind talking to her about almost anything else, but not that, as once I've spiralled down, it can be days before I haul myself up again!

I was trying to explain to my mother that I've got really burned out and feel hypersensitive. I'm not proud of myself for it, as I'm sure I'm not being very mature, but there's only so much fearmongering a person can take, and like many people (I suspect), I've been fearmongered half to death over the past few months.

These days, we're all connected 24/7 and there's almost no hiding from anything. We ""have"" to think about Covid all day, every day - we're not being allowed to put it out of our minds for even one second. When I was growing up, we had news programmes, of course, and newspapers, but somehow, it wasn't in our faces all the time & we could take a break from it. Also, the media seems to have been more trustworthy back then, even if it wasn't - at least, there wasn't all this fear of ""fake news"". Part of my problem these days is the feeling that i can't even trust what I read any more.

So I try to focus on other things: watching TV shows, knitting (I'm making soft toys to give to people to cheer them up a bit!), listening to audio books and podcasts, learning Irish on Duolingo and also praying, as I find that a comfort. It's hard though!

(I'm not saying I don't take Covid seriously, btw - I do. I wear a mask on the rare occasions I go out and keep my distance.)"
9af9ff,Anxiety,Calmed myself down from a severe panic attack. I'm proud of myself.,"I was able to use self talk to help me calm down. I was vomitting, dry heaving, and shaking. It lasted a good couple of hours but I finally got to breathe. Apps like Calm and Forest help!

Ive been crying off and on for the last 40 minutes and I need to get over it and move on. I wish I was more resilient. People make mistakes and not everyone is going to be happy with you all of the time, I need to learn how to bounce back and go back to getting work done not sit here and cry uncontrollably for almost an hour. 

Does anyone else struggle with this sort of thing? How do you deal with it? "

then i sit there. hours later running the conversation through my head. why’d i say this? or why’d i say that? these people must think i’m a weirdo. i could have done this or that differently and maybe they’d think i was normal.

kuzeih,Anxiety,Anyone else rewatch the same shows over and over?,"This past year has been tough on all of us I’m sure. I know I have been having an extremely difficult time with managing my anxiety. One thing that I recently noticed I do when I’m anxious is I rewatch shows or movies. It’s not something new, but its something I realized just now. I have rewatched The Regular Show in it’s entirety for the 4th time now as well as a handful of other shows. I have watched my favorite Disney films again and again over the course of this past year. One impressive feat (for me at least) is I have watched all of South Park 3 times now lol. It’s something that feels familiar to me I suppose so it helps calm me down? You’d think out of the thousands and perhaps millions of viewing options available on streaming services, I would watch something else. Just wondering if anyone else has these tendencies as well."

It's ridiculous, I feel ridiculous. Anyone have any solutions to anything like this?

k3m1gi,Anxiety,The worst thing about anxiety,"You know what the worst thing about anxiety is?


How lonely you feel during it. We all experience it on our own and even if someone is next to you, they still don‘t feel the same fear as you do in that moment.


All of us have to process our emotions and impressions by ourselves and that thought alone makes me feel so lonely.


The way I‘m shaking right now because I am so scared, no one is here and awake. I‘m crying and even if they were awake they couldn‘t help me because the fear is deeply rooted inside of me.


I just want a break man, I‘m tired of feeling like dying over things that have many solutions to it.


Generalized anxiety is a bitch"
bncqxj,Anxiety,After not leaving the house in 4 years..,"I can’t stop smiling right now! In June it will be 4 years since I left my house and today I went to the Home Depot and made a purchase!!!! Walking to the car to leave felt like I was walking into a war zone! It’s not far from my house but there is a couple traffic lights that scare the shit out of me, not to mention it’s the freakin Home Depot on a Saturday morning😬😬😬😬.  It was not easy and I thought I was gonna loose it a few times (and almost did) but I somehow kept it together. I am just so proud of myself right now and needed somewhere to say it!  There is hope out there🙏🏻.

Edit:  WOW, silver and gold!, thank you all so much, I can’t tell you how happy I am from all the support. I am literally having the best day!!!!!

gd34dh,Anxiety,"Does anyone have the thought of, f*** it if I’m willing to take my life, than how can I not be willing to just go live in HAWAII and work whatever shitty job I have to just to be there…?","Hawaii isn’t some cure for my mental health issues (and I just say Hawaii because I live in the US).   
 But I saw this documentary about HAPPINESS and it was about who the happiest people in the world seem to be. I noticed a lot of them were little villages of people on small off-the-grid tropical islands. Living off fish and the islands fruit. Simple life living, no bullshit societal stipulations that f\*\*\* with your head…. just the sound of a breeze, the crashing of waves, and the beautiful sunny landscape filled with the stillness of nature. 

Maybe no one relates to this. 

Maybe this is just wishful thinking. 

Maybe it’s just the concept of “if I’m going to feel like hell, I might as well feel it in an absolutely breathtaking place where things are just a lot more chill and peaceful."
9jnop7,Anxiety,Today I ate in a restaurant by myself,"I’ve had anxiety for around 6 years now, sometimes it is more debilitating than others and I’ve had a phobia of choking on my food for the past 3 years. Eating out tends to be a really difficult process for me even when I’m in company I’m comfortable with, I’ll often end up giving up and not finishing my meal because I think I’m going to choke on every mouthful. I’ve never eaten in a restaurant on my own in my life. 

Today though I thought “fuck it” I’m not living my life around this fear anymore, so I popped into a small Thai restaurant near my home for lunch. I sat at my table and I ordered some food and I ate. It was overwhelmingly liberating, I could have cried. It wasn’t easy to eat but I finished my plate and I’ve never been more proud of myself."

The interview went so well that they wanted me to fill a different position that would be way more interesting, pay more, and I’d have my own office. I was hired on the spot. 

Needed to share this with somewhere. Don’t have a lot of friends lol:)

Update: 
Thank you for the silver❤️ I had my first day today and it was awesome. My manager is great."
jmnvfd,Anxiety,"The little anxiety podcast I cohost just hit 10k downloads. I'm sure comparatively that's nothing, but it still feels pretty damn good!","I just don't have another space to share this kind of stuff, so wanted to share it here! We've also been consistent in releasing our content, which I'm proud of my cohost and I for, since there were plenty of times we could have reasonably justified not recording etc. 

Anyway, it took us about six months to accomplish that, which is pretty neat! Wild to think that people felt the urge to tune in ten thousands separate times! 

Honestly, during this super messed up time, which I know has been so damn hard for all of us, I'm just trying to focus on silver linings, and this feels like one to me.

EDIT: Hey! A lot of people are asking me for a link to the podcast - sorry for the delay! It’s called “[I’m Anxious About](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/im-anxious-about-a-humorous-podcast-about-anxiety/id1513328863?fbclid=IwAR3didtiHxUoU6IZYV4m-vFsbrFeKXH4MftnQkQWA7nRj9B8MP3I1usgdsQ)” :)"

9sxc0d,Anxiety,I went to the bakery alone!!!,"I'm 17 and basically can't do anything by myself. If there's no one with me when I go outside, I completely freeze up. But this morning my mom was sick so she slept a little longer. I went to the bakery all by myself and even managed to order a coffee to go :)

This is such a silly thing to be proud of, I know. But it's a big step for me. Anxiety has ruined so much, but things like this make me realize that I've improved - no matter how little.

Edit: thank you so much for all the nice comments! And I thought my day couldn't get any better :D I hope that every single one of you keeps celebrating your small but important victories!"
8w41ah,Anxiety,Happy Fourth of July to all of the anxiety sufferers out there who are stuck at home or having to make excuses to others as to why they can’t be somewhere. The isolation is real.,
cwre4s,Anxiety,Finally decided to woman up and visit a psychiatrist today and got told that I had severe anxiety and panic disorder and should've visited sooner. Hopefully will get my life back on track. My mind has exhausted me.,My brother said I deserved it for acting up idk what that even means but it hurt. You gotta take care of yourself cause even your family doesn't always care.
a4n1j6,Anxiety,Does anyone else feel like their friends and family secretly hate them and so you are terrified to talk to them and make things worse but you’re probably just being paranoid?,"Just me? I feel like all of my friends actually don’t like me and “put up with me,” or that every good relationship I’ve ever had I’ve ruined—even though when I’m being rational I don’t see anything terribly wrong that I’ve done. I just feel so much anxiety around them, as if my every move could ruin another friendship. Or I get so anxious that I disappear from the friendship entirely and that’s why they don’t like me anymore, because I abandoned them. It eats up at me. I’m so afraid to hang out with my friends because I’m afraid they will think badly of me, but then our friendship drifts apart."
a155sa,Anxiety,I’m very grateful for my cat,"It’s 2:00am and I just woke up in a panic. This happens at least 3 times a week. My heart is racing and I’m breathing fast and I can tell that a tunnel of anxiety is about to consume me. Initially I don’t know why- probably a nightmare but I can’t remember what I was dreaming about. Then I start thinking about everything I have to do today and all the time I wasted yesterday laying around the house when I should have been getting things done. My heart is still pounding in my chest and I feel nauseas but at least my breathing has slowed.

Then, also as usual, my cat jumps on my chest, lays down and purrs softly. Focusing on petting her slowly and listening to her purr drives the anxious thoughts from my mind and gives me something else to focus on. She usually sleeps on the end of my bed but always stays on my chest until I fall asleep again.

I don’t know what I would do without her. She does this when I’m awake and anxious as well but it really helps me fall back asleep at night.

This will probably get buried but I just wanted to share. "
etar9a,Anxiety,I took a shower today!,"I haven’t showered in almost a month beforehand but I finally showered today. With super hot water and was in there for like an hour it felt so nice. I always told my mom about my anxiety and we’re gonna go to a clinic today to check on my body. I’m very scared, very nervous, VERY anxious, but it’s for the best and I know I can’t keep pushing this. Hope it all goes well!!! <3"
dtygyl,Anxiety,Anyone just feel cloudy minded from anxiety? Like you can’t think straight but you can still function?,Like does anyone else get the feeling that their head is inflated and pressury and you feel like you can’t think but you can still function just fine? Just wondering if this is just a me thing or not.
biwafy,Anxiety,Does anyone’s anxiety manifest as irritability or negative thoughts towards yourself?,"I have a lot of physical manifestations from anxiety like chest tightness, nausea, headaches etc., but I find I often get irritable if I’m in a social setting for too long. I’ll snap at the people around me, I get disoriented and withdraw. 

As well, I notice a tonnnnn of negative self talk. Maybe this isn’t so much anxiety, but I notice it nonetheless. For example, I had to write a paper for one of my classes and ended up doing extremely well on it, and I couldn’t just accept that I had done well. I kept thinking things like “oh maybe everyone did well” or “maybe the prof just graded everyone really easily.” I also get irrationally angry at myself for having my anxiety in the first place. I’ll catch myself saying things like “why is your heart beating so fast, my god you’re just getting on the bus, it’s not a big deal.” 

Anyone else? I’m curious!

Edit: Thank you for all the upvotes and comments everyone!!! I really thought the irritability and negativity was uncommon with anxiety, it’s so comforting to know it’s not. Thanks for sharing your experiences with me, it helps me more than anyone will know."
edx16n,Anxiety,I haven't self harmed in one whole year.,"The last time I self harmed was about a year ago. (I know, even more depressing because it was near Christmas!)

I have been dealing with anxiety and self harm for three and a bit years now. I didn't ever think I would get a mental illness and the fact that the self harm evolved from that was even worse. It's so weird to think that this one thing happening in my life changed everything for me. It was all very sudden as well. I started locking myself away from friends and family, school became a hell hole and I was just alone with no idea what was going on with my head.

 I never got treatment. My mum tried to get some woman to help me, she came to our house and I swear to god...she was useless. I appreciate the fact that my mum wanted to help but there was apart of me that didn't want the help. I'd been living with this monster for so long, it started to feel like apart of my identity now. I was scared that I wasn't 'ill enough' or I would be wasting my time there, they wouldn't actually care and they were just greedy for money. Thinking about it now I understand how crazy that sounds of me to think like that but who could blame me from the state I was in?

My dad started to notice and became infuriated with me. It's difficult to explain to people who haven't gone through it, so that just made it worse. A few people that did stick around would pop up on my phone, and it was constant. They wanted to know how to help and even I didn't know what exactly was wrong with me. How can someone help if even you don't know what's wrong? I had completely lost touch with the real world.

Three years later, it's still extremely difficult but I persevere...because even though you may think it can't get better, it always does. I used to RAGE when ever anyone told me that but it's true.

To be honest, I don't think I will ever overcome my mental health, but I've been doing incredibly better thoughtout those three years. I've grown as a person, I've learnt new things, experienced new happy memories and I'm actually going to have a clean, joyful Christmas. This present time in my life is currently the happiest I've been since. The best part is that I'm thankful. Of course there are days when I think I wish it wasn't around but my mental health has taught me so much and made me stronger. I am thankful! So...THANK YOU ANXIETY! THANK YOU!

Remember to love your brain and your body. You only get one life, spend it the best way you possibly can. Give yourself breaks, if you are having a shitty day don't force yourself into anything, take a day off and pick yourself back up the following day. Don't let anyone tell you that you aren't 'ill enough' to get treatment or that your mental health makes you 'worthless'. There is so much more to life than pain and suffering.
And most importantly... Congratulate yourself for getting past even a couple of days, a few weeks, a few months. It might not seem like much to you but every extra day you don't self harm, you are beating it! I believe in you all.
Learn to love your brain <3

Merry Christmas guys x"
8xlqik,Anxiety,Guys—for the first time in my life I stopped a panic attack before it started.,"I felt my panic attack coming on while on my way to a talk at a recent conference I attended. It always starts with vertigo for me, and quickly leads into feelings of fear, claustrophobia, and the inability to catch my breath. Usually, the second I feel that dizziness hit I know there’s no stopping the panic attack that follows it. I hole up in the nearest bathroom stall and resign myself to riding it out, a process that can take hours and often results in DAYS of constant vertigo afterwards.

I felt it coming on as I was headed to the talk, but it was a talk I was really interested in so I was like “oh no you don’t!” I focused my mind on some mindfulness techniques i learned in therapy—namely, the technique of observing my surroundings closely and mentally taking note of them (there is a red backpack in the corner, the man next to me is wearing black shoes, one of his shoelaces is untied, the room smells a little bit like sweat, etc) and GUESS WHAT. For the first time EVER, without medication, I got the panic attack under control. And I was able to enjoy the talk and get a lot out of it!

I’m so proud of myself, you guys. I had to share because I want you all to know that even if you’ve been struggling for years, there ARE mental techniques that can help keep panic attacks from hitting. We can do this! We don’t have to be anxiety’s bitch! And that’s the best feeling in the entire world."

i5hlpf,Anxiety,PSA: Ambient background videos on YouTube have helped my anxiety tremendously. I think you should all give it a try.,"I'm not sure how I stumbled across these videos (and I won't link any since I don't want people to think I'm spamming), but if you search for ambient background videos, they're pretty awesome. I work from home and they've helped my anxiety tremendously.  
 
For example, you can search things like ""Rain city background"" or ""medieval town ambiance"" or ""crackling fireplace and rain background"", a lot of YouTubers have uploaded thousands of videos that you can just leave playing in the background.  Last night I slept to an International Space Station ambient video.  

Sometimes what I like to do is black out all the blinds, turn off the lights, and play some haunted house fireplace ambient video. It's just so relaxing."
94xyqt,Anxiety,DAE get messages from others that you are too anxious to read and then get anxious all over again the longer you don't reply?,"Basically the title. I get so anxious opening work related (and in general too) messages/DM's because of the need to reply since the sender can see that you've read said message to the point of rarely opening them now. Well I feel great for a day and then my anxiety increases more and more the longer I wait to read the message. I'm to the point that I want to let someone else open all of my messages and relay the info to me, but some of the message chains have so many unread messages that I'm now afraid of just seeing/hearing bad news related to not opening the prior message that'll make me even more anxious. 

I'm in this inbetween area it feels like where I keep telling myself that tomorrow I'll open all of them so it subdues my anxiety a bit and this keeps going on daily. I literally have no valid excuse to tell these people either so I feel like I'm just intentionally screwing myself over and probably causing problems (that I haven't even read about yet in the unread messages).

I dug myself this hole and hate feeling anxious all the time from it, but also hate how I feel slightly less anxious just ignoring it.

Edit: Thanks everyone just for even replying, it strangely feels good to know that I'm not alone at all in feeling this way. Tomorrow I'm biting the bullet and going to go through all accounts (or what I can in the time I'll have) I can think of to reply to or delete messages and emails. Typed out a few replies for different situations that I'd been avoiding so I have no feasible excuse now! I'm bound to have a couple angry replies but I figure the quicker I reply the quicker I can sum up our conversation and never talk to them again! Thinking about it in that sense makes me just every so slightly excited to get rid of all the message baggage."
cfbfvy,Anxiety,First anxiety attack in front of boyfriend,"My boyfriend and I have been friends for nearly 2 years and have been dating for four months. Yesterday was the first time I had an anxiety attack in front of him. He has known that I have anxiety but he's never seen it first hand.

Well yesterday, I was hanging at his place anime on his computer when all of a sudden my anxiety overwhelmed me. I went to his bathroom for a minute hoping it would pass and then I broke down, I realized that I had been in the bathroom for too long so I quickly washed my face and went back out. Even though I had washed my face it couldn't hide the redness and puffiness of my face. 

At first he didn't see it because I was on my phone and hid my face with my hair, and then he laughed and pointed at the screen and looked over at me, immediately paused the show and went ""are you okay?""

That's when I pointed at my chest and through very narrow breaths said ""I'm.... having... an .... anxeity... attack""

He asked why, and when he realized I couldn't talk he grabbed my hand and rubbed methodical circles. 

Throughout the rest of the attack, if I told him not to touch me he'd lay off. If I told him to touch me he'd wrap me in an embrace. He even pointed at me and looked at our dog and said ""Mom's sad. Give her love"" to which our dog jumped on me and gave me dozens of kisses.

I just... aghast. I'm so happy he reacted the way he did. But in my head I thought he would have hated seeing my attack and would've reacted differently. I'm so happy he took it the way he did and I'm surprised as well. 

But goddamn I love that man.

&#x200B;

TL;DR I had an anxiety attack in front of my boyfriend and I thought he wouldn't reacted badly to it, but instead he held me if I needed it and backed off if I needed it and I really appreciated it"

But then when I post it and get replies..there's always at least one person who is really rude and implies that whatever Im talking about is dumb.

It's like the world is trying to devour me

I just want this to stop but it always comes back, always 

I know its such self pitying bullshit but I cannot convince myself that anyone really likes me, no matter what they say, being alive is just so tiring 

I treat EVERYTHING like a freaking personal attack 
I twist every postive, kind thing the people in my life do for me and turn it into something absolutely unrecognizable

Its disgusting

I cannot make a right decision 

Posting this is wrong 

But I dont know what else to do?

But its wrong 

Writing this out has kind of been therapeutic so there's that? 

Its either I write this freakout to reddit because all other social media is terrifying rn (and people i know inhabit those, ew) or I keep scrolling through the apps on my phone endlessly while I hyperventilate 

I shall add another sad voice to the void, enjoy.

fafbum,Anxiety,Today is my cake day AND my actual birthday.,"And for several years I’ve down played my birthday because of anxiety. Anxious about the attention. Anxious about organising a party and no one coming, anxious about everyone forgetting. So I’ve just not told people it’s my birthday and I’ve not organised anything. 

But this year I did tell people at my work. I told people who I’ve made friends with online, I went out for a meal. 

It has been a great day and I think it’s the first time in a long time I’ve really enjoyed my birthday. It also feel great to have let down a wall.


Edit: thanks for all the birthday messages :) love you all."
ki7tos,Anxiety,I did it!,"I didn't let my anxiety control me for today! I didn't let it get me to run back home crying, I faced my fear and got through the whole school day, it was hard but I managed to do it! I'm sharing this because I'm so happy that I didn't let my fear get to me :)"
7xkl1i,Anxiety,Hey YOU,"Yes. YOU. The person reading this right now. You're amazing. I'm telling you because you probably don't hear it as much as you deserve to. Because you're battling some really tough things that most people won't ever understand. Because even though you're doing that, and it's hell, you're STILL HERE. I don't know if you realize what a major accomplishment that is, but I'm here to tell you, it's fucking incredible. You're INCREDIBLE. Keep fighting. Keep going. It's going to be okay. I know it doesn't feel like it sometimes (or a lot of the time), but it really will. You're going to have glorious moments of sunshine to make all this rain worth it. Those moments are going to see you through the storms. Because there will be storms. Maybe you're in the storm right now. You'll get through it. Because you're strong, stronger than you think you are. You're incredible and strong, and I know you can do it. I have faith in you. I'm here for you. 
YOU. ARE. AMAZING."

l9fl3p,Anxiety,Job hunting when you have an anxiety disorder...,"I honestly feel like if there was one thing that could perfectly trigger my anxiety attacks and tick all of the boxes that trigger my panic attacks, it would be job hunting. And it has.

Questioning my overall self-worth? Check.

Questioning my few skills? Check.

Panicking at long job descriptions where the words blur together from said panic and nothing makes sense because my brain stops functioning as my heart palpitates and my hands shake? Check.

Feeling like an overall failure because I don’t qualify for/get rejected from a job? Check.

Becoming overstimulated and hyperventilating from the sheer amount of positions to scroll through? Check.

“They expect *all* 45 bulletpoints of this from me? I’m not capable, I’m just a jack of all trades, my brain would explode on a daily basis, I can’t do this.” Check. 

Re-doing my resume 35 times because it’s just never *perfect* enough? Check.

Not being able to decide what I want to do with my life and thus experiencing an overwhelming desire to just give up? Check.

Catastrophizing my situation, which then turns into full blown panic attacks on a weekly basis because I haven’t heard back from any jobs and thus being convinced I’ll be unemployed forever? Check.

Job hunting is a soul-sucking experience for everyone involved. At the same time, I’m convinced it’s one of the most unbearable experiences for people who struggle with GAD. Or at least it seems to be for me.

Typing this after waking up today to find myself finally recovering from two straight days of panic attacks coupled with some fabulous depressive episodes thrown in. I was knocked completely out of commission after a week of overworking myself with the job hunt, and spent two days crying, shaking, taking Ativan when needed, and feeling like “nothing will ever be okay again”.

*Sigh.*

Back at it.

**EDIT**: Wow. Came back to this post late in the day and didn’t realize how much it had been noticed. Thank you guys so much for the kind words, the advice, and the support- and for sharing your own relatable stories. I wish things were easier and I know we struggle like hell, but here’s to everyone who commented hopefully landing a job they love, despite all of this. Thanks again for all of the support and for making me feel *far* less alone in my thoughts/struggles. Even though a lot of the comments were you guys simply relating to what I wrote, that in and of itself was so helpful to hear (and I really wish nobody else had to feel this way...but there’s comfort in knowing I’m not alone). You’re all amazing humans. ❤️ (and thanks for the the awards!)"
dh91w5,Anxiety,"When the day is over, let it go. Don't dwell on what you could've or should've done. Tomorrow is another day and another chance. If it's meant to be, it will come again.","No worry can change the past, it serves you no purpose to dwell on things that cant be changed.  Tomorrow is a new day and new opportunity to change how you see and live your life.  

How you chose to view the affects of your past rest purely with you and your perspective on life.  Try find the positives in what comes your way in order to break any negative trends you may have created.

When you find harmony and good in things around you, you'll find yourself.  We have to break the cycle off negativity in our lives in order to be open to the good around us.

k5xlxc,Anxiety,Does anyone else preemptively 'mourn' the loss of your family?,"My obsession with death is always just me trying to cope with the idea of losing any member of my family.

Late at night, I find myself thinking of losing my husband or son and I 'grieve' for hours. Sometimes I think of my own death and cry too-- not because of being afraid of death but because I don't want to leave my family behind. The idea that life is so fragile and one day things can drastically change scares me so much. I saw this happen to my brother in law who died from colon cancer. I'm so scared of our lives turning on a dime like that.

I used to be like this as a kid too-- but with my parents. Somehow this obsession is much worse now with my own tiny family."

cqhkc3,Anxiety,I brushed my teeth!,"Hi, everyone.

I don't tend to post here but I really wanted to tell someone that would not be disgusted by me. 

I have been deep in depression and anxiety for about 6 months. I went to the dentist in May due to an emergency. The dentist explained to me that I have beautiful teeth that just need some TLC after not brushing them for years. I remembered that about a year ago in Aug 2018, a friend gave a company-wide training on dental health. She urged everyone that electric toothbrushes are the best way to clean up dental health quickly.

With all this information in mind, I've been saving up money to go out and buy a Sonicare toothbrush with a gentle whitening toothpaste formula. Today, I finally did it. I bought everything I needed. I brushed my teeth for the first time in months. I have no more plaque buildup. I set an Alarmy reminder twice a day to go take a picture of a bar code on my bathroom mirror so I remember to brush my teeth. 

I'm crying because I finally did it. My teeth might just be saved."

gms6fi,Anxiety,"Does anyone that has dealt with depression /anxiety pre Covid19 feel even more out-of-sync with their peers even tho “everyone” is struggling with mental health, sadness and anxiety?","I’m just trying to figure out if it’s just me. Some days I feel supercharged and extra supportive of my friends who are struggling and don’t respond to texts, video calls, online game sessions, invitations to virtually hang out, not being invited to virtual gatherings between friends, etc. I’m like “I get it, that’s ok, I understand because I know what depression is like...”

but then my (well-established) struggle with loneliness and rejection = lack of value and self-worth makes me really angry offended, then sad because I feel “god I must be so terrible, that’s why people would rather not communicate with me and instead communicate with others” 

Then I reach out or try to communicate my situation gently, (even asking honestly AITA). the response is more like “Hmm tbh I haven’t really been putting effort into doing things or seeing people. Not that I don’t ask to do things but... I just am not expecting to do anything maybe? Or expecting people to do things with me? And so, if people reach out to me, that’s cool. But if they don’t, I’m not reading into it.”

All of that sounds extremely healthy and understandable, so I repeat the cycle again. I can’t seem to feel normal in this world. It’s like dancing off beat all the time. I feel like most of my life I have been unselfishly receptive to what others are struggling with (since I’ve been there so long).

I just don’t know how to relate I guess."

Just go on and don't think... You can achieve everything you ever wanted.

Today concludes the second week in which I sleep early and wake up comfortably. Besides complying with 5 meals a day, especially breakfast which I missed SO MUCH.

At first I was fine, I just did my best to stay home when I wasn’t at work. Since the fall things have slowly been getting worse, I’m constantly worried that any slight change in how I feel is covid-related, and I’m terrified of being the reason someone I care about dies of covid. It’s affected my appetite, making me lose weight, made me cry much more often than ever before, and avoid seeing even the two friends I decided to share a “bubble” with when this all began.

hn7wgd,Anxiety,"Does anybody else feel tightness in the chest and sinking feeling every morning before an ""event""...ANY event?","Tl:dr: Am I weird for waking up with a sinking feeling in my gut on my birthday? Or is this what excitement is?

Today is my birthday. I am not big on birthdays, I don't like to celebrate it and in my opinion, this day has nothing to be celebrated about, being born was neither my choice nor my accomplishment.

Anyway, I woke up this morning at around 4 am, which is not my normal time of waking up, and I had this tight feeling in my stomach and this sinking feeling in my gut like something bad was gonna happen, I don't know how to describe it.
I am not new to this feeling, I have had it for years, before every flight I had to take, no matter what time of day, before any meeting early in the morning (even if it is a casual meeting where nothing is at stake), even so much as if I had planned to do anything in the morning, I would wake up with this weird engulfing feeling. It used to happen everyday a couple of years back, but now it's reduced to only when there is ""something"" happening..any something. 

I always thought this is my anxiety but today, it's nothing today, it's a birthday but I have absolutely nothing planned, I live with my parents and they couldn't care less about this day and I really don't want to think of this day as anything special. Why the hell am I waking up with this weird thing in my gut..is this what excitement is? Am I subconsciously excited about my birthday?

I haven't felt excited in a long time so maybe I have forgotten what it is?"
cc7boe,Anxiety,Does anyone get anxiety from feeling like you're wasting your time?,"I've noticed that a pretty consistent trigger for anxiety is feeling like I'm wasting my time or other people are wasting my time. I'm currently doing a summer internship and mentally noted a few ""productive"" things I wanted to do in my freetime (such as reading books or learning HTML/CSS or working out). However, when I get back from work I find myself aimlessly scrolling through reddit or watching youtube videos. And my heart starts racing more as I become aware of how much time I just wasted. At that point, I feel so panicked that I can't do anything productive OR relaxing.

I think this is related to a fear that's often at the back of my mind - of aging and not doing anything important with my life. I place too much importance on developing new skills so then I'm scared of failure and am too anxious to do anything. For example, I bought a course to learn Unity but the thought of not grasping the material and failing to deliver  something good-looking makes me too scared to even start the program"

f1t9o0,Anxiety,"It's really hard to ""be strong and carry on"" when all I want to do is curl up in bed and go to sleep.","I feel so tired and anxious right now, and I have so much to do, both at work and at home. There is no time to ""be weak"" or fall apart, because there's too much to do and too many expectations that I feel like I have to keep carrying on. 

I have an amazing support system in my partner, who keeps me grounded and sane, but I've had a day that started in anxiety and continued in anxiety, and will undoubtedly end in anxiety. I don't want to be strong, do chores, make dinner, stay calm at work, be in a good mood when I get home. I just want to go home, crawl into bed, and cry.

More than anything, I want to live in a society where it's okay to be weak, it's okay to fall apart, it's okay to take time off of work, not because you're physically ill, but because you're mentally ill. Where bosses know how to support their employees who are mentally ill, and check in with them, and put structure around them that allows them to still continue on with work, but not feel scared they'll get fired if they keep calling out of work or have a bad day or react badly in a meeting because they're stressed out, overworked, overwhelmed.

I'm just tired and anxious and scared, and I want to be able to feel those things and know that the world will continue on. But I can't, I have to be strong and push it all down and ""carry on,"" so that the world doesn't fall apart, and it makes my anxiety all the worse."

Thanks to two very close friends I've been able to find ways around the lack of spoons to bring myself to cook again and I wanted to try and share the simple yet tasty recipes with people who share that same feeling.

Whilst it's a LONG way in development, I plan on it being a completely free release because it's only aim is to try and help people !

In the latest blog post there is a long(ish) list of things I will be adding, but I would love to know what kinds of recipes you guys would like to see simplified yet still just as tasty ! It can be anything, (even unhealthy ones as there is ways around it!) Vegan - Vegetarian - Meat feast or mixed!

I would also like to know if you believe this could actually be helpful. I have received some good feedback from those I pitched it to (although the website is not at all as far advanced as the book, I'm still working on that!) I would love to have a wider range of feedback than my own little circle !

js3qdw,Anxiety,"You turned me into this, FUCK school. FUCK school, FUCK school. FUCK school","The amounts of hatred I have towards school is immesurable. IT made me into what I am. IT gave me HUGE amounts of COMPLETELY UNECESSARY anxiety and depression. IT gave me computer and porn addictions when I was completely hopeless. IT gave me such a LOW self-esteem that I will probably never recover. IT made me a cynical bastard who feels only pity towards my hopeful and youthful self that doesn't exist anymore. IT ruined me and my psyche.

I never had enough money for therapy and my parents thought that I am crazy when I asked them about it. I never had a counsellor or anybody who could help me at school because NOBODY GIVES A FUCKING DAMN HERE. NOBODY but I could help myself in this, I feel so alone, I feel ruined and bent beyond fixing. I've thought of suicide many many times but I am strong enough to never do it. I've gone alone trough the inhuman coldness of the education system and everyone in it without hugs or anyone to tell me that it will all be ''alright''. I don't have any friends at all. I wish I could cry but i've been taught to ''man up'' and soak up all the feelings, I wish I could let it all out. So here I am letting it out.

I have a learning disability called Dysgraphia and everyone has blamed it for my mistake. No, it is not my mistake, it is just who i am. Nothing in school is easier with a learning disability.

If anyone is struggling. PLEASE look for help :(. I don't want any more human beings to be ruined by this POISON like I have.

PS: School and the education system can go burn in hell. WHO THE HELL THOUGHT OF THIS WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO????? WE AREN'T SOME FUCKING RATS IN A LAB THAT YOU POKE AT. Im so frustrated....

1. **Porn  addiction actually came from my low-self esteem. I think a lot of  people can relate to this. It's kind of like a loop to be honest**
2. **I respect a lot of good teachers out there that try to do good things. I never said i hated EVERYONE AND EVERYTHING in school.**
3. **Despite  a minority of people disagreeing with me and calling me overdramatic, i  would just want to point out that i am venting and not stating  anything.**

fma7vw,Anxiety,I’ve just gone 1.5 months without an anxiety attack!,"I haven’t had one since January. Although I had one tonight, I’m glad that I made it this far because it used to be worse. Before, I was getting them a few times per week and it was quite debilitating. I still have work to do. I had one because it was over a topic that I haven’t covered in therapy yet. However, I’m just glad that I’ve made this accomplishment. 

To anyone that struggles, (this is really cliche) it does get better over time. It may not feel like you’re going anywhere, but I can guarantee that you are. Whether it be a small accomplishment or large, progress is being made."
ebvl46,Anxiety,DAE's anxienty always make you assume that poeople are mad at you?,"I came to my dorm today to find my roommate studying for his finals so we only greeted each other, I sat down and let him study. He didn't talk to me much either cus obviously, he was studying.

The whole time my conscious self knew that he's not talking to me because he's focused on whatever he was reading. My subconscious self tho, was yelling at me the whole time being like ""He's pissed at you, you must have done something to upset him and he probably hates you for it!""

This happens more than I'm willing to admit. The fact that I'm completely socially incompetent and often misread social cues doesn't help at all. Anyone else like that?"
8emp1b,Anxiety,does anyone else sometimes feel PHYSICALLY sick from anxiety?,"about a year and a half ago i had just found out my partner at the time had been cheating on me for 4 months, i felt stupid and betrayed and i felt like the blood in my body was moving around too fast? like my stomach had flipped and i couldn’t breathe properly and then i started feeling sick, i feel sick all the time. like at least once a day, so i wasn’t worried about it but then i suddenly felt something go up my throat and i had to run to the toilet and i was sick, quite a lot. i cried for a while and forgave them, it happened again but it’s over now and i’m with someone that makes me really happy but some things still make me feel like that, i haven’t been properly sick again since but things like exams and especially my speaking exam that’s coming up (next week) make me super anxious and honestly just getting up and going to school. i feel like i have to put in double the effort to do anything that other people do, and it really sucks."
a0k03f,Anxiety,A cool anxiety technique I learned,"**Step 1** - Think back to a moment when you were anxious or about a trigger that makes you anxious. If you are actively anxious you can use that as well. 

**Step 2** -Close your eyes and classify that anxiety. Give it a shape, a color or size and then picture it in your mind. Picture it and tell yourself ""This is my anxiety"". 

**Step 3** - Now change that shape in your mind. Warp it, shrink it, change the color to something calmer and send it away. Realize you are in control of how you interpret these feelings and that just as anxiety can enter your mind, it can also leave. 

It's not an end all be all technique but I have found it helpful. This might be kind of weird for some but I've also tried giving anxiety a face in my mind, and then change that expression on the face to a smile. While doing that, also physically smile yourself. Smiling is not something you will typically do while feeling anxious, so just the act of smiling can trick your mind into thinking the stress and anxiety is not needed at this time. 

**Edit:** Since this got bigger I thought I'd provide an example for some people having trouble. For me my anxiety reminded me of a red spikey ball that bounces around my head. What I did was smooth out the ball, shrink it and change it to a nice shade of blue and watched it bounce away and out of mind. 

I think the purpose of this is to distract you slightly and give you a visual representation of something that's hard to define. It helps to see something literally change and show us changing our anxiety is possible! 

Good luck and have a great week everyone, you got this!"

My worst fears are trains, busses, public places, small space and being surrounded by many people. I had an appointment at my new psychiatrist and i had to take the train, luckily it was only 2 stations away, 6 mins or so. So I got on the train and i felt surprisingly well. I actually felt great. Then the train suddenly stopped between 2 stations and i was stuck inside, no way out. Well one way out, pressing the emergency button and prying the door open which would have probably gotten me in a lot of trouble with the police. Panic hit me immediately after the the train stopped, i couldn't breathe and i felt like passing out any second. I got up and walked to the door and checked to see where the emergency button is. I actually considered pressing it. But the feeling of passing out completely overwhelmed me and i sat down on the floor and took deep breaths and tried to relax as best as i can. and guess what?

Don’t get close. Note I’m wearing a mask and staring at you getting closer like please stop!!!  Ugh. My bf is back at work (in retail) and these customers coming in for unnecessary BS is really setting off my anxiety. I’m trying to pick him up rn and I heard some guy on his way out complaining about how they’re closing early and all employees wear masks. Like wtf dude YOU could potentially die from this. Stop going out for random crap you CAN go without! Is it just lack of will power or do you really think this is all a hoax? Whatever.

I thought about cancelling my dental appointment, but decided to go anyway. One of the nurses heard me state that I was having a bit of a panic attack, and I might need to do the x-rays another time. She took me back to the X-Ray room, and instead of prepping me for it, she told me that she had anxiety also, and she was willing to let me sit for a while to calm down. We talked for a while, and she told me I was very strong. She told me that she knows the struggles of anxiety as well, and they are very real. She actually started crying a bit, and I asked if I could hug her, which she accepted. 

After my appointment, I sat in my car for a while just thinking. I called my mom to tell her about it, and she started crying too. It’s nice to know I’m never alone. "

8acm0d,Anxiety,When people say “trust your gut feeling” means something so different to people with anxiety.,"Not that I expect everyone to understand, but when people ask what your gut feeling is about something, I literally have to shut it down, because my gut feeling is always anxiety??? And I over analyze my gut feeling so much that it turns into negative. I know there’s obvious things that call for going with your intuition, but people who don’t have anxiety don’t realize that we over analyze and fear most decisions. Even when we know what we want, we still fear being wrong. Anybody else? "

It's exhausting having to live life as a panicky mess.

ibzmrv,Anxiety,So I hospitalised myself,"I suffer from existential pure-o anxiety.

That means I obsessively ask a lot of deep questions about reality, and the inability to find conceivable answers causes me a great deal of paralysing anxiety.

Currently I'm obsessing about the nature of time. Did everything come into being at the, well, beginning? Has something always existed? Has that something existed in eternal time, or a timeless/changeless state until time/events began? What caused them to begin?

None of the possibilities even make sense to me, and that really disturbs me.

So I decided to go to a mental hospital. Being in the calm, orderly environment helps a bit, and the doctor is very empathetic and really tries to understand what's going on in my head.

She is trying out some medications to reduce the anxiety, and other types of therapy will also be available. Luckily I live in Europe so I don't have to pay for any of this. Though food is pretty shit. 😀

Just wanted to share because, well, I feel pretty alone in this."
gozgvh,Anxiety,I am so proud of my wife,"My wife has extreme anxiety and when she does something that upsets me, that triggers it. It is super hard for me because I can never express myself in our relationship. 

Well tonight I was having a really hard day. I expressed it to her and she ignored me. She didn’t pick up on how hard my day was even though I expressed it very clearly. Later she could tell that I was even more sad and knew it had something to do with her. I didn’t want to go into detail because it would of set off a panic attack and I wouldn’t of been able to handle both my shit and her panic attack. I needed to take care of me tonight. 

So I tried to be as involved in our night as possible but let her lead and suggest what we did tonight. Obviously she could tell that my night was off and she started to become very distant. I got more upset at this because I wanted to be comforted. 

After a couple of hours she came out and said “ I know you need me tonight but I don’t know if I am strong enough.” She was talking behind a door and refused to come out. “But I just want to let you know that I love you and one day I will be able to comfort you.” 

After we kept talking she finally came out and I was able to open up and get the care and love that I needed. 

She didn’t have a panic attack. She did cry and almost went into it a couple of times but she was able to stay present and be what I needed in a partner tonight. 

We have been working on this for two and a half years and tonight was a major breakthrough. I am so proud of how far she has come."

ed5jr6,Anxiety,I got a 4.0 this semester in college!," I don't ever like to post anywhere about my grades, but I got two A+s and two A's this semester in college, making it a 4.0 for the semester! 

I've been told by therapists before that it's at least 10 times harder for me to do any given assignment in school than most students as a result of my anxiety. I had some really hard tests and assignments this semester, a hell of a lot of panic and test-related nightmares, but I did it. 

I'm at a relatively difficult college and I even suffered through a horrible kidney stone that caused me to miss two weeks of class and cost me a trip to the emergency room. I also had chronic bronchitis that caused a couple doctor's visits as well. I genuinely don't have friends at college or groups I belong in. I have depression alongside this shit anxiety and I went through this all alone, away from any family or anyone that could help.

It may not be much, but I did it, and I made it through. And you guys can, too! 

Please never hesitate to get the support y'all need. If you can, reach out to get accomodations with your school and if you get sick, let teachers know! Get doctor's notes. Most professors are more understanding than you'd think. 

Y'all got this! I hope anyone who's semester just ended had a great one, and everyone else have a great holiday break and happy holidays in general."

Recently I've been dealing with a lot more latent anxiety than normal. I've struggled with it for years, but over the last few weeks there have been a lot of days where I've spent the entire time with a pit in my stomach. It's weird - I'll wake up feeling totally fine, then the moment I realize I'm not feeling any anxiety, it's like a switch flips and I just start accumulating it right then and there. What the hell is up with this? I'm not even having thoughts about anything specific while it builds up, it's just like I can't stop something that my brain has decided is normal. 

I think this started while I was having a rough time with a friend recently. That situation has since been resolved, but the pattern of this gnawing feeling has stayed. 

Can anyone relate to this? I'm not sure how to stop triggering this and it's bothering the fuck out of me. I don't want to feel like I can't relax even on the weekend or after work. :/ "

My anxiety disorder is causing me anxiety. 

I just left a comment about not being able to sleep at night because my brain won't shut down and I can't stop analyzing everything that I said or did throughout the day. It went from 1 to 0 in less than a minute so I deleted the comment because it sounded whiny and a little crazy. Why do I care so much about what other people think? Why do I worry so much about how I come across to others? It's exhausting.

Maybe it's my unconscious nature to do so, in order to 'keep up' with people. I hope to get in the habit of slowing my speech down just a tad so as to stumble and stutter less. 

I've also been trying to think more about the state of my body.

asvvut,Anxiety,Does anybody else feel mentally ill with chronic anxiety?,"I know it is a mental illness in itself but I’m talking about constantly feeling “off”.. like way less intelligent than you used to be, hard to process your thoughts in to words so they come out jumbled or silly sounding, constant headaches and just feeling like you’re on autopilot looking in to someone else’s life.. Idk I’ve been dealing with this for 2+ years and I still find it hard to believe it’s just anxiety. I’m terrified it is something else that the doctor’s are missing which I’m sure is just anxiety fueled hypochondria lol. "
fxyye3,Anxiety,Does anybody else feel more comfortable in one-on-one conversations compared to group conversations?,"I (30M) definitely feel more comfortable in one-on-one conversations compared to group conversations.

dhjdml,Anxiety,It’s that time again.,"Just in case nobody has told you in a while, unclench your teeth.  Relax your shoulders.  Take some deep breaths through your nose, hold them for a few seconds, and release them.  Now, just breath until you’re able to sink in to your bed or your seat with your eyes closed. Whatever is stressing you can wait for a few minutes.  You deserve peace."
icv4t1,Anxiety,Just went to the dentist for the first time in ten years,"And it was fine! No cavities, good x-rays. 

When I got out of college I was broke and didn't have insurance, so I stopped going to the dentist. After a while I finally got a decent job and dental insurance, but my anxiety had become worse and my shame/avoidance behaviors kicked in. The more time that passed, the more shame I felt about not having been to the dentist. So I just didn't go. 

I don't know what changed recently, but the other day I just looked up a place with good reviews and made an appointment before I could think about it too much. I told them it had been a few years so I didn't have any x-rays to send over. Nobody made a big deal about it. The dental hygenist and the dentist were both very kind. Also, apparently these days they let you watch Netflix while your teeth are being cleaned?? Back in my day your only entertainment was the sound of metal scraping against tooth enamel. 

Anyway, thanks for listening. None of my friends know about this because I'm too embarrassed to admit to it, but I'm very proud of myself. And to anyone else struggling with avoidance, *you're not alone.* Please try and prioritize your health and ask for help if you need it. Whatever you're avoiding is unlikely to turn out half as bad as you fear."
g4y8e7,Anxiety,"How being ""gifted"" led me toward anxiety and a feeling of stupidity","I was what one would call a ""gifted"" child throughout grade school. I got straight A's, took honors and AP classes, scored highly on standardized tests, even skipped a grade. I never studied for tests or struggled with homework, I just naturally retained all the information I was taught. I loved reading, I would read at least one book each week. I never procrastinated and genuinely enjoyed going to school.

All those years of performing so highly in grade school led to me and the people around me having very high expectations for my academic performance. Unfortunately for me, I found it harder and harder to meet those expectations throughout college. No matter how hard I try, I am completely unable to retain any information I learn, which frightens me because unlike grade school, this is information that will actually be pertinent to my future career. I end up procrastinating until the last minute to study or complete assignments because I am afraid of performing poorly. Whenever I try to read, it can't keep my attention. I recently took a standardized test, and I just performed ""below average to average"". All of those ""gifted"" attributes from my childhood just kind of... disappeared.

Now that I am graduating, I'm really scared for my future. I want to go into the sciences, it interests me and I care about it a lot... I'm just afraid that I'm not good enough. That I'm too stupid now. That I can't keep maintaining this image of high-performance and intelligence. I'm so afraid to try new things like research because I am afraid that I am going to fail and look stupid.

I feel like being raised as ""gifted"" has caused me to feel extremely anxious and stupid now that I am in the ""real world"". I'm curious if there is anyone else in this community that experienced a ""gifted"" childhood, or high childhood expectations, and now suffers from anxiety? How have you personally dealt with this kind of struggle? Are the people around you supportive, or do they still hold extremely high expectations for you?"
btle96,Anxiety,Anybody else have anxiety attacks over mundane situations but feel totally numb over more serious situations.,"Like right now I’m freaking out because my arm is in a little pain and I’m at a friends house, it’s 4:00 am and I’m cold and I don’t have a blanket but I don’t wanna wake anybody up by going out of the room to find one or wake them up directly to ask for one. I’ve been pacing back and forth in the same spot for an hour and a half, all because I’m a bit cold and my arm hurts. Same thing happened when I spilled juice on a table at school. I started hyperventilating over spilled juice. And in slightly more serious situations, I feel totally numb and i disassociate. It’s like I’m not there and my life isn’t real. I had to confront my professor about a paper I didn’t turn in yet and when I was about to talk to him, I started to feel lightheaded, my vision stated closing in, my emotions disappeared and I started to disassociate. 

I’m sorry for this somewhat long rant/DAE question that probably doesn’t even make sense. I just hate myself for being like this and I just wanted to get me feelings out."

jqcuz4,Anxiety,Is anyone else just feeling anxious constantly at the moment?,"Normally my symptoms and anxiety are manageable, and I’ve done a lot of work to get there. As much as I have some bad day sometimes, they seem to be constant at the moment, which is probably symptomatic of all of the restrictions due to COVID and being stuck in the house, and not being able to do anything I want to be able to do. But just at the moment all my symptoms are horrible and doing the simplest things even feels like a struggle. Anyone else?"
j9tlou,Anxiety,I’m finally going to college.,"I graduated from high school in 2019. I’ve always been pretty smart, I made a 30 on my ACT and graduated with a 3.88 GPA. Everyone that knows me had high hopes for me. They expected college to be a breeze for me. I was supposed to start my freshman year of college in August 2019. On my first day, I had to leave early because I had a crippling panic attack. The next day I dropped all of my classes. I just couldn’t handle it at the time. I decided not to go back to school this August because I was unsure if I even wanted to go. But now, after some thinking, I think I’m ready and I applied to start in August 2021. I’m scared but I’m ready to take the leap."
epe6k3,Anxiety,I deactivated my Facebook and my anxiety had decreased by so much!,The daily pressures of seeing everyone’s posts and keeping up on every ones lives. I’m over the drama.

e1o8q0,Anxiety,My supervisor remembered my mood scale!,"I track my moods in my journal each day, from red, orange, yellow, green, and blue for an awesome day. It came up maybe once in a conversation how I track my anxiety levels.

Today was a rough day and my supervisor asked  what kind of day it is. I told her orange leaning towards red, but it really meant a lot that she remembered and wanted to know how to make it better.

Might be minor, but I think it shows how having supportive people around can be so helpful. The day is looking up at least.

bdoulg,Anxiety,Does anyone else lose their appetite when anxious?,"I’ve been anxious since I was a kid. It’s been pretty consistent my whole life but in times of stress it gets considerably worse. 
I 
just graduated college, which was a massive accomplishment for me, but I have been very high stress the last couple of months due to the anxiety of starting my “adult life”. Something that correlates with that is my loss of appetite to the point where all I can eat all day is one bagel, sometimes even less. Anything more and I either feel extremely nauseous or I start gagging when trying to eat. 

These last few months I have dropped quite a bit of weight and people keep commenting on it, telling me I look good. Which only makes me feel more anxious, mostly due to the fact that I know it’s an unhealthy consequence of my anxiety that I have no idea how to deal with. 

My question is, does anyone else ever feel this way? And if so what do you do about it?"
8fh0at,Anxiety,Does anyone else get anxiety when someone doesn’t talk to them? Like mine gets so bad like “oh they don’t like me anymore” or “oh they don’t wanna talk to me anymore” when that’s probably not the case. Idk how to handle it,
8r7ozl,Anxiety,Dont be me. A message to young people with anxiety.,"Im a late 40s guy who has lived with various forms of anxiety for a long time. 

I thought I could build a 'safe' life by avoiding. Constructing walls to keep the feelings of fear at bay. Keeping friends at a 'safe' distance. Staying up late at night so as to avoid daytime problems of the world. Work falling away. If I could just keep the fear and discomfort away 'today' I will let tommorow feel far away.

Except my tommorow has come. Living in a cold basement sleeping on bags of clothes. Only my phone and a cat by my side. I let anxiety master me, it tricked me into short term thinking and now my life is dark.

Dont be me. Deal with your issues. Dont avoid, the short term relief it brings is an illusion. Dont be me.

Edit. Thanks for all the replies. Ive often advised others not to lose hope, and I will now take that advice. Dark times overshadow at times but are not permanent. Hope you all know nobody is alone with this, thankyou again."

bbmwxx,Anxiety,I asked to change the tv at the doctors,"I was sitting at the doctors waiting for my husband to finish when the 700 club came on the tv talking about how Jesus healed mental and physical disabilities. I thought about just going to the car, but i finally asked about changing the tv. Unfortunately they just gave me the remote and some older people had just sat down looking directly at the tv. I wanted to change it to CNN but was afraid of them labeling me as a young liberal listening to fake news. So i changed it to local news. So now listening to a million commercials, but none of them claiming I can be cured by allowing Jesus into my heart.

But I did it!! I'm really proud of myself."

gqmycs,Anxiety,Does anyone else have intense fear that they’ll never be independent and have to rely on family members or have fears of being alone? Im scared to grow up.,"im 19 years old. I live with my family (my mum, my grandmother and my little brother). I dont have a job and i havent gone to college yet (put on hold since the pandemic). I have an intense fear of losing my family members and being left to look after my brother and myself on my own. I hate even writing this out because im scared ill “jinx” it and make it come true. I have dreams of my family members dying, i always push them to go to the doctors if they feel unwell, i try to encourage them to eat well and exercise. I understand its not my life its theirs, but this is all just coming from good intentions of keeping them well because i have such a fear of losing them. I even have nightmares of becoming homeless after they pass.

Its just hit me recently that im really growing up and going to start becoming independent. Get a job, go to college, move out, do my own shopping, pay my own bills, drive my own car, start a family. I cant even walk around my neighborhood on my own.. thats how bad this is. I cant pay in shops, i need to get my mum to because im too anxious. I dont even know if i know enough to keep me going on my own. I dont know how to pay bills, how to drive. I always rely on my family if i dont know anything or unsure how to do something. Im aware that i dont learn, i just get them to show me and i move on. I think a part of this is because if i learn all these things thats the first step towards becoming my own parent and that scares the living daylight out of me. I dont want it. I want to be a kid forever and have people surrounded by me and not feel alone. I want to be my own person yes, but i dont want to be *alone*. I dont know enough to be independent, i know i dont. Im soo anxious to get a job, to drive. Its the little things.. like i have to mind the house keys and the car keys, i have to pay the bills, i have to walk up and pay for my own shopping, i have to go to the bank. Being 27 and living with your parents still is known to be “bad” or “unhealthy”. Apparently it means you arent your own person. I dont believe this because my Mum has lived with her mum all her life and she’s independent, to an extent. I want to be my own person, but i cant be independent im so scared of going into the world on my own.

Does anyone have any advice on how to handle my anxiety and outlook on this?

*(edit: i did not expect this to get so many attention i dont have time to reply to everybody but just know ive read all the replies and i appreciate them so much! its so comforting to know that im not the only one who feels this way <3 )*"
8uk3en,Anxiety,Something I wrote while experiencing crippling anxiety,

But I am getting weird anxiety over how I look and feeling super self conscious about my appearance all the time.

I've no idea why, it's not been much of an issue before. I definitely don't need a new thing to worry about! It's so exhausting that stresses like this never seem to truly stop, even when I think I'm getting better. 

Edit: I finally managed to read all these comments now I'm home from work. Thank you everyone for making me feel like I'm not on my own in this! Some of you have made me think I might need to try the doctor/therapist route again because I think I can only get so far on my own. Overall though, today was a good day!

iqahuc,Anxiety,Anyone else have their health issues brushed off by medical professionals due to an anxiety diagnosis?,"
Kind of a vent post, but has anyone else had issues with people in the medical field brushing off symptoms of physical health issues because of an anxiety diagnosis or other mental health stuff in their health history? I had a really bad experience with it this week. 
On Monday morning around 3 am I called my insurance’s nurse advice line with ongoing complaints of a rash that was getting progressively worse, spreading throughout my body, and causing unbearable itching to the point where I was unable to sleep for the second night in a row. I called the advice line for guidance on next steps on what to do. I was transferred to a male nurse and told him my symptoms and he said something along the lines of “Y’know I’m seeing that you’re a 24 year old with anxiety and your symptoms just don’t fly with me as a nurse.” This comment made me feel ashamed for reaching out for medical care that I needed for symptoms that I knew were real. After talking more he reluctantly suggested I go to the ED. I didn’t go immediately that night because the comments made made me feel like I was overreacting and that my need for care wasn’t important or a waste of time. I did go to the ED that afternoon around 3pm because my rash, itching, and fatigue were only getting worse. I was diagnosed with mites by the ER doctor and prescribed an anti-parasitic which has so far provided some relief. 

I’ve filed a grievance with my insurance because I feel like my dignity as a patient was violated and prevented me from seeking out care. At first I thought maybe this isn’t a big deal but after consulting with friends they said that this was unacceptable and that I should file a report. I’m kind of used to going to the doctor and having them brush things off as anxiety and it just seems like a vicious cycle cuz I never do anything about it because of my anxiety and not wanting to make it a big deal."
f7rcx6,Anxiety,"Does anyone else feel straight addicted to their phone, even though you feel as though it just intensifies anxiety?","I know people who literally leave their phones just off for hours or never check them and I’m over here like obsessively checking shit every five seconds. Partly because I totaled my car and can’t really go anywhere currently/not much to do in my town that’s walkable and partly because I use social media a lot to find things I need.  Like currently:

Moving states in two weeks and have about a month to find a roommate once I move. Facebook is great for this.

Also need a new (to me) car in the next month. Also need to use social media/the internet for this.

I like concerts so I follow a lot of artists and that’s how I get a lot of free tickets or pre sale codes.. and this requires scrolling through IG to find usually. IG is either mind numbing entertainment or just toxic to me. Seems to be no in between.

I don’t want to be a slave to my phone and anxiety and it’s not like I have no hobbies I can explore. I kind of just feel crippled by anxiety and it’s ironic my go to place is my phone. And if I DON’T indulge my brain and check whatever it is=anxiety. Catch fucking 22z

Most of the time, no one even gives a shit what I post anyways so I don’t know why I’m posting this in the first place. One of the only true positive places on my phone is the random acts of amazon subreddit. Everything else is just comparison, boredom, wondering why people don’t talk to me (which I know I partially do to myself), wishing I was not in physical pain all the time and posting about it and then immediately deleting cause I feel stupid afterwards... you get the gist.

I’m just in a super weird head space right now and I don’t feel very supported living at my narcissistic mothers house til I move. Or really much at all lately. Idk. I can’t even tell if it’s all just in my head at this point. I wake up anxious and sad and go to bed anxious and sad and I just want to be happy dude.

God sometimes I just wish cell phones didn’t even exist still. Simpler times. I don’t know what I need but all I know is I feel like I’m annoying the only people I have in my life who I feel I can truly confide in, because you can only listen to someone complain about something for so long....and it’s all just stupid anxiety.

I’m so over it. So much. 

Tips?"
a4h4ki,Anxiety,I get anxiety during anxiety about myself wasting my life having anxiety and not being able to enjoy it. Wasting precious time. Literally anxiety about anxiety? How do I break this loop?,"I get the physical sensations of anxiety each morning I wake up. Doesn’t matter what I do. CBT, meditation, mindfulness, meds (although no more) etc.

This in turn sets the tone for the day no matter what I do, then I get upset that I always feel like my body thinks it’s dying in fight or flight.

It drains me and fatigues me and then I make mistakes at work and affects my attention span. 

Then I always end up being in a state of having more anxiety because I’m scared about always having anxiety.."
gpr8c6,Anxiety,Every time someone is aggresssive with me it entirely ruins my day,"For instance, last night with friends I made the mistake of laughing at something someone said that wasn't supposed to be funny (that was truly my fault, laughing at this was disrespectful from me, I only realized it later), and the person talking replied quite angrily to me something like ""get out if you don't want to listen"".

And I'm still anxious about it, it's still stuck in my brain and ruining my day. The problem is that it happens even when I haven't done anything wrong and someone is just being completely mean to me.

I just can't get past it before a long time and it's annoying to not to be able to think properly because of that. I used to suffer from severe social anxiety in the past (that 'solved itself' progressively when I was a teenager) but that problem I described never disappeared, and I have no idea how to solve it.

jn9o4i,Anxiety,"Terrorist attack happened in my city yesterday, I feel like I'm going to break down","Yesterday evening my city was hit by a terrible terrorist attack. Five people have been confirmed dead. The attack happened in an area where I spend all of my free evenings. I don't remember the last time I met up with a friend and did not go there. 

The first time I read the news, I thought maybe it's just some people who got into a fight and one of them shot the other. It doesn't happen often but it happens sometimes, so I didn't think much of it.

Then a family member, who was not at home at the time, sent me news reports and videos of the attack. I feared for their life until I finally heard the door bell ring. I turned on the news and on national tv was confronted with uncensored videos of people being shot. I heard the fear in the journalists voice as she was walking to a safe spot. I saw the people running around, trying to reach any place where they would be safe. All of that happened in the heart of our city, where I had just gone for a walk a day prior. 

I am so deeply distraught and I don't know what to do. I would call my therapist but I wouldn't know what to tell her. I just wanna curl up and cry. The whole day long I've been pacing around my apartment unable to calm down. I feel like my heart is shaking. I've been diagnosed with anxiety almost half a year ago and I don't remember it ever being this bad.

The days prior to the attack I spent studying for an exam I have tomorrow. I was super proud of my progress. Today I do not feel like studying at all. I don't know how the hell I am supposed to focus and think for one hour straight during my exam. I fear that I am going to fail it now too. Everything is snowballing. A family member told me to stay at home but as soon as I think of that as an option, I feel like I'm faking it and trying to avoid my exam. This causes me to feel guilty which makes everything even worse.

I woke up every hour last night, and everytime my anxiety got worse and worse. In my head I saw the attackers shooting at my window, I saw them shooting at us while we were in the tram, the metro, the mall, even my university. I didn't feel safe.  Now that feeling of unsafety has passed, but only because I didn't have to leave my house at all today. I wonder how I'll feel when I have to go outside. 

Whoever read this far, thank you. I don't even know why I wrote this. I guess I'm just trying to deal with it somehow."

9xzrbl,Anxiety,Did your child self think that your adult self would be completely confident and have it all figured out?,"When I (f26) was in school I always imagined that by mid-20s I’d be completely comfortable in my own skin and wouldn’t give a shit about what other people thought. I just assumed that came with being an adult. Yet here I am, still feeling like I’m at the bottom of the food chain in social situations, and still just as anxious and doubtful of myself as I was 10 years ago.
It’s so weird. On paper I’ve achieved so many of the things I had hoped for myself... I should feel good about myself by now, or at least have enough evidence that I’m not a total piece of shit. 

Childhood me would be saying “how can you still not believe in yourself? How can you STILL be living so fearfully?” 
At this point I honestly don’t know what it will take to prove to myself that I am a perfectly capable human being. Anxiety wins every time.

EDIT: Thank you so much for all of your responses!!! I resonate with so many of you and it’s comforting to know I’m not alone in this!! I started CBT a few weeks ago and can’t say it’s been particularly helpful so far, but I plan to stick it out and hope for the best. "

I can't help it sometimes and when I talk to someone about it, they brush it off like it's not a big deal because I can't figure out why I'm anxious. 

I woke up wanting to eat my whole fridge today. Is there really a giant reason? No. People say ""just eat then"". They don't understand that if I do right now, idk if I can stop myself. You know? It goes with OCD too. You can't stop thinking about it until you act on the obsession.

fheyex,Anxiety,Anyone ever had anxiety that makes you not want to eat?,"For a little over a month, I have been having some pretty bad bloating, loose stool, inability to eat a large meal because of that bloating feeling, lots of gas and belching.  My doctor seems to be certain that its my anxiety; given I am healthy, no family history of any serious illness, and relatively young.  However, as we do, I cannot shake the feeling something serious is wrong with me and its affecting my every day life quite a bit.  I feel hungry and my stomach growling, but when I eat its hard to finish a meal.  I am actually SCARED of meal time because I am worried I cant finish the entire meal.  Plus, I have lost a few pounds over the past month which is only making me more nervous."
l7ey95,Anxiety,can we please stop minimizing & comparing people’s problem? your problems are valid.,"i’ve had friends that minimize or compare my problems. i’ve had teachers & therapists & social workers do it too. but either way... it needs to stop. 

i’ll use my old friend as an example. we’ll call her “A.” If i told A that i had a good day or did well on a test, she would roll her eyes & say “of course *you* did.” she always got mad whenever i had something positive happen in my life. even if it was as simple as getting something in the mail. 

she did have anxiety & depression, so i’m totally aware of what could cause he to act that way. i’ve been envious of others before & i’ve been depressed about how well other people are doing compared to myself. but it didn’t make it hurt any less. 

when i got my first job, i was over the moon. my family was so happy. i have *crippling* anxiety/paranoia & depression. so it was a *huge* leap for me. i didn’t leave my house unless it was to go to school. i was super excited to tell my friend. she got mad at me. that hurt a little bit. 

not to mention when i would tell her about my problems. i’m not a very open person & prefer to deal with my problems by letting them bottle up. i know, very healthy. anyway, on the few occasions that i opened up i was met with “oh well you should live a day in my life” or “oh you had three panic attacks? i has twenty five.” i’m obviously exaggerating but you get the point. i could tell A that my family was murdered & she would respond with “ya well my family has been murdered twenty times.” 

it doesn’t matter if you have anxiety or not. it doesn’t matter if you have mild anxiety or severe anxiety. your struggles are valid. anxiety is anxiety. it sucks. whether you deal with anxiety 24/7 or a couple times a year... your struggles are valid.

just please stop minimizing & comparing people’s problems. that contributes to why i don’t open up. i’m always scared that when i tell people i wanna kill myself & i hate myself & i haven’t showered in a week & i hate life & i can’t bond with people & i feel numb & i don’t want to have a future & i don’t feel as though i was created for this world & i wanna dropout again & i am desperately absolutely 10000% terrified of people (especially men) & my paranoia is keeping me from functioning & i worry about the future of the world & my meds aren’t working much anymore & i wanna be alone & i don’t believe in love & i never want any friends & i have an addiction to eating to cope & i can’t look in mirrors & blah blah blah- i’m scared that they’ll tell me to grow up. that my problems aren’t valid. that people have it much worse... which they do. 

anyway. please comfort people when they open up. you never know how hard it is for them. don’t compare other people’s problems to theirs. don’t minimizing their problems. pain is real. pain is valid. no matter how small. sending love & positivity to you all. 🌻🖤🌼"
kclmkb,Anxiety,idk who needs to hear this,"you guys are all so so so strong. you get up even when you feel like crap, you face the world when you feel so scared and paranoid and worried about yourselves. that’s strength. living your life in spite of all this stuff that happens to you daily. the way in which you all have the ability to get up, get ready and go to school/work and even though it feels like putting one foot in front of the other is the hardest thing. you guys still do it. you are strong. you can do this.

edit: thanks for the medals, lmk if you guys want me to post more tips and motivational stuff like this"
9kgj4s,Anxiety,Small victory: I managed to control a suicidal anxiety attack before it got too serious.,"Every day with anxiety and depression is a challenge, but it feels nice to count up these little wins. I've been having a lot of bad days for the past month or so and I've been trying to figure out how to cope. Happiness/contentment does seem far away and even impossible at times, and in the case today, it led to nearly catastrophic panic attack today.

I'll admit, it's been a long while since I've had suicidal ideations, which makes the whole experience a fair bit sour for me, but I least I can take solace in the fact that I recognized the signs before things got out of control. Being able to understand, ""Hey, listen, you're having a panic attack,"" and enact a plan of action feels kind of liberating. I was able to stop the attack, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't still under high anxiety right now.

eebgko,Anxiety,Anyone else constantly have an upset stomach due to their anxiety?,"It’s a very specific kind of upset stomach that I get from my anxiety. It’s not a stomachache, or cramping, or “maybe I ate something bad”, it’s literally feeling sick with anxiety. I think out of all the anxiety symptoms I’ve experienced in my lifetime of anxiety, this is the absolute worst one and most likely the main symptom that will force me to attempt stupid therapy and medication again despite never having a good experience with either. 

I’ve already ruled many out other causes, and I know it’s likely only caused by my anxiety. I just don’t understand why my body and mind does this to itself. I can deal with shaky hands, or worried thoughts, or my heart racing, but feeling like your stomach is about to burst open and spill your guts everywhere makes literally EVERYTHING 1.000% harder, no matter how happy you are to do something. No matter how much you care, or how determined you are to have fun, it doesn’t change a thing. 

It makes social events uncomfortable, it makes work extremely hard to get through. It just makes me want to curl up into a ball in bed and never leave. I don’t even need any suggestions for how to fix this. I don’t need to be told that I need medication or therapy. I’m just so tired of constantly feeling sick and no one understanding why or how it feels. No, taking a tums isn’t going to fix it. No, I can’t just “stop worrying”, or drink some damn ginger tea. I know a lot of suggestions come from a good place, but they don’t help."
bny3ti,Anxiety,Worst time for an anxiety attack,"Got pulled over today. I've been pulled over a few times before nothing scary. Today was different though. After the officer walked up to my car I started having a horrible anxiety attack. The officer noticed me shaking and started to press for why I was so nervous. He went back to his car to run my information and a second squad car pulled up. They both walked up and told me I needed to get out because something wasn't right with me and they needed to investigate. As soon as I explained the anxiety and depression I've been battling and showed them my new medication that I recently started. As soon as they saw that they completely shifted and asked if I needed any resources for them and were wanting to get an emergency crisis officer out there to talk with me and get me help. I've already have been getting help, but for some reason it was meaningful how much they wanted to make sure I wasn't going to do anything to myself."
acbd0s,Anxiety,Aced a phone interview and I CAN’T STOP SMILING. PHONE ANXIETY SUCKS,"Three years ago you would’ve never seen me pick up a phone. And in the rare moments I did, I’d either pass the phone to my family, or I’d be a stuttering mess and end the phone call hating everything about the call. I’d blank out on the simplest questions, or overthink every second of silence. It would be a never ending cycle of me flinching whenever my phone rang. 

And then I got to a point where I got tired of it. I was entering university and I couldn’t even make a phone call for myself without my anxiety getting the best of me. 

So then I asked my friends and family to help. I took it step by step, and just called them for a few seconds. They’d be there to help me calm myself down enough to be able to think. And then once I started gaining just a little bit of confidence, I pushed myself to make calls to other people. Sure I had to write scripts for every call, and anticipate replies so I could keep writing scripts accordingly, but nonetheless it got me out there. I started making calls. From booking doctors appointments to just calling to ask about food at a restaurant, I did it, and the pride I felt every time after the call was unexplainable. I still had those thoughts though, of the things I could’ve said better, the ways I could’ve changed my tone. But ultimately I reminded myself after each phone call about what I conquered. 

I just hung up a phone call today, from a scheduled phone interview. I didn’t write a script for it. Instead, I just did everything I would do for a usual job interview, preparing and researching as best I could. And then I just answered the phone call and had a conversation. At points my voice was shaky, but I know I have yet to grow. I ended up getting another interview - in person! Which, to me, is so much easier than the phone, so I’m hopeful it goes well. 

I understand how immobilizing phone anxiety can be, but I swear to you with practice and the right support it really can get better. If anyone ever needs, I’m here to offer calling practice lol, just because it has helped me so much. 

We can do this!!"
f6bpmh,Anxiety,I looooove when you finally tell someone you’re anxious and they tell you you’re making it up.,"Has anyone had a situation like this?

I’ve had family, professors, bosses tell me I’m just making up excuses.

In reality, I tense up, get defensive, want to crawl out of my skin. It’s hard to talk about but it’s even worse when I finally do sh my anxiety gets called an “excuse”.

My anxiety makes me come off aloof or like an asshole but I’m just trying to get through it."
ircthi,Anxiety,Is it just me or this pandemic thing triggered anxiety attacks on a lot of people?,"Since this pandemic started, I started having anxiety attacks. I have never had it before this. It all started april this year and it has been going on since then. I have been hering from a lot of other people that this happened to them too. They even thought they were sick too because of the shotness of breath."
j7r5rc,Anxiety,Night anxiety is the worst.,"I’m fine all day. Once I notice the sun go down, my anxiety levels go up in return.

Then once I go to bed and try to sleep. All my fears come out of the woodwork. 

Slight head pain? Stroke.

Chest is tingling? Heart attack.

It goes on till 1 AM to 3 AM sometimes. I fall asleep once I’m exhausted of thinking and my body is just shutting down for the night.

I wake up. Happy. Care free. Zero anxiety. 

The cycle continues."
dfedqj,Anxiety,Does anyone else here creates arguments in mind and hypothetical scenarios which affects you emotionally?,Whenever I think of some little scenarios which really is happening then later on my mind make it worse like it creates arguments with somebody and i feel like it is real like i felt it emotionally then things got even worse when negative thoughts coming out and i feel if that would happen it would be my fault. There were also times that i even felt i was about to cry just by thinking those things. Can somebody please tell me what i am going through.
af67nr,Anxiety,Does anyone else feel completely disconnected from who they used to be?,"I’ve been experiencing the beginnings of an attack for the past hour or so and all I can think of is that I’m not “me” anymore. Like I’ve left home before I was ready. I keep remembering that I used to like playing music in bands, I used to like to have fun with friends, I used to have hope and make plans, I used to laugh and joke a lot...

I used to be someone else. 

Now, Im somewhere else and I feel like an empty vessel who’s only purpose is to dwell on what used to be, but seemingly can never be again. Nothing seems to matter, and simultaneously, nothing makes any sense. 

It’s so hard to put into words how I’m feeling. It’s like... everything is blank. Empty. And nothing feels real at all. Like, I’m living someone else’s life. And what I do, what I say, what I feel- is irrelevant and pointless. I just want to go home and be who I used to be. But I know I can’t. That person is forever gone. Changed by this disgusting horror that’s consumed me. 

And finding out the cause of this is impossible. There’s no trigger. There’s not single thing that starts it, because it’s a constant. It doesn’t ever stop. I’m currently seeing two therapists, and on two meds, (anxiety and depression) and I think I’m getting worse by the day. It’s like- every day I lose more of me- in the process of becoming something else. I just want it all to stop. 

I miss me so much. 

EDIT: WOW! I’m almost speechless! Thank you ALL for responding to this. I wouldn’t have known that so many of you felt this way too. I kind of feel like that little bumble bee in the No Rain video by Blind Melon. I’ve found my people! And though I’m saddened that there is anyone that feels the way I do- I feel a bit more fortified that I’m part of a larger whole- and army if you will, that is willing to not give in to this problem. Let’s do our best to take the opportunity to become someone else- to become someone better! 

We got this!"
leot1u,Anxiety,Any of you also fell bad on Sundays?,"lately, every Sunday makes me feel awkward, I spend a lot of time thinking about work the next day, even though I am not anxious at work, I am anxious thinking about the next day's work,

also, i feel like i'm just spending my day off at home without enjoying or really doing something important, even though i like to stay home.

Do any of you go through this? how to deal? really bothers me for being every Sunday

lc2rl3,Anxiety,I just want to be normal,"I see other people who don't struggle with anxiety and everything is so much easier for them. For example: You are shy? Just go and talk to people. Meanwhile I can't event talk straight if I'm anxious. I fear people won't understand me and they surely may try their best, but goddamnit, I just want to not feel anxious all the time about numerous things, I want to live my frickin' life, fulfill what I know I'm capable of. But why does it need to be so hard for me? 

Sometimes I feel like I've not been ""made"" for this word. That I'm just pathetic, weak or whatever it is. I see other people having such an easy time, such a good time on this world. Why did I have to develop this disorder? Do I really need to cry myself to sleep every single week?"

Absolutely love it.
hreavp,Anxiety,Does anyone feel like wearing a mask helps their anxiety?,I work in a hospital and wearing a mask is mandatory for us (thank god).

8udbn9,Anxiety,Does anyone else get tired of people telling them to exercise as if thats a cure-all?,"I know exercise is a wonderful tool, and can be great at helping get rid of that excess energy while also helping maintain good health. But sometimes it feels like being told ""have you ever considered exercising or dieting?"" invalidates my current efforts to healing myself. I'd just like to be supported for finally reaching out to a psychiatrist and therapist. "

b137g2,Anxiety,Does anybody else feel like your anxiety has totally killed your curious and creative mind? Read more inside.,"What’s up y’all, hope you are all doing well.

Recently came to a bit of a sad but interesting realization. I was reflecting on who I used to be and what I used to think about when I was a young immature boy in high school and I realized something.

My mind used to be so creative and curious back then. I’d always think of crazy what if scenarios, where things came from, imagined my own world, drawings, silly stuff and interesting thoughts.

Now that I am older I have realized my mind has lost that spark. The only thing that ever occupies my mind now is what I did in the past, what I’m gonna have to do in the future, what this all means for me and if I’m doing good enough.

I just think about my problems all the time and what’s plaguing me and if I did the right thing or if I fucked up in life.

It’s kinda because it’s a self-repeating cycle. These thoughts only breed the same thoughts. So I’m like stuck in this weird unoptismistic limbo.

Anybody feel this way ever or make this realization? Thanks."
kgkjs8,Anxiety,Does anybody have a high amount of social anxiety but no fear of public speaking or making presentation?,"For me, I have a huge amount of social anxiety but I have zero anxiety with making presentations or public speaking.  

Being in business meeting is easy for me.  Or speaking at AA meeting.  It is almost second nature.

I wonder if anybody else has the same issue and specifically, struggle with one on one communication.  Dating is near impossible for me."
hspy4t,Anxiety,"When I was in a really bad moment of my life, one thing that helped me a lot (and it really did, I swear) was watching avatar, the last airbander. At first it seems like a kids show, but the massages behind it are very beautiful",
goab83,Anxiety,Slow Down. You are getting more than enough air.,"You are getting enough oxygen. Slow down your breathing. Oxygen is all around you, it is infinite, there is an abundance of it. You are in no danger of running out of it.

One of the most insidious symptoms of anxiety attacks is that you convince yourself you aren't getting enough oxygen. Then you make it true by hyperventilating.

I wanted to write this to help anyone going through what I go through on a near-daily basis, convincing myself I need more air, need to breathe harder, that I'm not getting enough oxygen.

Breathe only enough to power your body in the present moment. Don't worry if you will need more air later; you can - and will - get that later. A small breath is enough for now.

Your body is in fight or flight mode right now. It's hoarding oxygen to try and deal with imminent danger. It thinks you need a burst of energy to fight something, or sprint away. Your body is being silly, tricked by your mind. **There is no physical danger; you are safe and you know it.**

You control your body, just like you control your mind. Both of them are tools you have at your disposal. Neither controls the other, neither controls you. Right now your mind is demanding more oxygen from your body, as if it knows better. How *dare* it.

Focus on your body instead. Feel your arms, legs, your muscles. Are they running out of oxygen? No, they aren't. Right now, your heart is pounding because you are breathing too hard. There's too much oxygen, not enough carbon dioxide, you are hyperventilating and your heart is working doubletime to deal with all of that.

Your body knows exactly how much oxygen it needs. Don't be breathing until your mind tells you ""that's enough."" Breathe only until your actual body is content.

Try this if you are going through a panic attack.

On your next exhale, pause for a while before your next inhale. This will take some willpower. It will feel wrong, like you are suffocating, depriving your body of what it desperately needs. That is a lie. Do it anyways. You may start to feel a sensation in your head, almost like excess blood is draining from it. Whatever it is, don't run from it. That's the *calm* you are looking for. That's the carbon dioxide you've been depriving yourself of, and the real thing your body desperately needs.

Take in relaxed inhales. Your lungs do not need to be at full capacity. You may have to fight your mind on this. Just remember **you are getting enough air**. Your mind is being silly, you need to whip it into shape. Some things, like breathing, must be surrendered to your body. Make sure you relax when you exhale, do not contort your abs to squeeze out all the air in you.

Remember that inhaling is the only part of breathing that takes any energy. Exhaling is simply letting go."
8vtkqi,Anxiety,"Does anyone else have this thing where if strangers laugh near you, they must be laughing at you?","**EDIT:** Wow I didn't think I'd get this many comments. I'm doing my best to reply, stay strong everyone! 

I used to get bullied a lot, and it happened for many years. Kindergarten to like 10th grade, so it's kind of become ingrained in me and it's hard to completely shake it. I'm almost 25, so it feels ridiculous. 

I especially have this with groups of teenagers, I'm genuinely afraid of them lol

If I'm in a group I might not even think of it, but alone is a different story.

What's your experience been with this? Did you eventually get over it? "
chagm3,Anxiety,I finally did it!,"For lunch today I went out to my local McDonald’s, and I actually sat down and ate my food inside, without any friends or family there! 

My main thing is I hate going places alone because I feel like everyone is watching me, but when I was eating I just focused on eating and texting my friends. I’ve been meaning to apply for a job, but I don’t know if I’ll be able to walk into the store to ask about it."
avu2q6,Anxiety,I’ve applied for two jobs!!,"I just wanted to share some good news. I’ve always been terrified of getting a job, but I’m trying my best to be brave.

egkgv0,Anxiety,Going non verbal when you're upset/stressed?,"Does anyone else go nonverbal when theres too much going on and your stressed out and have major sensory overload.

I can hear every noise anyone in this house makes and I just want to punch something. When I get like this it feels physically impossible to talk and people just keep talking to you even though you clearly dont want to. this was just a little bit of a rant because I needed it, but i was wondering if anyone else goes non verbal in stressful situations."
io8bpw,Anxiety,Anyone else have chronic anxiety since childhood but never addressed it until their 30s?,I started therapy and meds in my early 20s but never really made an effort to confront my anxieties head on until I turned 30. I just assumed meds and therapy would fix everything. They helped a bit but my quality of life was still poor. I think we let these issues linger because our formative years distract us with school and work etc. it isn’t until we’re older that we can sit back and evaluate our experiences. Going forward I plan to exercise and practice self care. At least there’s no “trial and error” in that

Wooooo!"
9g1bwv,Anxiety,Is it normal to have fun while drinking then feel depressed and over-analyse everything you did when you sober up?,"Hi guys, i know alcohol is a 'depressant' but I just thought that meant you become more depressed when you drink it, not after.
Anyway, I can only really come out of my shell once I'm drunk, I'm pretty bad at introducing myself to people unless I am wasted, so alcohol is pretty essential to my way of life I suppose.
But when I finish drinking, oh boy do I worry too much. For example, last night I was drinking with my friends and everything was going brilliantly but now I'm really worried about what kinda impression I gave to some people and whether or not I said something offensive. I know I at least blew my chance to get some action last night but that's ok, there are bigger issues at hand. I also worry I bring up my issues too much and bring the whole atmosphere down. Sorry for the rant, and thanks for your time if you did choose to read through this, I hope you all lead long, fulfilling lifes.

ldqe8u,Anxiety,i managed to shower tonight,"hello, everybody!

this is my first time posting on this sub, usually i reside on the health anxiety sub, but i think my victory would be better suited here.

so with my anxiety, and the physical sensations it causes, it makes my anxiety worse and then i get stuck in a feedback loop of being anxious. that sends me into panic attacks, although my panic attacks can also just. come out of nowhere. this being said, a LOT of my panic attacks have happened in the shower, either during or after. overtime this developed into a fear of showering in general. (in case you may be wondering ""can you take a bath?"" i sadly am not able to as our house is old and does not have a bathtub installed)

i did usually take cloth baths and washed my hair in the sink, but did not dare try to actually get in the shower. 

well, tonight, with the unexpected help of my mom, i actually did it. and i felt better afterwards. better than i thought. it was hell, and i ran out at one point in a panic, but i managed to finish. 

i feel kinda like crying but im somewhat proud of myself for just. doing it, even with some help. i feel good, save for the fact that my muscles feel kinda weird and hurt a little because i was sooo tense the entire time. 

i know its pathetic to have your biggest accomplishment be the fact that you showered (trust me, im well aware) but i feel like you guys might understand. 

thanks for listening :,)"
kwhsep,Anxiety,"If you're reading this, remember that the things anxiety whispers into your mind aren't necessarily an ultimate reality.","Oftentimes, anxiety blows reality out of proportion, amplifying the threats behind otherwise mundane activities all the while convincing you that it's real. It helps to take a step back and realize that those nagging thoughts about what if this and that are fabrications suggested by the anxiety, almost like a devil on your shoulder. 

For example, instead of ""what if something bad happens"" and drifting along with the thought, step back and realize that it's just a thought ""alright, cool, that is a thought and/or feeling generated by the part of the brain responsible for anxiety"". It won't eliminate the anxiety, but it helps, and with practice along with a keen focus to catch yourself drifting (which you can also practice by focusing on something like water drops, ambiance, or your breath) you will get better at dealing with anxiety. Thank you for reading this and have a wonderful day guys!. Here's a virtual hug."
gv9rta,Anxiety,it’s okay if you need to take a break,"no matter what race you are, it’s okay to sign off for a while and look after yourself. the world is stressful and the anxiety with it is uncontrollable, but your health is the most important in times like these. stay safe <3"
ci7u59,Anxiety,Ever feel overwhelmed by the amount of evil in the world?,"I'm a bit of a history buff, and I made the mistake of watching some documentaries on the fascists of the early 20th century recently. Naturally they discussed things like the Holocaust, the Red Terror, and other atrocities of that era.  That shit really gets to me, and lately I've found myself being overly sensitive to every terrible thing on the news as a result.  A college girl goes missing, a boy is murdered by his step-dad, etc; you get the drift.  It can be a little over whelming sometimes.  I just don't understand how human beings are capable of doing such horrible things to one another.

Does anyone else struggle to process this stuff, and how do you deal with it?

**EDIT: I've been reading all of your comments for the last day, and I just wanted to thank everyone.  You tend to *assume* people feel the same way you do on common sense issues like this, but actually seeing individual responses and everyone's different ways of coping is very therapeutic.  It's nice to know I'm not alone.**"
9xcov2,Anxiety,Does anyone else get anxiety when they are waiting on someone to answer them?,"Whenever I send text messages and it takes someone an unusual amount of time to answer I find myself getting more and more anxious.

What do you guys do to calm down in a situation like and not let your mind go crazy?"

i4zxz4,Anxiety,The best part of my day is the three seconds after waking up where I don't remember what my problems are,:(
l4lsgt,Anxiety,It’s time for me to leave this sub <3,"Long time lurker here! I’ve just finished therapy and I’m officially “cured” of my anxiety! Even though it might come back some day, I now know how to handle it and get through it again and again. 

Lurking in this sub has helped me cope with a lot of my insecurities and has helped me realise that i am not alone. So thank you all for that! 

To all of you, I also want to say that there is a way out of anxiety. You can get better, no matter which road you choose to do it through and it is definitely wort it! I really hope for you all that you will keep on fighting and come through all of your struggles. No matter if you think them small or overwhelming, struggle is a struggle, so keep on fighting that devil! 

Some advise from my therapist (psychiatrist) that might help some if you (it helped me a lot!) is to realise that worrying wont solve anything. Not that you should be able to control when your brain starts to worry, but if it starts, then don’t give it as much attention (i used to worry about everything and it drained all of energy). A point my therapist also made was that if two persons got in an accident, one who worries about such accident and one who doesn’t, the one who worries won’t be any more prepared than the one who don’t worry. It’s an incident, it’s a part of life. 
Getting to accepting that fact helped me through everything. I don’t say it will help
everyone, but i hope it will help some of you <3 

Lots of love from me!

Edit: just to clarify about the term “cured”. I lacked a better word, but maybe acceptance is a better substitute? Idk, but what i mean is that my anxiety no longer is an issue that i have to use so much energy on :) I know how to deal with it and don’t feel it anymore - and if it should come back tomorrow, in a week, a month, a year, a decade, i know how to deal with it ;) And if it comes, it comes. No amount worrying can ever prepare me for it, on the contrary!  :)

Edit: It’s not time for me to leave the sub yet! I’m definitely staying! Great thanks to you all for the upvotes and rewards! 

Edit: please feel free to AMA about the process, i will try my best to answer the best i can!

Edit: typo

kez1tj,Anxiety,I finally got my driver's license!,"I'm so happy! I've been postponing driving school for years because of my anxiety but I'm so glad I had the courage to actually do this. I feared driving like I haven't feared anything before in my life. I always thought I could never learn how to drive and, even if I did, I was afraid of the worst outcomes (dying in a crash, killing someone, destroying my car, etc). I still can't know what the future has in store for me but at least I got over my crippling fear of driving. And today I finally got my driver's license! I am so happy and amazed at the same time, I just felt like sharing this in case anyone needed to hear it: you can do it. If anyone feels the same I used to feel about driving, I am the perfect example that nothing is impossible (and believe me, I used to be really, really BAD at it)."
c6nptv,Anxiety,I asked for a different lid today,"Today I went to Starbucks, ordered my drink and with little hesitation asked for one of the lids without a straw. Now to some this may seem like an everyday thing but for me this was a big step. After that I went to my first ever lash lift appointment. I was so unbelievably excited to treat myself to this. I laid down, closed my eyes and the woman began my treatment. I knew from the beginning I had to keep my eyes closed for a good hour and a half but, I had no idea how I would react. Once she had the perm solution on and she took her hands away from my eyes to let it sit it all sank in. I immediately started to feel dizzy and like I needed to open my eyes IMMEDIATELY. Now, a few years ago I would have just sat there through my anxiety attack and just dealt with it because I didn’t want to bother her. Today, I very politely explained to her that I needed to have it taken off and I would still pay her for the service. She was so kind and understanding that she didn’t charge me for anything and told me I could always come back and try again another day. Again, to some people this would sound like a failure. I failed to complete the treatment and I felt so overwhelmed, embarrassed, and upset. But, I asked for a different lid today. And that’s a win in my book."
hes27c,Anxiety,Anxiety is the most exhausting thing I’ve experienced.,"I’ve had migraines for 4, almost 5 years now. They’re exhausting since they’re everyday, I feel I’m in constant pain but it’s nothing compared to my anxiety. Even when I was on anaesthetic after surgery and I wasn’t able to move much cause of how tired I was, it’s still less exhausting than my anxiety. 

This anxiety is insane. Yeah, maybe it’s improved around my boyfriend and family. But I’m having so many bad days where I’m scared to look out my window, where I’m scared to talk to someone online, where I’m in the call with friends I’m scared to get close to because what if I breathe into the mic? Like I’m actually scared they’ll hear me breathing. What? Why? ITS STUPID. I want to just not care, to do what I want how I want not even thinking about the judgement of others, when I convince myself I’ll finally do it, it’s when I’m in bed just as I’m about to fall asleep at 5am, then I wake up the next day in the afternoon and care. It’s tiring. I’m tired of caring. Tired of thinking. Tired of feeling. Tired of the thought that this will be forever, maybe not how bad it is, yeah I’m sure I’ll get through it and it’ll get better. But this anxious feeling is forever. I hate it."

I keep feeling like I could have achieved so much till my age but I didn't and now there's no going back. 
It's like my 20s are the years I must do everything, be the best version of myself but I constantly fail to do so, because of which I am and will remain a failure.
I feel like I'm running out of time."
k2vm53,Anxiety,Finally mustered up the courage and applied to grad school!,"I graduated from undergrad about 5 years ago and never got a job in my field. I was stuck working retail and feeling pretty crappy. I did a double degree in marketing and psychology and the plan was always to get a job in marketing, get some money and go back to be a counselling psychologist. Which clearly never happened.

To make a long story short, I have lots of anxiety which has made it super difficult for me to not only apply to jobs, but to be successful in interviews. I had a really bad interview experience shortly after graduating and the interviewer made me cry during the interview and I just lost all faith in my skills and abilities.

I gave up. I would avoid looking for jobs, if I did have the courage to apply to a job, I would have anxiety about the potential interview. I would have panic attacks before the interviews. I would feel myself shaking during interviews. It was just very hard for me to get over the anxiety. I even started going to therapy again to see if that would help me.

Avoiding the job search  was hard cause everyone around me didn’t understand the damage this one interview did to me. I felt like an imposter in all my other interviews and I just never felt good enough. Good old anxiety.

Then August 2020, I decided to ask for some help from my cousin, who is almost done a masters in psychology, to help me with the application process and just to see if this would even be a viable option for me.

So we started looking. It all started to look very possible, but I required to get some references from my old professors. Thats when the anxiety started up again. Would my professors from at least 5 years ago even remember me? How do I even go about asking them? What if they say no?

I was so nervous about this and its one of the main reasons why I hadn't done all this sooner. All those what ifs. All that anxiety talk.

Two weeks ago, I finally did it. I asked 2 of my old professors. Of course they didn't reply and that had me spiral a bit. I was then encouraged by my cousin to send a follow up email. I got the first response and it was a yes! The second one, not so much. She was skeptical at first cause i was asking so close to the deadline, but she made an exception for me.

After a rollercoaster of emotions and many panic attacks later, I have applied!

I DID IT! The thing that has kept me up for so many nights, all the anxiety and what ifs, and I finally over came it all.

I feel so proud of myself, and honestly I cannot wait to tell my therapist. I finally did something that scared me, and even if it doesn't work out, at least now I can say that I tried and I gave it my all."
dl0hxl,Anxiety,New spin on anxiety: we are just superheros with an extraordinary amazingly functioning fight/flight reaction,
hf4z51,Anxiety,"DAE get ""emotional build-up"" over time because of anxiety and the only solution is to cry it out?","I've suffered from anxiety and panic attacks for 19 years now. Sometimes, it gets better, but then I'll start building up anxiety, internalizing it, and then have an emotional breakdown for months-worth of anxiety. Crying seems to be the only thing that relieves the pressure.

I know that's the concept of catharsis, and others must experience it, too. I also know that PTSD can develop due to the accumulation of stressful life experiences (as opposed to a singular traumatic event), so the same underlying concepts can probably apply here, too. 

But fuck, all I want to do is cry my eyes out without having to explain why I'm crying. 

Anyway, sorry for the rant. I'm super anxious atm.

‐----------------------------------

EDIT: I'm really glad we all kind of took the opportunity to bond over something so stressful. It makes me happy that the anxiousness I felt yesterday opened the floor for us to talk candidly about what we experience. I hope everyone feels like they're not alone. I hope we all get to feeling better, or at least discovering new, healthy ways of coping with things. ❤"
b5hwkb,Anxiety,90 days.,"Almost jumped 14 stories 90 days ago. Hungover, isolated, ashamed, totally hopeless. It was Christmas and I had zero will to live. Jumping made total rational sense. The end of all this pointless suffering. But I didn't. 

I called the hotline. I got help. I saw a psychologist. Diagnosed me with anxiety and depression. But also took a look at my self reported levels of drinking. Explained what alcohol actually does to the brain. He told me in patients with depression and anxiety who also drink, if they get sober their symptoms get easier to manage or even disappear completely.

I quit cold Turkey. My symptoms decreased 50% in frequency and 60% in severity. I'm no longer suicidal. When I get negative automatic thoughts I notice them. When I get in a thought loop I can break out.

Please, if you are suffering and drinking, give it a try. You have nothing to lose. I am going on a retreat tomorrow and I'll be on a flight for a bit, but I'll answer any questions and reply to all comments."

* Ability to make decisions - I can't even plan my day without questioning everything. Should I do something more environmentally-friendly? Should I invite a friend, and would they even say yes? Do I have chores to do instead? Do I deserve this? 
* Ability to think clearly - I feel like I live in a fog of questioning everything and feeling sad and cut-off. I don't know what is normal any more. 
* Self-confidence - I went to Paris at 18 and China aged 20 where I didn't know anyone. This weekend I haven't been to the music festival at the end of my street because I think it will stress me out too much. 
* Zest for life - I used to plan the things I wanted to do and see, and I'd go travelling at every opportunity. Now I'd be quite happy if I could just get through the week without panicking and/or hating myself.

# Anxiety tip #1 -  Stop consuming caffeine

Caffeine increases the level of a neurotransmitter called norepinephrine in your brain. This neurotransmitter triggers your sympathetic nervous system. Stimulating your fight or flight response is the primary process of the sympathetic nervous system. 

Caffeine also makes your body release adrenaline and depletes your body of the ‘anti-stress vitamin’ B1 (thiamine). For anxious people these things add up quickly, making them feel stressed out and on edge. 

Note: The sensitivity to caffeine varies quite a bit between people. But whether you are sensitive to caffeine or not, **caffeine WILL make you feel more anxious**. It’s best to avoid caffeine as much as you can. 

&#x200B;

# Anxiety tip #2 - Set specific times in your day to be offline

People with anxiety are usually sensitive and easily overstimulated. We might have gotten used to it, but the internet is a pretty hectic place. Your subconsciousness knows that at any time it could see something on the internet that will trigger it. You won't get really deep rest and stress relief if you are always online

**It’s very important that you create time for yourself every day where you KNOW that you won’t be disturbed**. Most people don’t recover well enough from their daily stress. That’s why our stress accumulates and we end up feeling anxious and on edge more than we need too. We can make sure this stops happening by planning time into our day where we’ll be offline. We should put our phone away and go read a book, meditate, or go for a walk everyday. 

&#x200B;

# Anxiety tip #3 - Train yourself to breathe through your stomach

Scientists have recently discovered that humans have group of brain cells whose only function it is to ‘watch’ our breath. If the breath is slow, deep, and done with our stomach, it signals to the brain that everything is okay. If the breath is fast, shallow, and done with our chest, it signals to the brain that something might be off.

Breathing in your chest is meant for fight or flight situations. It’s original purpose is to get your body and your mind in a state of readiness by pumping a ton of oxygen into them. 

**Breathing through your stomach has been proven to lower stress and anxiety**. And it’s actually not that hard to retrain yourself to breath like this all the time! If you learn to breathe through your stomach, you will be decreasing your anxiety automatically, just by breathing. 

&#x200B;

# Anxiety tip #4 - Tie up loose ends

You could do this right now, and it would make a world of difference. We can feel very overwhelmed and anxious because we have so many loose ends in our life. We have mail that we haven’t opened yet, we have friends we should call, maybe our room needs a good cleaning, or you haven’t checked your bank statements in 2 months. 

These things are tricky to actually go and do. The longer we procrastinate, the more anxiety we build up around them. But biting the bullet and doing all these things will reduce your anxiety a lot. It might spike your anxiety while you’re doing it. But when it’s done you’ll feel much better and lighter. **The less we have on our mind, the less anxious we’ll feel.** 

&#x200B;

# Anxiety tip #5 - Exercise at least twice a week

Now most of us know that exercise is healthy and works well to reduce anxiety. But a lot of us don’t realise just how critical exercise is. In his ‘*Anxiety and Phobia workbook*’  E.J. Bourne says **his clients reported exercise to be the most effective thing for reducing their anxiety.** 

Exercise is a natural outlet for the body's fight or flight mode. There are many proven benefits to regular exercise. Among them are reduced insomnia, increased self-esteem, and greater sense of control over anxiety. 

Pro Tip: Exercise that targets your larger muscles, like running, swimming, and cycling, are found to be the most effective for countering anxiety

&#x200B;

# Anxiety tip #6 - Be in flow

Athletes call this state ‘being in the zone’, Psychologists refer to it as flow. It’s a state where you forget the time and whatever is going on around you. If you are in flow you are totally absorbed in what you are doing. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, the psychologist who came up with the concept, describes the 8 characteristics of flow as follows:

1. Complete **concentration** on the task
2. **Clarity of goals** and reward in mind and immediate feedback
3. Transformation of **time** (speeding up/slowing down of time)
4. The experience is intrinsically **rewarding**
5. **Effortlessness** and ease
6. There is a balance between **challenge and skills**
7. Actions and awareness are merged, **losing self-conscious rumination**
8. There is a feeling of **control** over the task

Flow makes you temporarily free from your anxiety in a healthy way. It makes you more calm throughout your day and gives you something to look forward too. Find something that puts you in a state of flow and make sure you do it at least once or twice a week. It will make a big difference in in your life satisfaction.

# Anxiety tip #7 - create an anxiety busting morning ritual

Most people grab their phone the second they wake up. This is about worst thing you can do to start your day. It’s very important we start our day on our own terms. We should let no influence from the outside bother us for at least the first hour of your day. Create a morning ritual for yourself that calms you and will give you the necessary strength to deal with your anxiety. 

We shouldn’t sleep on creating a morning ritual! It makes a massive difference if you start your day right. 

Those are my 7 tips for reducing your anxiety right now, so you can be more peaceful and more successful in your relationships, job, and your life.

However, my boss has been amazing about this. He's been totally good with the appointments, checking up on me when I've had to see specialists and had to change meds. He see's me not only as an employee, but as a person that is trying their best and stuff is just going down.

g14yme,Anxiety,I’m crying because the pharmacist treated me like a drug addict,"(UPDATED!)Today l went to the pharmacist to get my prescription of 7 pieces 0.5 mg xanax that my psychiatrist gave me for my generalized anxiety disorder carrying my passport like they asked of me and because in my country people my age don’t have any other id (15) and she refused to give it to me saying she needed an id card and people go around asking for this stuff so l told her l don’t have an ld card and to give me my other prescription of Cipralex and she refused and left the window. It scarred me and l’m scared to ask for my prescription of xanax in any other pharmacy.

Update: l’m so happy right now! I went to the pharmacy again today with my older sister to see what was the problem and there was another pharmacist working there and he was super polite and said again that they accept only an id card and made a phone call for us and recommended another pharmacy chain we could go to who will accept a passport, so we went to the pharmacy and they were super nice also and gave me the meds with no problem.

k1n0qs,Anxiety,Does anyone ever feel like they are in a constant state of mild dizziness,I can feel dizzy when walking around my house without feeling anxious. I have had anxiety and dizziness at the same time but when I’m dizzy and not anxious it scares me. I have thought maybe I’m anxious without knowing and that’s why I’m dizzy. Or maybe it’s because I have had high anxiety for almost a year and this is the after effects. I don’t really have health issues and my doctor doesn’t really think it’s necessary to do an mri on my brain because it’s very unlikely I have an issue in my brain.
havtlx,Anxiety,Small personal win: I went into a store today!,I’ve been doing delivery and car side pickup since March and haven’t stepped foot inside a store—I’ve been too nervous to go in anywhere. This morning I decided I would finally try going to Target to get a few things. I’ve been really worried about feeling like I can’t breath with a mask on and having a panic attack in the store but it ended up being ok :) It was early enough that there were barely any other people there so it was actually kind of nice to be back doing something regular. AND they had Clorox wipes in stock!

78pd7o,Anxiety,"Is anyone else introverted most of the time, but very extroverted in friend groups or people you're fairly close with?","When I have to be in uncomfortable social interactions (large meetings at work, networking &amp;amp; meeting with possible clients at dinners, etc.) carrying on normal conversation and staying ""in the pocket"" is extremely draining.

However, in my groups of friends and acquaintances, I'm one of the most talkative, outgoing, and funny people (my opinion) in the group and it makes me feel genuinely happy.

What does this mean? I understand that the whole concept of introvert vs extrovert isn't black and white, but what can I learn from this? 

Edit: thanks for the responses. A lot of people are saying things like ""well yeah that just sounds like social anxiety"", or ""you're more comfortable around your friends so obviously you'll be more yourself"" but that's not what I'm getting at. I don't just become a ""normal"" member of the conversation when I'm comfortable - rather I tend to dominate it. I enjoy it a *lot*. So I'm wondering if the repressing of my own thoughts and words in uncomfortable situations is sort of causing this buildup of social energy which then gets released when I'm comfortable."

gbcpep,Anxiety,I always feel bad about conversations after the fact,"I feel that I can have conversations with people just fine but afterwards I always regret the way they go. Today I ran into a friend and we chatted for 15 minutes or so and I thought our talk went great (she seemed to be happy with my presence and the conversation flowed well) until after the fact. Now I have intrusive thoughts like “I should have asked her more about herself instead of talking about me the entire time”, “I should have said this but I didn't”, “Did I say anything that upset her?” and “Was my body language off-putting?” Worries like these keep me up at night because I don’t know if these thoughts are the truth or just fabrications from my overthinking. Because of these worries I constantly imagine how my conversations could have gone better. I just wish I could know how people truly think of me because I feel like people put on a fake smile when I’m talking to them when in reality I bore them, annoy them or weird them out."
eq8lgh,Anxiety,I'm really tired of people just telling me to stop worrying or fearing things,"You think I choose to feel this way? ""Just don't worry about it"" wow thanks, clearly my subconscious just needed a reminder not to worry. Amazing advice, thanks.


I have some really bad fears that I can't get over and I am just at my breaking point. I don't know what to do anymore"
lmxt4b,Anxiety,Dies anyone else get anxious just sending a text?,"Idk why but when I just sent my friend a text I got extremely anxious do so. Took me ten min just to send it, seem relevant and concise. Then I over analysed it after I sent it, read it a million times and panic if they don't respond ugh 

Comments are the worst 😂

****Update**** 

Thank you all for opening the dialog. It's been nice sharing stories and experiences with details on how you felt, grew, and approached then. I thoroughly have enjoyed all these conversations. Appreciate you all , thank you 🙏"
hxnlc5,Anxiety,Does anyone else get feel their anxiety makes them impatient with the urge for things/events to happen asap than later?,"I feel my anxiety makes me VERY impatient and restless until whatever is planned or needed to be done happens and is over with.

For example, if my doctors appointment gets booked for a week after, I get impatient with it with the feeling of getting it over with. Until the appointment is over my head is consumed with anxious thoughts about the doctors appointment. I.e scripting out what I will say to the doctor, thinking about what will happen if my symptoms go away, thinking about what will happen if they get worse or making scenarios of what the doctor might say.

Also, ""things to do"" lists stress me out because I feel the need to get everything done at once or I will feel overwhelmed.

The time between ""now"" and ""that"" become such a stressful period."
f3foai,Anxiety,Anxiety about making noise,"Does anyone else have such anxiety about being loud and making noise? You don’t want to annoy anyone or draw attention to yourself. Making popcorn makes me extremely anxious because it’s me making so much noise. I can’t play the TV or video games loudly out of fear someone will hear. And sexual or romantic activity is the worst noise anxiety. Does anyone else experience this? If so, do you have any advice?"
6cue66,Anxiety,Hey. Hey you. *gives Internet hug* It's going to be ok,"Sometimes all I want is someone to hug me and tell me it's going to be ok. What's frustrating is that if I tell people this I feel like they'll just be doing because I told them I like it, and not because they actually care or because they actually think I'll be ok. 


Ive been lurking a while here and as shitty as it sounds its weirdly comforting to know I'm not alone, so thank you.

Sorry the body of this post isn't as happy as the title."
dup9x7,Anxiety,Anxiety has completely and utterly destroyed the person I was before.,"Id give almost anything to get my life before back.. :(

Edit: Really didn't think this would get so big. I really appreciate all the love and all of the people reaching out to me. I'm slowly reading through all your comments. Thank you."
eiyb5d,Anxiety,Shotout to those heading back to work today after a break,"I know it’s really hard for me, especially being seen/talking to coworkers after a long break, feeling like they’re judging me. Whatever triggers your anxiety at work if you’re heading back in today, my thoughts are with you."
d6l9yw,Anxiety,Anybody else feel like they are addicted to rewatching old comedies because the familiarity of it soothes their anxiety?,"I definitely feel like rewatching episodes of Brooklyn Nine-Nine and The Office soothe my anxiety. And I definitely feel like I use these shoes as a way of distracting myself from the anxiety. I feel it’s because the shows are so familiar to me, and I love the characters so much that they comfort me. 

I even went through a stage where I would finish B99 and then just click right back onto episode one. 

Can anyone explain why I might do this? Does anyone else do the same?"
