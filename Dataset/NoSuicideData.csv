ha4t7t,movies,"Adam Sandler said he would make a terrible film if he didn't win a Best Actor Academy Award for Uncut Gems. To help him out, I analyzed his films and their movie posters to come up with a perfectly bad Sandler film entitled 'Jacked Up'","Earlier in the year, Adam Sandler was a guest on Howard Stern’s show to discuss his starring role in the excellent *Uncut Gems*. During the interview, Sandler made a joke about what would happen if he didn’t win the Best Actor Academy Award. [He told Howard](https://www.businessinsider.com/adam-sandler-threatened-to-make-bad-movie-if-he-doesnt-win-oscar-uncut-gems-2019-12):

“If I don’t get it, I’m going to f–king come back and do one again that is so bad on purpose just to make you all pay. That’s how I get them.”

In a bad news, bad news situation, Sandler wasn’t nominated, and he’s promised to make a terrible film (I’ll still watch it a few times regardless). In an effort to assist the Sandman with his terrible film, I dug through all of his films and analyzed their posters to come up with the objectively worst Sandler picture that could be made. Here it is:

* *Jacked Up*
* Directed by Dennis Dugan
* Written By - Tim Herlihy
* PG-13
* Running Time: 135 minutes
* Released on Netflix
* Predicted Tomatometer score - 6%
* Predicted IMDb score - 3.75

Adam Sandler plays a personal trainer/shoe salesman named Jack Goodheart who is married to Janet Goodheart (Also, Sandler, using a very off-putting voice). They travel to an exclusive resort in Costa Rica to attend his 30th high school anniversary during the fourth of July weekend. During the event, Rob Schneider (playing a terrorist) and his team of henchmen, hijack the event and take everyone hostage, including State Senator Chuck Finley (Terry Crews) and presidential candidate Casey Fitzpatrick (Maya Rudolph). During the melee, Jack and Janet escape, and the two use their past military experience and buff physiques to save the day. This PG-13 action-comedy is entitled “*Jacked Up*” and ends with a jet ski chase at the hotel’s lazy river pool that circles the hotel. The film is directed by Dennis Dugan, and co-stars Kevin James, Chris Rock, David Spade, Salma Hayek, Terry Crews, Steve Buscemi, Taylor Lautner, Luke Wilson, Peter Dinklage, Maya Rudolph, and Al Pacino.

This is how I came up with the storyline. I pulled together his best and worst films to find patterns that appear. Here are Sandler's lowest rated films on Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb. I drew a lot of inspiration from them. Also, I tried to make this as objective as possible.

* *The Ridiculous 6  (0% TM)* \- Action Comedy  - Action hero
* *Jack and Jill (3% - 3.3 IMDb)* \- Two Sandler's - Jet Ski scene - Married - Holiday
* *Grown Ups 2* (7%) - Reunited with old friends - Married
* *Bulletproof* (8%) - Action comedy
* *The Cobbler* (9%) - Shoe repairman
* *The Do-Over (10%)*  \- Action Comedy - Reunited with old friend - Married
* *Grown Ups (10%)* \- Reunited with old friends - Holiday - Married
* *Adam Sandler’s Eight Crazy Nights (12%)*\- Takes place during a holiday
* *Blended* (14%) - He’s a dad who travels to Africa
* *Going Overboard* (1.8 IMDb) - Lots of terrible boat action
* *The Week Of* (5.1 IMDb) families get together for a wedding
* *Sandy Wexler (5.1 IMDb)* \- Sandler pulls a unique voice (which isn’t statistically a good thing

**Here’s all I research I compiled to create** ***Jacked Up***

* A trademark of Sandler’s latest movies is that he likes to travel to beautiful locations to film (which is brilliant, and why not?). *The Do-Over, Just Go With It, Blended*, *Grown Ups 1 & 2* and *Murder Mystery* are examples of his penchant for travel. The problem is, the films have a lower Tomatometer average (21.2%) than the films where he didn’t travel to nice locations (37.4%). This is why he travels in *Jacked Up*.
* Sandler has several directors that he enjoys working with. Those Directors are Steven Brill, Dennis Dugan and Frank Coraci. Steven Brill (20%) has a lower Tomatometer average than Dennis Dugan (24%) and Frank Coraci (30%). However, Dugan is responsible for *Jack & Jill*, so I’m giving him the director’s chair. He did direct *Happy Gilmore*, so this could backfire on me. Frank Coraci directed *The Ridiculous 6*, but, [I love the baseball scene ](https://youtu.be/sI6LvdaozEk)and he also directed *The Waterboy* and *The Wedding Singer.*
* Aside from *You Don’t Mess With the Zohan* ([which is brilliant, and has a fun jet ski action scene](https://youtu.be/5OfAMHeIr7k)), His action comedies are lackluster. *Bulletproof* (8%) and *The Do-Over (9%)* didn’t win him many points. That’s why *Jacked Up* features an action-centered plot.
* His films featuring him as a married man have a 29% Tomatometer average. Movies featuring him as a single man have a 38% Average. Thus, the marriage to himself (think *Jack & Jill*) is included. It’s a double whammy
* I picked Tim Herlihy to write because he wrote *The Ridiculous Six, Grown Ups 2* and *Pixels (8% average)*. I do love his *Happy Gilmore, Billy Madison, The Wedding Singer* and *The Waterboy* scripts though
* His PG-13 (29%) rated films have a lower Tomatometer average than his R (51%) and PG-rated (45%) films. For Netflix, M rating = R and TV-14 = PG-13
* I included a pool because in [*Airheads* he is a pool cleaner who thinks about swimming pools](https://youtu.be/YryTJKsn2i0). Also, *Grown Ups, The Do-Over, Jack and Jill* feature swimming pools. They have low scores.
* Movies that feature Sandler doing a voice have a lower Tomatometer score (24.8%) than his regular voiced roles (36%).
* None of his Fresh films feature a jet ski -[ *50 first Dates*](https://youtu.be/S__SZwFn0Rw) *(45%),* [*Jack & Jill*](https://youtu.be/leAGt-vpIf0) *(3%)* and *You Don’t Mess with the Zohan (37%)* are all Rotten
* In *The Ridiculous Six, Grown Ups, The Do-Over*, and *Bulletproof* he plays a totally capable man who isn’t an underdog like he is in *Billy Madison* and *Happy Gilmore*. So, he can’t be a doofus during the action scenes.
* Randomly enough, Rob Schneider shouldn’t adopt some kind of stereotyped character because his makeup-less roles have a lower Tomatometer average (27.6%) than his stereotyped roles (32%).
* His lowest rated movies on IMDb are *Going Overboard* (1.5), *Jack & Jill* (3.3), *The Ridiculous 6* (4.8), *Sandy Wexler* (5.1) and *The Week Of* (5.1) - These movies feature water exploits, gun fights, weird voices, two Sandlers, and large gatherings. These things are all in *Jacked Up*.
* \*Bulletproof (\*$25 million), *Little Nicky* ($39 million) and *Blended* ($46 million) are a few of his lowest grossing comedies. In these films, he uses a wild voice, goes on vacations and engages in action shenanigans. I left out movies like *Spanglish* and *Reign Over Me* because they aren’t traditional Sandler comedies. Also, *Billy Madison* and *Happy Gilmore* weren’t huge earners. However, they established him as a force of nature.
* His first or last name couldn’t begin with an “R” -  Howard Ratner (*Uncut Gems*), Henry Roth (*50 First Dates*), Robbie Hart (*The Wedding Singer*).

**WHAT DOES THE POSTER NEED TO LOOK LIKE?**

* He cannot be centered on the poster. His best films *Punch Drunk Love, Happy Gilmore, Funny People* and *Uncut Gems* feature him centered on the poster. *The Wedding Singer, Reign Over Me* and *The Meyerowitz Stories* don’t have him centered. However, the movie posters that have centered have a 48% Tomatometer Average. The Posters that have him on the left have a 30% Tomatometer average. I’m going with that.

https://preview.redd.it/actfhq081a551.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9c8031c0894460b3d33ee218f96d31e80abcd3df

He' rarely centered in his ""worst"" films

https://preview.redd.it/7592qqi41a551.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ff647a066806a5dfbf516fd83ebff761d79621dc

* There needs to be multiple people on the poster. When Sandler is alone on a poster, his movies have a 42% Tomatometer average. The movie posters with 4+ people have a 20% Tomatometer average. More is good.
* In this poster he needs to be holding something random. In *The Cobbler* poster he is holding a coffee cup (this is important) and the movie has an 8% Tomatometer score. In *The Wedding Singer* (microphone) and *Happy Gilmore* (golf club) and *The Waterboy* (bucket, helmet) he is holding items related to his character. He needs to be holding something weird (like a can of sponsored coca-cola). Also, the posters that feature him holding an item (31%) have a lower Tomatometer score than the posters featuring him not holding anything (42%).

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/l6mzirud1a551.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d8ccf8ee14641d421c38e2c0775f00299e517d83

* It’s best if his entire body is on the poster. The movie posters featuring a full-bodied Adam Sandler have a lower Tomatometer average (31%) than his partial body posters (43%).
* Ideally, the title would be in the center, because *Jack & Jill* and *The Ridiculous Six* have somewhat centered titles.

**Poster**

* Title centered
* Sandler(s) on left side - Full body
* At least six other characters on the poster

There you have it! I can't wait to watch *Jacked Up*.

I cant think of what would have been enhanced if watched in 3D. those movies look beautiful and perfect in 2D.
those are two huge action movies and they are both being praised. Also they will both make alot of Money ( i hope so ) So my hope is, this starts a trend.

EDIT: since a lot of people are telling me ""just watch it in 2D then, no one is forcing you"" I live in germany and the theatre that I go to ( which i own a membercard to ) has all the showings in 3D until 2-3 weeks after the movie came out. maybe it will have a 2D showing once per day, but that will be like at noon on a monday or something.

azonzz,movies,"[OPINION] Rich filmmakers who probably haven't paid money to go see a film in a regular modern cinema in years/decades need to stop running their mouths about ""the sanctity of the movie theater experience"" and admonishing home viewing, which is often a far purer film experience these days.","Rant forthcoming...  


No shortage of recent examples, the most prominent obviously being Spielberg's alleged attempts to get made-for-streaming films banned from the Oscars.  


To be clear right off the bat - **I love the cinema experience**. Or rather, the *ideal* cinema experience. But that's become *so rare* as to be a complete gamble these days, and very often ends up being the *shitty* cinema experience. Whereas I can watch a movie at home and *know* it's not going to get diminished or outright ruined by any number of constant social or technical problems.  


Do any of the free premieres and private screenings Spielberg attends include people browsing Instagram on their blinding white phones every 20 minutes, or unchecked kids talking or crying? Has he dealt with people constantly getting up and walking through your FOV to go to the bathroom or get snacks at *inexplicable* times during a film, breaking your immersion? Or not being able to afford to see more than one film every month or two due to increasingly ridiculous costs?  


There's also the technical issues which have become outright depressing now. 3D looks *terrible* compared to Blu-Ray - dark, blurry, thoroughly diluting of anything the cinematographer was trying to accomplish - but is often the only option available to see something depending on where you live. There are films I don't even feel like I've *seen* until watching them properly at home, because the 3D muddled things so badly. Sound has also become an issue - contrary to the idea that a home audio setup can never compete with the cinema, I've found that theater sound is absolutely pathetic these days compared to watching Netflix with a good pair of headphones, and am often straining to hear dialogue and am utterly unmoved by the weak music. The only consistent exception there is IMAX and UltraAVX which is gloriously loud, but that can be a problem too if it's, for example, a Nolan film, who for all his big talk about the theater experience is one of of the worst offenders for ruining it with his infamously shrill mixing that leaves viewers covering their ears, only able to enjoy his work in a controlled environment months later at home.  


The ""movie theater experience"" is great when it's the good version - nobody on their phones, nobody misbehaving, perfect picture and audio, within your budget, a whole audience communally having a great time being immersed in a film together. In practice however, this perfect storm of awesome happens maybe one in five times by my reckoning these days, and more often than not it's way more immersive, impressive and pure to watch a film on an HD screen with headphones, no distractions and privacy at home. So the Hollywood elite needs a reality check about the evils of watching their films on the small screen - it's often the only way to really appreciate them now."

a68vzl,movies,"If Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence in Passengers had switched roles with Dane DeHaan and Cara Delevingne in Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets, both movies would've been significantly better.","In Valerian you could have Chris Pratt as the handsome and cocky Special Operative with his sexy, ass-kicking co-pilot in Lawrence.  They both already have a ton of charisma and chemistry and are much better suited to the athletic and action heavy roles of Valerian and Laureline and would do a far better job delivering on the action and cheesy one-liners with Pratt hitting on Lawrence and her playing hard to get.   It would be far more entertaining to see them flying around the universe than what we got in DeHaan pretending to be a character he isn't suited for and having zero chemistry with Laureline.   
  
On the other hand, you could have DeHaan in Passengers as the creepy loner and sole awakened passenger.  Slinking around the ship by himself, slowly succumbing to the isolation and going insane until he awakens Delevingne and awkwardly convinces her to fall in love with him.    
  
I think this works better because it always bugged me in Passengers that Pratt and Lawrence just so happen to be the most attractive people and have this amazingly natural on-screen chemistry right off the bat?  It would be far more interesting to have DeHaan chasing after a hesitant Delevingne and I think having him in that role being creepy and doing generally morally questionable things is much more compelling.     
  
I also think in this case, Passengers could fully commit to being more of a sci-fi horror/thriller that it wanted to be (okay, that **I** wanted it to be).  Instead of having him make the cliche third act sacrifice and then they fall in love, set up something much darker:     
  
Keep it mostly the same through the first two acts.  Jim (DeHaan) wakes up, alone and wanders around the ship for a year, with no one to talk to but the robot bartender and slowly goes insane.  Delevigne is woken up and is quietly and reluctantly falling in love with the only other person on board the ship.  She eventually realizes that her waking up wasn't an accident and that she is being gaslighted.  Naturally, she is horrified and runs off to another section of the ship and in a third act twist, discovers that she was actually not the first person DeHaan had tried this on.  That he had actually been awake much longer than he initially told her and failed several times before with other women whom he had to kill and seal off in another section of the ship.  You could even make it so the robot bartender is encouraging Jim's psychosis.  "

cahtb1,movies,"Opinion: I think it was foolish of Disney to remake so many of their popular movies within the span of a year: Dumbo, Aladdin, Lion King, Mulan. If they had spaced them out to maybe 1 or 2 a year, they might each be received better; but now people are getting weary, and Disney's greed is showing.","I know their executives are under pressure to perform, but that's the problem when capitalism overrides common sense in entertainment; they want to make the most money for the quarterly/yearly record-books and don't always consider the long-term.  IMO each of the films in the Disney Renaissance years could have pulled them a lot of money if they had released them over the course of a few years.  Those are some of their most popular properties.  But with them coming out so soon, one after the other, the public probably doesn't respect them as much nor would they be as anticipated as they could be.   At least Marvel knows how to play the 'peaks and valleys'/ cyclical nature of public interest, and so they wisely space out many of their films.  But if Disney forces its supply on movie goers, they might just find people balking at its oversaturation of the market and so may rebel in their entertainment choices some way, reflecting in lower revenue for Disney.  As it's said in Spiderman, ""with great power comes great responsibility;"" the Mouse is slowly dominating the entertainment sphere but if it can't let people step back and breathe, or delivers cookie-cutter films (which is a downside of tapping into franchise-building or nostalgia trends), the cheese pile it hoards will start to smell and it may not be able to easily escape it."

45sul3,movies,"Okay Hollywood, ""Deadpool"" and ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" are both smash hits at the box office. ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is even nominated for best picture. So, can we PLEASE go back to having R rated blockbusters?","I think /r/movies can be a bit too obsessed with things being rated R but overall, I still agree with the sentiment. Terminator 2 could not be made today and I think that's very sad because many people consider it one of the best movies of all time. 

The common counter-argument to this is something along the lines of ""swearing, blood, and nudity aren't what makes a movie good"". And that would be correct, something being rated R does not inherently make it good or better. But what it DOES add is realism. REAL people swear. Real people bleed. Real people have nipples. R ratings are better for making things feel realistic and grounded. 

Also, and I think this is an even important point, PG-13 often makes the audience feel a bit too comfortable. Sometimes art should be boundary pushing or disturbing. Some movies need to be graphic in order to really leave a lasting mark. I think this is the main problem with audiences and movies today, a lot of it is too safe and comfortable. I rarely feel any great sense of emotion. Do you think the T-1000 would have been as iconic of a movie villain if we hadn't seen him stab people through the head with his finger? Probably not. In Robocop, would Murphy's near-death experience have felt as intense had it cut away and not shown him getting filled with lead? Definitely not. Sometimes you NEED that.

I'm not saying everything has to be R. James Bond doesn't have to be R because since day one his movies were meant to be family entertainment and were always PG. Same with Jurassic Park. But the problem is that PG-13 has been used for movies that WEREN'T supposed to be like this. Terminator was never a family movie. Neither was Robocop. They were always dark, intense sci-fi that people loved because it was hardcore and badass. And look what happened to their PG-13 reboots, they were neither hardcore nor badass. 

The most common justification for things not being R is ""they make less money"" but I think this has become a self fulfilling prophecy. Studios assume they'll make less money, so they make less R rated movies, so they're less likely to make money, so then studios make less, and on and on. 

But adjusted for inflation, [Terminator 2 made almost a BILLION dollars.](http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl?cost1=520.000%2C000&year1=1991&year2=2015) (the calculator only goes up to 10,000,000 so I had to knock off some zeroes).  

[The Matrix Reloaded made even more.](http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl?cost1=742.1&year1=2003&year2=2015) 

If it's part of a franchise we like, people will probably see it anyway. It might lose a slight margin but clearly it's possible to still become a huge hit and have an R rating. 

Hell, even if it's something we DON'T know about, it can still make money. Nobody cared about the comic that Kingsman was based on but it made a lot of cash anyway. Just imagine if it had actually been part of a previously established franchise, it could have even made more of a killing. In fact, I bet the next one does even better. 

And Deadpool, who does have a fanbase, is in no way a mainstream hero and was a big gamble. But it's crushing records right now and grossed almost THREE TIMES its meager budget in just a few days. And the only reason it got made to begin with is because of Ryan Reynolds pushing for it and fans demanding it. How many more of these movies could have been made in the past but weren't because of studios not taking risks? Well, THIS risk payed off extremely well. I know Ryan wasn't the only one to make it happen, and I really appreciate whomever made the film a reality, not because it's the best movie ever (it is good though), but because it could represent Hollywood funding more of these kinds of movies. 

Sorry for the rant, but I really hope these movies are indicative of Hollywood returning to form and taking more risks again. This may be linked to /r/moviescirclejerk, but I don't care, I think it needed to be said. 

EDIT: Holy shit, did you people read anything other than the title? I addressed the majority of the points being made here. "

Some of the companies in India have already started following Disney's lead and putting new movies out of subscription for $35 to $40 rent. This was really scummy from Disney when they increased the subscription price by 50% here when lockdown started. I wouldn't mind paying a little bit extra as a part of annual subscription to offset for new movies but selling them out of subscription is bad for consumers and with a big company like Disney leading the charge,  most of the local smaller companies will follow.
How is it in your respective countries? Have your local language streaming platforms started doing something similar?"

eh71gy,movies,I saw 192 movies in theaters in 2019. Here is my full ranking.,"This year I went to see 192 different movies in theaters, plus one rewatch. That's up from 162 in 2018, 140 in 2017, 9 in 2016, and 5 in 2015. I usually go 3 or 4 times per week, mostly on weekends. I keep track of dates/theaters/movies/ratings for fun and save all of the stubs.

My ratings are what I give the movie right after seeing it, with no real 'checklist' or anything, mostly just initial thought/enjoyment/opinion. It's not meant to be taken super seriously, I'm not a professional reviewer.

This is my full ranking for the year, from favorite to least-favorite, with a few small reviews/thoughts thrown in:

--------------------------------------------------------

**Monos - 10/10** - *Hands-down my favorite movie of the year and honestly high on my all-time list. It's Apocalypse Now meets Lord of the Flies, with some Beasts of No Nation thrown in. It builds a unique, lived-in world that's believable and brutal. Beautifully-filmed, some of the best shots of the year (the ending shot gets seared in your mind). Modern and grounded look at a militia/cartel fighting against an unnamed enemy in a Colombian jungle. It almost feels post-apocalyptic instead of 'cartel vs government', which I really loved. You get to imagine your own backstory as the story unfolds. Unforgiving and gut-wrenching, but hopeful too. Got a lot out of its cast. Can't recommend this movie enough. Really disappointed this didn't make the Best Foreign Language Film shortlist. ""Masterpiece"" gets thrown around a lot, but in my mind this is the only one this year.*

**Marriage Story - 10/10**

**The Farewell - 10/10**

**Journey to a Mother's Room - 9/10** - *Biggest surprise of the year, came out of nowhere. Deeply-personal story between a mother & daughter. It's very basic on the surface, and there's not much story (you start at Point A, and end at Point A), but it's the most emotional movie of the year. If you don't cry at least 3 times during this, you're probably not human. It's all about the unbreakable connection you have to your parent(s), from the day you're born until the day you die. It only takes place over the course of a few months, but feels like lifetimes. Beautiful little movie about separation, loss, and human connection.*

**Waves - 9/10** - *I could write 20 pages on how much I loved this movie. To keep it short, it's got a perfect soundtrack, perfect setting, awards-worthy performances (from Kelvin Harrison Jr., Sterling K. Brown, and Taylor Russell). Visceral story that grips you from the first minute and doesn't let go until the closing shot. Unique use of colors and aspect-ratio. It takes a huge risk structurally that pays off. It's also the only movie I went to see twice this year. Really worth it too, picked up on a lot of stuff on the second viewing. Would've went a third time if theaters kept it playing longer. Every tiny decision/action has a huge impact. Just watch this.*

**Last Black Man In San Francisco - 9/10**

**Birds of Passage - 9/10**

**Apollo 11 - 9/10** - *The best documentary of the year. Probably the best editing (and use of sound) I've ever seen/heard in a documentary. It's unique because they don't use interviews like most documentaries do, it's real sound the whole through. Impressive use of archival footage/audio.*

**Uncut Gems - 9/10** - *This movie wasn't on the Best Original Score shortlist for the 2020 Oscars. This aggression will not stand.*

**The Mustang - 9/10**

**Wild Rose - 9/10** - *If this doesn't win the Oscar for Best Original Song ('Glasgow'), I've lost all faith in the Academy. The ending concert scene had me crying like a baby. Jessie Buckley is gonna be big. Best music-drama since A Star Is Born.*

**Transit  - 9/10**

**Ad Astra - 9/10** - *Top-notch acting, great atmosphere, world-building, existentialism, beautiful VFX, engaging score. Best opening scene of the year. Thoughtful commentary on modern society all wrapped in a Heart of Darkness blanket. If you're into space/exploration movies, then I recommend this. Surprised at the backlash this movie has gotten on /r/movies.*

**The Report  - 9/10** - *This was a really good year for legal-thrillers and The Report was the cream of the crop. Tight, Sorkin-like script with top performances from Adam Driver & Annette Bening. Could change a lot of minds about the war on terror and use of torture.*

**Parasite - 9/10**

**Once Upon A Time In Hollywood - 9/10**

**Midnight Traveler - 9/10** - *If you feel like life is unfair and the odds are stacked against you, watch this movie. It puts everything in a different perspective. Every problem you have is going to seem minuscule compared to what this family went through. It's eye-opening and should fill you with anger.*

**Luce - 9/10** - *It's Kelvin Harrison Jr's world and we're just living in it.*

**The Irishman - 8/10**

**Mickey and the Bear - 8/10** - *Camila Morrone puts in the best breakout performance of the year. PTSD, drug-addiction, alcoholism, rural Montana, toxic relationships, James Badge Dale, following your dreams. What's not to love?*

**The Art of Self Defense - 8/10** - *The best dark-comedy of the year. So many great one liners. It's like Yorgos Lanthimos directing Death of Stalin, set in a karate studio. Surprisingly violent and depressing, but in all the right ways. Jesse Eisenberg's best movie since.....The Social Network?*

**Peanut Butter Falcon - 8/10** - *""Am I going to die?"" ""We all do, it's only a 
matter of time, now stop being a little bitch."" - Favorite line of the year, really stuck with me.*

**Everybody Knows - 8/10**

**Mary Magdalene - 8/10**

**Knives Out - 8/10** - *Well-crafted whoddunit with an ensemble cast. Just a genuinely fun time at the movies. Ana de Armas with well-deserved leading role for once. A few of the characters are a tad bit unrealistic (and basically caricatures), but the movie doesn't take itself seriously enough for that to be a problem. Daniel Craig hamming it up with a Southern accent was fun. Old school film with a modern twist.*

**The Lighthouse - 8/10** 

**The Dead Don't Die - 8/10** - *This movie really isn't for everyone, but I loved the dry humor and purposefully-bad chemistry/dialogue. The line delivery was off-putting but hilarious. Everything is extremely on-the-nose and it works. I could watch 10 hours of Tom Waits talking to himself.*

**Us - 8/10**

**Villains - 8/10**

**Ford v Ferrari  - 8/10** 

**Midsommar - 8/10**

**Jojo Rabbit  - 8/10** 

**Official Secrets - 8/10** - *Keira Knightley with one of the most underrated performances of the year. Another really good legal/political-thriller that exposes the dark side of government bureaucracy.*

**Pain & Glory - 8/10** 

**John Wick 3: Parabellum - 8/10**

**Queen & Slim - 8/10**

**Amazing Grace - 8/10** - *Great concert-documentary. Some of Aretha Franklin's performances in this should give you insane chills. I actually had this one rated higher right after watching it, but then looked up some of the people shown on screen and it turns out some were real pieces of shit, while preaching to people like hypocrits. Felt gross and took a lot of the magic out. One of my few revised scores this year.*

**A Beautiful Day In The Neighborhood - 8/10**

**Joker - 8/10**

**Non-Fiction - 8/10** - *It's very French (talky and sexual) and the writing seems impressed with itself,  but it's a good adult-drama that surprised me. I'm a big fan of Olivier Assayas and this is some of his best work.*

**Rocketman - 8/10**

**Stan & Ollie - 8/10**

**Hustlers - 8/10**

**Avengers Endgame - 8/10**

**Doctor Sleep - 8/10** - *It gets bloated and probably needed to be 20-30 minutes shorter (there's a shit ton of side-characters), but it was a worthwhile sequel to The Shining. Didn't feel like a cash grab and carries its own weight.*

**Booksmart - 8/10** 

**Little Monsters  - 8/10** - *I'd recommend watching this based just on Josh Gad's character. So over-the-top and hilarious. When he starts chugging hand sanitizer might be the most I laughed in a theater this year. Also Lupita Nyong'o playing & singing on the ukulele to a bunch of kids is exactly what I needed in my life. Cute zombie-comedy with a ton of heart.*

**Spider-Man: Far From Home - 8/10**

**A Hidden Life - 8/10** - *If there's a song from this year (or this decade even) that I'd want played at my funeral, it's James Newton Howard's theme from this movie. It's so beautiful and perfectly captures the feel of the movie. That song broke me down every time it played. I can't imagine this movie without it, it's that good. It's a shame this movie is getting ignored this awards season.*

**Never Look Away - 8/10**

**Toy Story 4 - 8/10**

**Pavarotti - 8/10**

**The Biggest Little Farm - 8/10**-  *If you're really into the inner-workings of a Californian farm, then this is the documentary for you.*

**Abominable - 8/10**  

**The Current War - 7/10** 

**Artic  - 7/10** - *Well made, solidly-acted. I loved the small details about survival that this movie brings up, makes it very grounded and realistic. I'm kinda bored of survival movies in general so this didn't blow my mind or anything.*

**Bombshell - 7/10**

**Honey Boy - 7/10** - *Pretty big letdown because I had really high expectations for this one. Lacked the emotional punch I hoped for. Didn't land for me at all, kind of like Boy Erased last year. I appreciate how honest and revealing it was, took a lot of guts for Shia LaBeouf to put this out there but it's forgettable. Lucas Hedges' Shia impression was reallllly on point though, that was worth the price of admission right there. Mid90s last year was a 10/10 for me and I expected the same for this. It was good, not great.*

**American Woman - 7/10** - *Sienna Miller's performance in this is awards-worthy. The accent she does is perfect and it might be the most underrated role of the year. The movie gets way too tearjerky at the end though. It's basically 2 hours of bad shit happening to a good person, which gets a bit overwhelming.*

**The Beach Bum - 7/10**

**Captain Marvel - 7/10**

**Spies In Disguise - 7/10** - *Looked pretty generic based on the trailer, but was actually pretty funny.*

**Cold Pursuit - 7/10**

**Tolkien - 7/10** - *Not much happens but it felt really comfortable. Solid performances all around and they handled the WW1 scenes better than I thought they would. Expected to be bored out of my mind based on the reviews and trailer but it flowed well. As far as ""Nicholas Hoult Biopics of Famous Writers"" go, it's miles ahead of Rebel in the Rye 2 years ago.*

**Jumanji: The Next Level - 7/10**

**Sauvage/Wild - 7/10**

**Detective Pikachu - 7/10**

**Maiden - 7/10**

**Dark Waters - 7/10** - . *Good performances and an okay script, even though it beats you over the head sometimes. Total waste of Anne Hathaway. She's way too good of an actress for a boring, generic, 'supporting wife' role with just a few lines. Not even sure why she was in this. Overall, a solid legal-thriller, which is a genre I really enjoy and I've been missing since its late-90s heyday. Pretty crazy story too, scummy and evil corporate greed is always interesting to explore on film (like The Insider). Should've been 20 minutes shorter and less on-the-nose*

**Adopt A Highway - 7/10**

**The Wedding Guest - 7/10**

**The Hummingbird Project - 7/10**

**Motherless Brooklyn - 7/10**

**The Lion King - 7/10**

**Last Christmas - 7/10** - *It's really easy to bash this movie, a lot of the humor falls flat and the twist is ridiculous, but I couldn't help walking out with a smile. I love how committed Emilia Clarke was to the character, and her interactions with her boss and family were legitimately heart-warming at times. Also did I mention how ridiculous that twist is?*

**Richard Jewell  - 7/10** - *This was decent. Even though it's clearly Clint Eastwood's personal crusade (and thinly-veiled propaganda piece in some regards) against the FBI & the Spooky Media™, it still told the story effectively/semi-believably. Some of the characters (Hamm/Wilde obviously) were pretty ridiculous caricatures though, was hard to take anything they said seriously, I mean come on. You just roll your eyes at most of what they say. Some of the situations and encounters are too-conveniently set-up but that's easy to overlook. It had very solid performances (Hauser was great, especially when he finally let's his emotion show, in that scene where he kicks the table). Much better than The Mule, and 20x better than 15:17 To Paris.*

**Star Wars: Rise of Skywalker - 7/10**

**21 Bridges - 7/10**

**Before You Know It - 7/10**

**Hobbs & Shaw - 7/10** - *This is peak ""Stupid Summer Popcorn Movie"" and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It's The Meg of 2019*.

**Fighting With My Family - 7/10**

**Pet Sematary  - 7/10**

**Downton Abbey - 7/10** - *Never saw a single episode of the show before watching the movie, but it still felt familiar/safe to jump right in.*

**Yesterday - 7/10**

**Greta  - 7/10** - *It's a cheesy, predictable, non-scary horror film but I liked it. Sometimes you just need Isabelle Hupert to play a psychopathic serial killer. Felt very old-school, a movie straight out of the 1980s.*

**Judy - 7/10** - *It's the definition of Oscar bait and is emotionally manipulative, especially towards the end, but it does a great job at humanizing a Hollywood legend.*

**Frozen 2  - 7/10**

**Aladdin - 7/10**

**The Souvenir - 7/10**

**Zombieland 2: Double Tap - 7/10** - *Nowhere near as memorable/iconic as the first one, but it still got a bunch of laughs from me (especially the Thomas Middleditch/Luke Wilson scene). Above-average for a comedy-sequel, but I could see this one not aging well*.

**The Two Popes - 6/10** - *Two solid performances but underwhelming overall, too many cheap-looking flashback scenes, not enough Pryce/Hopkins. Reminded me of Can You Ever Forgive Me? last year, depending on the 2 leads to carry a weak movie/premise on their back, to disappointing results. Highly-overrated movie.*

**Ready Or Not - 6/10**

**Anna - 6/10** - *It's basically Red Sparrow but slightly worse*.

**Saint Frances  - 6/10**

**Hotel Mumbai - 6/10** 

**Shazam! - 6/10** - *Low-stakes, formulaic, superhero movie clearly made with strict budget limitations. It hits all the notes you'd expect a movie like this to hit. It was decent.*

**Alita: Battle Angel - 6/10**

**Loro - 6/10** - *One of the more disappointing movies of the year. On paper it sounds amazing, a sprawling biopic of an infamous/corrupt Italian politician/mogul by Paolo Sorrentino who's not that far removed from a masterpiece? Sign me the fuck up. But nah, this was a shallow, surface-level (like my reviews), pointless dull knife of a biopic. Too much shoehorned religious imagery too. Tone is all over the place. It can't decide whether it's serious or funny and gets lost in-between. It looked nice at least. It also wins this year's ""Most Nudity"" award, easily beating the rest of the field.*

**Teen Spirit - 6/10**

**The Upside - 6/10**

**Gloria Bell - 6/10** - *Great performance from Julianne Moore but this just felt like ""Middle-Aged Crisis: The Movie"". Just couldn't connect to it. I imagine the original is a lot better.*

**On The Basis Of Sex - 6/10**

**Stockholm - 6/10**

**Give Me Liberty  - 6/10**  - *This is an example of a movie that has its heart in the right place but bites off a lot more than it can chew. There's a beautiful, emotional story in here somewhere, but it's too muddled with ineffective editing tricks and too many side-stories. It's sweet in some ways and the true-life characters bring a lot of charm, but it didn't do that much for me. A lot of 'year-end' lists have this as one of the most overlooked movies of the year, but I don't see it. Rough editing, bad soundtrack.*

**Child's Play - 6/10**

**Good Boys - 6/10** - *Just watch Booksmart instead*.

**Styx - 6/10**

**Woman at War - 6/10**

**The Lego Movie 2 -  6/10**

**Missing Link - 6/10**

**Long Shot - 6/10** - *The chemistry between Charlize Theron & Seth Rogen was great but the jokes couldn't really match it. It's a unique mix of politics & humor, but fell short of being an actual crowd-pleaser.*

**Echo in the Canyon - 6/10**

**Cyrano, My Love - 6/10**

**Dora the Explorer - 6/10**

**Brittany Runs A Marathon - 6/10**

**IT: Chapter 2 - 6/10** - *Way too long. Felt like a never-ending series of fetch-quests. Good CGI & acting though.*

**Mister America - 6/10**

**Crawl - 6/10**

**Trial By Fire - 6/10** - *Great performances by Laura Dern & Jack O'Connell get overshadowed by an overly-preacy script. It doesn't let the audience make up its own mind.*

**The Third Wife - 6/10**

**Godzilla: King of Monsters - 5/10** - *This needed less humans, more monsters.*

**Glass - 5/10**

**Escape Room - 5/10**

**Terminator: Dark Fate - 5/10**

**Dumbo - 5/10** 

**All Is True - 5/10**

**Brightburn  - 5/10**

**The White Crow - 5/10** - *One of those biopics where the movie doesn't do justice to the story. Reading the Wikipedia page on this guy's life, you'd except an Oscar contender. Instead it was just okay. Watch Cold War instead. It's basically this movie but better.*

**High Life - 5/10** - *Unpleasant.*

**Where'd You Go Bernadette? - 5/10**

**Scary Stories to Tell Dark - 5/10**

**Her Smell - 5/10** - *This movie made me physically nauseous. The tight, claustrophobic, haze-filled shots in the first 2 acts really threw me off. It's temporarily redeemed by a reallllllly good third act and a solid performance from Elisabeth Moss. But then deflated by a terrible final scene.*

**By the Grace of God - 5/10** - *Based on the critical acclaim, director, and subject matter, I walked in expected to be blown away. Basically expected Spotlight, but this movie completely derails at the halfway point. Hard to sit through*.

**Blinded by the Light - 5/10**

**The Best of Enemies - 5/10**

**The Aeronauts - 5/10** - *This is mis-marketed as an intense survival story but it's really just a boring biopic with too many flashbacks.*

**Fall of the American Empire - 5/10**

**Family - 5/10**

**The Goldfinch - 5/10** - *It turns out an unfilmable novel really is unfilmbable, who would've thought? Shoutout to Jeffrey Wright & Finn Wolfhard for actually trying.*

**Angel Has Fallen - 5/10**

**Gemini Man - 5/10** 

**Late Night  - 5/10**

**Black and Blue  - 5/10** 

**Diane - 5/10** - *This was just depression-porn. Sometimes it works (Mungiu/Zvyagintsev), sometimes it doesn't (this movie). It's such a bummer. Wouldn't recommend this to anyone but Mary Kay Place's performance makes it watchable and engaging sometimes.*

**Destroyer - 5/10**

**How To Train Your Dragon 3 - 5/10**

**Rafiki - 5/10** - *I feel bad for this score because I get that this is a really important/significant movie for African Cinema, but I just couldn't get past the terrible acting, bad (like baaaaaad) dialogue, and lackluster story. Again, pretty big achievement that this got made and reached a global audience, but yeah, in a vacuum, it's undoubtedly a bad movie. Felt like an amateur movie on a shoestring budget.*

**Captive State - 4/10**

**Wild Nights With Emily - 4/10** - *This movie is what happens when someone asks the question ""hey, what if we turned Emily Dickinson's life into an SNL skit?"". I get what they were going for, and Molly Shannon is great, but this was extremely unfunny and probably the longest 84-minute movie I've ever seen.*

**Dark Pheonix - 4/10**

**The Addams Family - 4/10**

**Midway  - 4/10**

**To Dust - 4/10**

**Rojo - 4/10** - *The only memorable thing about this movie is that there was a power outage about 90 minutes in so they comped my ticket and gave me a free drink. So that was cool, I guess.*

**The Kid Who Would Be King - 4/10**

**MIB: International - 4/10**

**The Kid - 4/10** - *There's a 98% chance that this movie is some kind of tax write-off or money laundering scheme. It somehow got 2 big names (Pratt & Hawke), co-starring the son of the producer in his first movie ever. Directed by Vincent D'Onofrio for some reason (???). Was dumped by Lionsgate in a few hundred theaters with 0 marketing/promotion, and flopped hard. It's dated, boring, and unoriginal. Cheesy dialogue. Literally a story that's been told a million times before, usually in much better ways. No reason for this to exist. Chris Pratt has the worst fake-movie-beard of all time in this, that's kinda worth checking out.*

**Ramen Shop - 4/10**

**The Good Liar - 4/10**- *The most convoluted, needlessly-complicated plot of the year. Helen Mirren & Ian McKellen both phone it in (I don't blame them, they were given trash to work with). I hate when movies try to crowbar ""WW2 flashbacks"" into their movies when it's not needed.*

**Climax - 4/10**

**Harriet - 4/10** 

**Lucy in the Sky - 4/10** - *Once or twice a year, a movie comes along that has such a frustrating/stupid/anti-climactic ending it makes me actually angry. This is that movie. Natalie Portman had another movie like that last year (Vox Lux). Hey Noah Hawley, what the fuck?*

**Freaks - 4/10** - *This movie would fit well in the ""Good Idea But Bad Execution"" subreddit.*

**Tel Aviv On Fire - 4/10**

**Ma - 4/10**

**Frankie  -  3/10**

**Stuber - 3/10**

**Serenity - 3/10** - *In a year full of batshit-crazy twists (looking at you, Last Christmas), this easily had the batshit-iest twist. It's something you actually have to experience yourself, and be fully-immersed in it, to appreciate how mind-numblingly crazy it is. How they got A-list talent for this script is a total mystery, but it probably involves of a lot of favors and cocaine. It's almost ""so bad its good"". Almost. I can't wait for the sequel, Free Guy, next year.*

**Maleficent 2: Mistress of Evil - 3/10** - *More genocide than I expected for a live-action Disney fairy tale movie.*

**Donnybrook - 3/10**

**The Photograph - 3/10** - *Zzzzzzzzzz...*

**Charlie's Angels - 3/10**

**Hellboy - 3/10** - *This movie is like that annoying kid in middle school that tries way to hard to be edgy. It's gory and vulgar just for the sake of being gory & vulgar. It reminded me of the Predator reboot last year, had the same kind of dated/forced humor that seems to have no real target audience (except for the aforementioned middle school edgy kid I guess). Bad CGI and a boring villain. iirc it also had a lame sequel-bait ending which I hate.*

**Happy Death Day 2U** - 3/10 - 

**The Sun Is Also A Star** - 3/10 - *It's filmed like a generic music video and has the emotional depth of a puddle.*

**Don't Let Go** - 3/10

**The Invisibles** - 3/10

**Playing with Fire  - 3/10** - *This was just like Mark Wahlberg's Instant Family last year, except that it was worse in every imaginable way. No lie, the end-credits bloopers were by far better than anything else in the movie. It was the only time I even chuckled or felt any type of emotion.*

**Cats - 2/10** - *There's not much more I could say that already hasn't been said. Yes, it was bad. No, it wasn't the worst movie in history. For me, it was just so boring. Forgettable songs (except Beautiful Ghosts), no story/plot, nonsensical ending. Just wanted it to end. Jennifer Hudson just floating into space for no reason, Judi Dench giving me unwarranted lessons about raising cats, Ian McKellen slurping milk from a bowl, Extremely-Hairy-And-Naked-Idris-Elba, Cockroach Genocide, etc. These things all happened and we can't change them, and for us to grow as a society, we need to just move on and learn from our mistakes.*

**Rambo: Last Blood - 2/10**

**The Sound of Silence - 2/10** - *More like The Sound of Boredom, amirite? No but seriously, that's all I got. This movie was the closest I got to falling asleep in my seat this year.*

**Synonyms - 2/10**

**Black Christmas - 2/10** - *Extremely cheesy dialogue, cop-out violence, boring/predictable jump scares, low production value (bad even for a low-end Blumhouse movie), some of the worst one-liners you've ever heard, unrealistic/2D characters. Shitty ending. Wayyyyy too heavy-handed with the message. About as subtle as a flying brick to the forehead. Amateur acting, cutaway for every death, etc etc.*

**After the Wedding - 2/10** - *Overacted, muddled garbage.*

**47 Meters Down Uncaged - 1/10**

**Shaft - 1/10** - *Crude, unfunny, soulless, grating, pointless. There's a million adjectives I could use to describe this reboot, and none of them are positive. This is one I'm surprised I didn't just walk out of. Probably didn't have anything better do do that day.*

**Jexi - 1/10** - *This year's worst movie. It's just the kind of movie that leaves a bad taste in your mouth, like you need to watch something else to get the stink of this one out of your mind. It was just so mean-spirited, from start to finish. Not a single joke landed, you just hated all of the characters. There are no redeeming factors. On the technical side, it was very basic, looked like a cheap music video. No memorable scenes, no good lines of dialogue, no originality in any way. None of the ""cheerful""/""pick-me-up"" moments earn any kind of emotional reaction. If you had a freshman high-school film student remake Her as a shitty comedy, this would be it. The fact that I paid money to see this is something I will never live down.*

**Other:**

* The longest stretch I went without going to the movies was from July 21st thru August 20th, without a single trip to the movies. Partially due to an out-of-country trip and personal stuff. During this time I ""missed out"" on **The Kitchen**, **The Nightingale**, **Brian Banks**, and **Honeyland**. Mostly caught up to the rest.
* The most theater visits in a one-week span was November 1st thru November 8th, with 8 movies that week.
* The most in one day was 3 movies in theaters on March 15th, 2019 (**Styx**, **To Dust**, and **Captive State**).
* There were 26 double-headers this year (two movies in theaters during the same day, usually back-to-back).

Our protagonist, John, develops a hate for the society that created his life in John Wick 1 &amp; 2. Then, in Constantine, John carries out with his final efforts of defiance in order to see his beloved in the afterlife. All of the other characters referring to him as “John” goes a very long way in creating this fun continuity, but it’s Keanu’s cold and calculated demeanor that makes Constantine feel like a sequel in a series about our protagonist. In addition, John develops a quasi-romance with a new woman, though it never actually goes anywhere. In the John Wick series, that would have been ridiculous. But as a contiguous story about our pal John, it actually fits the narrative. I encourage anyone who enjoys either of those films to approach them as a series, it will create some genuinely entertaining continuity. "

ffyvir,movies,Nicolas Cage made 29 direct-to-video movies in the 2010s. I watched all of them.,"A couple of weeks ago, I showed my son National Treasure, and the whole time I kept thinking “damn, I really miss Nic Cage”. I knew that he was pretty much in the DTV world for the past 10 years, but I didn’t realize to what level. Turns out that Nicolas Cage made 29 direct-to-video movies in the 2010’s, and almost immediately, I was determined to watch every one of them. So I did. In no particular order:  
  
**The Trust. 7/10.**  
A not half-bad way to start things off. It's a little under-cooked at a brisk 90 minutes, but him and Elijah Wood play well of each other. Cage gives his character some quirky traits in the first half coming across as a likeable guy trying to do something he shouldn't, but quickly turns to full-on bad guy in the second half. There's a good story here but it's never fully realized. We are treated to a Cage Out though in the third act, which is always welcome. 1 down, 28 to go.  
  
**Kill Chain. 8/10.**  
This one was really enjoyable! It's sort-of 3 different stories or vignettes that all come together in the second half, which is where Cage enters the picture. He never Cage's Out, playing pretty restrained the whole time (though there is one moment where he comes close). The writing's a bit ham-fisted, and the characters are pure stereotype, but it's well crafted and a very entertaining 90 minutes. So far so good. With 27 to go, things are looking up!  
  
**The Runner. 5/10.**  
Unfocused and uneventful. It’s well cast and there’s a feeling of “this is a real movie” but it wants to be too many things. There’s a decent movie buried in here, but at a brisk 82 minutes, it’s hard to find. There’s no Cage Rage on display here, instead playing it very understated. It’s quality acting though. Three films into this little odyssey, and so far these are more than just paychecks for him, doing the best he can with what he’s given.  
  
**Rage. 6/10.**  
It’s OK, but it’s sloppy. The whole time I’m wondering why nothing seems to piece together, and it’s ultimately all in service of a shock ending that undermines everything that came before. Once again, Cage is solid in this. He keeps things entertaining where others may have had me checking out. One intense Cage Out, but I expected more based on the title and premise. Nevertheless, we journey forward. 4 down, 25 to go.  
  
**Between Worlds. 10/10.**  
I’m going to be fast and loose with the spoilers on this one. Joe is a down-on-his-luck truck driver who lost his wife and kid to a house fire some years prior. In the first 10 minutes of the movie, Joe is at a gas station pit stop where he finds Julie being choked out by some dude. Joe steps in and knocks him out, much to her dissatisfaction. Why? Because 1 hour prior, her daughter was in a motorcycle accident and is now in a coma, and because of a childhood incident, knows that if she is unconscious she can cross over to “the other side”. So her plan was to have some rando choke her in a rest stop bathroom so she could guide her daughter back to the land of the living. Joe interrupted the process, so he offers to give her a ride to the hospital. Once there, she asks Joe to choke her in the hallway so she can try again to reach her. “Something” goes wrong, and instead, Joe’s dead wife is brought back in the daughters body.  
The next 30 minutes see Joe moving in with Julie and playing house while dead-wife-in-daughter (DWID from this point on) slowly creeps around trying to seduce him. It’s the halfway point when Joe is made aware what is happening, and by extension Julie and the movies 1 other character. They all accept this very easily.  
It’s around this time that we get to a scene where Joe and DWID are fucking, interspersed with a scene where Joe and his wife before she died are also fucking. In both of these scenarios, his wife wants him to read poetry while they fuck. The poetry Joe proceeds to read in both scenes is from a book titled, I shit you not, “Memories by Nicolas Cage”.  
More stuff happens, and at the end of the movie, through various circumstances, Joe is doing a classic Cage scream-cry, one arm hugging a jack-in-the-box that presumably belonged to his daughter, and in the other, he is dousing himself in gasoline. He then lights a cigarette, which of course ignites his entire body, and he smokes in a completely normal manner while his body burns. This all happens while Leader of the Pack is playing, a song that holds absolutely no significance to anything that has come prior.  
Throughout, music that feels directly ripped from Twin Peaks is playing, and the whole atmosphere is begging to feel like David Lynch. Is the kind of movie you would find on Cinemax at 2am on a random Wednesday in 1995. It’s fucking glorious.  
At this particular moment in my life, my greatest fear is that with 24 films to go, I will never again reach these heights.  
  
**Inconceivable. 7/10.**  
It’s your typical nanny-isn’t-who-they-seem-to-be sort of deal, but it’s actually entertaining enough. It’s all pretty rote stuff, but there’s nothing offensively bad here. Cage gets 4th billing, with absolutely nothing to do other than play the can’t-see-what’s-really-going-on husband. He’s still decent at it, but this actually does feel like a paycheck movie for him, given that I can’t find any reason he would have looked at the script and thought he had something interesting he could do.  
  
**The Humanity Bureau. 3/10.**  
Lame, cheap, uninteresting near-future story that doesn’t have anything new to say that hasn’t already been said better in dozens of other movies. Cage is actually asleep at the wheel on this one, just kind of making his way through. In fairness, he isn’t given anything to do. Thus far, these movies have managed pretty decent supporting casts. Here though, it’s pretty much Canadian TV extras. Things are starting to feel rocky with 22 left.  
  
**Outcast. 4/10.**  
Meh. Anakin Skywalker is a 12th Century Knight escorting hunted royalty to safe haven. It’s surprisingly not as cheap as I expected, but it’s a completely unoriginal and boring movie. My only reason for watching, Sir Nicolas, does not even enter the picture until the final 30 minutes. He really hams it up with the old English accent, but he can’t save the movie at this point. Things are gonna need to start turning around soon. Maybe a Between Worlds injection every 3 movies.  
  
**Primal. 6/10.**  
A movie where a Jaguar, a killer and Nicolas Cage are all loose on a boat in the middle of the ocean should not be this dull. It’s no fault of Cage, who hurls some great insults throughout when not chomping on a cigar, and the rest of the cast seems game (except you, Jean Grey), so it really comes down to the film itself, which just doesn’t use its premise to the fullest. The whole thing is visually bland, too. It’s so muted it borders on black and white sometimes.  
I had high hopes going in, but thanks to this little journey of mine, I now know director Nick Powell from yesterday’s Outcast endeavor, and as soon as his name popped up in the opening credits, those hopes came crashing down.  
  
**Running with the Devil. 7/10.**  
Flawed and sloppily made, but still entertaining enough, mostly due to its surprisingly A-list cast that never gets to do much. It's not nearly as cool as it wants to be though. What Feast made a great joke about in its opening few minutes, this movie tries to do for real, to eye rolling effect. Cage is very low-key in this, with Laurence Fishburne of all people having the most fun. His characters sexual proclivities serve no purpose, and an early montage of them would be pointless if he wasn't so much fun to watch. Perhaps the biggest disappointment though is that Nicolas Cage and Adam Goldberg get some screen time together, and rather than take this opportunity to have them out-anxious each other, nothing comes of it. I'm so d-d-d-d-d-disappointed.  
  
**A Score to Settle. 8/10.**  
Went in expecting a typical revenge flick, but was pleasantly surprised to see something more. Cage is really great in this, and I'm more and more impressed by him with each movie. He really disappears into each role, never doing the same thing twice even if he sometimes is playing similar characters. There are a few moments of the Cage Madness here, much in the same way that Christopher Walken or Sam Rockwell try to dance in every movie they do, but the more subdued acting takes center stage.  
  
**The Frozen Ground. 8/10.**  
Tight cat-and-mouse type that focuses on the procedural more than the thriller aspect and is better for it. Cage is in top form, and Cusack ain't half bad either. Might I want to dip my toe into his DTV output next? Perhaps. 17 to go first.
  
**211. 1/10.**  
Jesus Fucking Christ.  
  
**Dying of the Light. 6/10.**  
**Dark. 7/10.**  
As it exists in its official form, it’s a middling CIA thriller with an intriguing Cage performance being the most interesting part.  
In it’s “Director’s Cut”, which is even less of an actual movie than Donner’s Superman II, everything is much more intriguing, and had Schrader been able to make an actual final cut, this could have had the potential to be great.
The concept of a dying CIA agent spending his last days trying to catch a dying terrorist is a solid one, but it isn’t fully realized in either version as is. Cage’s performance is a little manic in both, but more fleshed out and sympathetic in the later. CIA business aside, I’d have liked to watch 90 minutes of Cage just losing his mind. Actually that movie could be 3 hours long and still not be enough.  
  
**Stolen. 9/10.**  
A cheap Taken knock-off crossed with a heist movie that’s a stupid amount of fun. Josh Lucas is gloriously unhinged here, out Cage-ing the man himself. Can the remaining 14 keep up?  
  
**Arsenal. 5/10.**  
DTV mediocrity that tries too hard to be cool. Cage is hamming it up in a small-ish role, and certainly makes his scenes entertaining, but the rest of the DTV-All-Stars are bland.  
  
**Seeking Justice. 8/10.**  
It’s packaged as a revenge thriller, but it’s much more in line with 13 Sins/The Game/Nerve. The whole thing is pretty ridiculous, but it’s a lot of fun to watch. It doesn’t use its New Orleans setting as well as Stolen, but the two would make for a hell of a double feature.  
  
**Dog Eat Dog. 7/10.**  
Weird movie, but compellingly so. Shrader gets his editing jollies off that he couldn’t do on Dying of the Light, but I’m not sure it does much to add to a movie that is otherwise a pretty simple tale of low-level criminals wanting to hit it big. Cage and Dafoe is a great pairing, but it’s never fully utilized, outside of an odd, half-naked condiment fight.  
  
**Vengeance: A Love Story. ?/10.**  
After the first 10 minutes, where you can fill a card 100% while playing Cop Trope Bingo, you get the deformed child of two very different movies. In the first movie you have a fairly dark, if poorly constructed, movie about the aftermath of an assault and rape where any one aspect of which could have been explored, but instead the writer and director give us a Whitman's Sampler of plot threads with none of them fleshed out beyond the initial idea. Nicolas Cage is not in this movie.  
In the second movie however, Nicolas Cage stars in what I can only think to describe of as City of Angels 2. After tragically losing his dear Maggie to that damn logging truck, Seth moves out of LA and assumes the identity of John Drormoor, becoming a policeman who years later becomes involved in the lives of a mother and daughter in the aftermath of a violent attack. After what is obviously Seth/John trying to communicate with Cassiel at the edge of a waterfall for guidance, he is given a much warranted promotion from Angel to Avenging Angel, serving due justice to the duos attackers.  
These two movies have been edited together. I don't know how to give this a numbered rating. There are 10 remaining.  
  
**USS Indianapolis: Men of Courage. 3/10.**  
A poorly made movie that plays like a work of complete fiction. The use of a famous quote 50 years before it was coined is particularly atrocious, as is Tom Sizemore, acting as though he were Tobias Fünke trying his best at an Academy Award.
This is the first straight-up bad movie thus far. Up until this point they’ve either crossed over into so-bad-they’re-good or Cage has given a performance that keeps things entertaining and watchable. USS Indianapolis is just a lame movie across the board.  
  
**Joe. 7/10.**  
A solid movie with a really great performance by Cage, but I found its most engaging storyline sidelined by too many others that make the movie feel really long. There is no fun to be had here, and little worth revisiting down the road.  
  
**Color Out of Space. 8/10.**  
Delivered what I was hoping for on most accounts, but continues to prove that adapting Lovecraft, especially on a low budget, is very difficult. There are some real horrors on display though proving that practical effects are still king, and Cage is great, showing again his talent and desire to really put his all into every role.  
  
**Grand Isle. 6/10.**  
A came cast keeps things going for the first hour, which is essentially a single location play, but it all starts to fall apart in the third act. Grammer has about 10 minutes of collective screen time and only 30 seconds of those shared with Cage. KaDee Strickland is the most surprising here, matching Cage's enthusiasm and keeping the whole thing very entertaining, but it ultimately amounts to very little. The low-budget also doesn't help, constantly referencing a hurricane that is never seen. A shame really, cause you can see the potential for something greater here.  
  
**Looking Glass. 5/10.**  
A thriller without thrills, trying so hard to be mysterious and failing at each try. Cage is given nothing to do but walk around and look confused for 100 minutes. Things rarely happen, and when they do they make no sense by the end. There's a solid first act setup with some cool ideas, and every single one is wasted. I was hoping for something along the lines of 8MM, but this was not that.  
The final 5 remain.  
  
**Mom and Dad. 8/10.**  
A deranged concept which Cage is perfectly suited for, but like my issue with Nicholson in The Shining, he’s already a little crazy before he goes crazy. I love the tone set with the opening credits, but Taylor goes to frenetic too quickly, never letting us settle in before cranking things up to 11.  
All that aside, it’s a totally bonkers movie and watching Cage let loose is always 100% entertainment. As a whole it just lacks the finesse to bump this up to top tier.  
  
**Trespass. 8/10.**  
There’s more than a few stupid character decisions, and I don’t love the way the flashback structure is done, but the performances across the board are really good, and the intensity level is consistent throughout.  
  
**Pay the Ghost. 7/10.**  
A pretty decent spookfest that creates a moody atmosphere and some chilling imagery. While “Color Out of Space” falls in the horror genre, and Cage has done more than a few thrillers, this is the only actual scary movie he’s ever done. I’d like to see more.  
  
**Army of One. 4/10.**  
Cage sounds like he’s doing a Rain Man impression the entire time, and the movie is narrated in a Wake Up, Ron Burgundy style which is just awful. A very unfunny movie that is more annoying than anything else.  
  
**Mandy. 10/10.**  
There was no better way to end this journey. Cage is smartly restrained for a majority of the picture, but when the beast is let loose, THE BEAST IS LET LOOSE! A fever dream of a movie that delivers on all accounts, and something that will be re-watched in years to come.

EDIT: In order to keep the title streamlined I said ""direct-to-video"". Perhaps what I should have said was ""movies that did not have a nationwide theatrical release"".

EDIT 2: You are all incredibly kind! I very much enjoyed this, and it only furthered my appreciation for Nic Cage. He currently has 4 movies in post-production, and I’m eager to watch each one of them. To answer a common question, each movie was reviewed on its own merits, and not on any sort of curve or in-comparison to another movie.

EDIT 3: How did I watch them? [The right way.](https://imgur.com/a/qYIKxUW)

k6ze6l,movies,My 12 year old is pissed at me because he accidentally proved that Die Hard is indeed a Christmas movie. [SPOILERS],"Last year, I introduced him to Die Hard and I said it was one of my favorite Christmas movies. All year long, he has been trying to argue that it's not a Christmas movie per se, it's just a movie that happens at Christmastime. 

My argument was that the whole reason John McClane was even in Los Angeles was to see his family for Christmas and the only reason he was at Nakatomi Plaza was for the Xmas party. He wasn't having it. 

So tonight I introduced Lethal Weapon, which honestly, I had forgotten was also set around Christmas. But there we are, watching the opening credits and they're playing jingle bell rock, everything is decorated for Xmas, everyone's saying ""Merry Christmas"" to each other. So I start saying ""look, another Christmas movie like Die Hard!"" because I know he's going to argue that it's not. 

He impressed me this time: he said that if you take Christmas out, it doesn't change the story. And he's 100% right; Lethal Weapon can stand on its own without the story changing even if it happens in the third week of August. Christmas is not at all integral to any part of that movie. 

So I pointed out that Gruber's gang in Die Hard needed the reduced security and number of employees in the building for a nighttime Christmas party for them to get into the building easier, but they also needed enough employees at the party to create a hostage situation that would get the FBI out so they could turn off the power, letting them drill into the vault. 

You take Xmas out and they don't have their opportunity to make their heist. 

And again, McClane is in that building specifically because it's Christmas. 

No Christmas, no Die Hard. 

He's not happy about it. 

So tomorrow we're going to have to watch Love Actually and see what he thinks."

So I went and looked it up and sure enough, Disney/Pixar has won the Oscar in this category every single year they had a movie up for nomination, since 2006 (in 2011, they didn’t have a movie up for nomination AND YES, as everyone keeps asking in the comment section: Rango won this year. Disney did not have a movie nominated, and Rango won, and no, Rango is not a Disney movie). In 2006, they lost the Oscar to Happy Feet (the Disney movie up for nomination was Cars).

As much of a Disney movie lover as I am, I’m so glad that the Academy didn’t just blindly hand over the award to Disney again, but actually chose the best of the bunch. And I’m so glad it’s Into The Spider-Verse. This movie deserves it.

Edit: to all those confused about Marvel’s role in this movie, u/Viceprezbacon has a great comment below summarizing the relationships:
“To all confused about Disney and Spiderman. Sony owns the rights to spiderman. The Marvel attributed with being involved with this movie is the comic book company. Disney was in no way involved with this movie. They own Marvel Studios, who produce the live action movies and have no affiliation with Sony in this regard (outside the spiderman deal).”"

Seriously, STOP FUCKING DOING THAT.  I KNOW YOUR SHOWS FUCKING EXIST.  LET ME HAVE AT LEAST A COUPLE OF MINUTES OF COMEDOWN BEFORE SHOVELING YOUR NEXT SERIES IN MY GODDAMN FACE ALREADY"".

I mean, shit, if even there was a button that said ""let me watch the end credits"" I'd be OK with it, but NOPE THERE'S FUCKING NOTHING.

Netflix, you had our backs five years ago, and now you're just as fucking bad as anyone else.  LISTEN TO ME, STOP THIS SHIT.

(((( MEGA EDIT ))))

 Well... holy smokes, le blow up... and some of you have no sense of humour.  A few comments.

a) I don't hate Netflix in general.  People saying ""just stop paying for it"" are being ridiculous.  I even get that a lot of people *like* the autoplay feature, which is great.  I just don't like that it's *automatic* and there's no option to turn it off (for me, at least).

b) I think for some reason you guys have options when you watch that I don't.  None of your suggestions work for me, or seem available.  Probably depends how you're watching Netflix.  I'm using a Sony smart TV.  Maybe I truly am ""retarded"", as some of you insist.  But I don't have the settings menu ya'll are talking about, that's for sure.

c) I'm howling at the comments about ""entitlement"".  Uh, what?  I'm paying for a service here, not asking for my student loans to be cleared.  If we don't like something we're paying for, we're ""entitled"" so say something about it.

d) As for the ""don't get so excited"" posts.  Well, firstly, alcohol.  Secondly, obviously the issue isn't that big of a deal, that's why the obviously over the top response.  I dunno, I thought it was funny.  Certainly didn't think anyone would care about it.  What's really interesting is how pissed off people get that I even posted it in the first place.  Oh, sorry, let's get back to how exciting that fifth poster is for (insert 483rd Marvel sequel here).

e) Some of you don't sit through the credits.  That's cool, but some of us (apparently a *lot* of us) do.  

f) If you've never gotten to the end of a film and felt the need to sit there and think about it for a bit... that's... really sad.

g) Weirdly, the thing that set me off was *Blue Thunder*.  I loved this movie as a kid, loved the shitty electronic score... so when I got the end I'm like ""oh yeah, there's this extendo version of the theme which was pretty sweet"" and then I get there and BOOM it's like NO MUSIC ONLY TRAILER.  And it made me thought of other times when I wanted to just relax and think about what I'd seen, and popped.  Er, half-popped.  "

Some of these reviews are legit ""worst of the year"" contenders. Lots of savage (and hilarious) 1/10 or 2/10 reviews. This movie just went from Oscar-hopeful to Razzies-favorite. It's a total trainwreck.

On the bright side, there will at least be some award-winning puns/memes to come out of this. Looks like the trailer backlash was warranted after all.

> It's amazing to see what Adult Swim can accomplish with a $100 million budget.

> Glad to report that Cats is everything you’d hoped for and more: a mesmerisingly ugly fiasco that makes you feel like your brain is being eaten by a parasite. A viewing experience so stressful that it honestly brought on a migraine.

[Indiewire](https://www.indiewire.com/2019/12/cats-review-tom-hooper-andrew-lloyd-webber-1202198087/) 

> Tom Hooper’s feline musical is an absurd and exuberant mess. This visually dense adaptation of the Andrew Lloyd Webber hit is at once too crazy for this world, and not quite crazy enough.

[Newsday](https://www.newsday.com/entertainment/movies/cats-movie-review-1.39629221)

> Fans of the stage musical may swoon, but others will be severely allergic.

[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/cats-film-review-musical-movie-2019-taylor-swift/) 

> Andrew Lloyd Webber’s feline fantasy musical becomes a garish hairball. It’s hard to “ruin” Webber’s already strange musical, but Tom Hooper’s wrongheaded attempt certainly tries. Tom Hooper’s jarring fever dream of a spectacle is like something that escaped from Dr. Moreau’s creature laboratory instead of a poet’s and a composer’s feline (uni)verse, an un-catty valley hybrid of physical and digital that unsettles and crashes way more often than it enchants. 

[Bleeding Cool](https://www.bleedingcool.com/2019/12/18/cats-review-a-bad-musical-adapted-into-a-worse-movie/)

> Cats is a strange beast to begin with, but the combination of strange CGI makes the translation from stage to screen even worse.

[Slant](https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/review-tom-hoopers-cats-is-a-chaotic-tribute-to-a-dire-cultural-artifact/)

> This adaptation gets straight to the heart of the material, which is basically two hours of stray cats introducing themselves.

[Rendy Reviews](https://www.rendyreviews.com/movies//cats-review)

> On a scale of one to Zemeckis, Hooper's Cats boldly goes beyond the uncanny valley and creates a tier of its own.

Screen Junkies

> A spectacular disaster...This movie feels like a prank but I don't know on whom.

[The Jam Report](https://thejamreport.com/2019/12/19/review-cats-is-the-most-inexplicably-bizarre-film-of-the-year/)

> The most inexplicably bizarre film of the year, it's jawdropping for all the wrong reasons.

[RTE Ireland](https://www.rte.ie/entertainment/movie-reviews/2019/1218/1101984-cats-is-a-twee-and-irksome-furrago-of-a-movie/)

> First off, full disclosure - I am not a cat person. Second off - after watching this frankly mortifying film adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's Cats, I'm not altogether sure I am a movie person anymore either.

Not only have they starred in some of the strangest films to date but their involvement has often helped secure funding for independent directors who might otherwise struggle to find the money. Elijah Wood even runs his own production company to help up and coming directors get their weird and wonderful ideas to the big screen. 

I'd love to see the three of them get together for the weirdest, most bizarre and out there independent film imaginable. If the stars of Swiss Army Man, Come to Daddy and High Life can't do it, then no one can!"

kxb3f6,movies,The transformation of Rambo from broken veteran to unstoppable killing machine is a real cultural loss.,"There really isn’t a more idiotic devolution of a character in modern popular culture than that of Rambo. If you haven’t seen the first film, First Blood, it’s a quite cynical and anti-military movie. Rambo isn’t a psychotic nationalist, he’s a broken machine. He was made to be an indestructible soldier by an uncaring military at the cost of his humanity. He’s a character so good at violence it scares him, and the only person he actually kills in the first film is both in self defense and largely on accident. It’s not even an action film, it’s a drama about veterans who cannot re-enter society after a meaningless war. The climax of the film isn’t Rambo killing, but sobbing about how horrifying his experiences were.

Then, in the second film, we get a neck shattering 180 into full on Ronald Reagan revisionism of the war in Vietnam. Rambo 2 perpetuates several popular and resilient myths about the Vietnam War, such as that American POWs were still there after the war and that the war would have been won by Americans of only we (the American people) had allowed them to win.

To say Rambo 2 is cultural vandalism would be putting it mildly. It’s a cinematic tragedy. They took a poignant anti war film and made it into a jingoistic Cold War fantasy."

It sunk quicker than expected. 90 minutes later, divers retrieved the film from the seabottom. After development, the footage was found to be ""all there, in full color and clarity.""","From *American Cinematographer*, August edition's interview with Dunkirk Director of Photography Hoyte van Hoytema - 


>They decided to place an Imax camera into a stunt plane - which was 'unmanned and catapulted from a ship,' van Hoytema says - and crash it into the sea. The crash, however, didn't go quite as expected. 

>'Our grips did a great job building a crash housing around the Imax camera to withstand the physical impact and protect the camera from seawater, and we had a good plan to retrieve the camera while the wreckage was still afloat,' van Hoytema says. 'Unfortunately, the plane sunk almost instantly, pulling the rig and camera to the sea bottom. In all, the camera was under for [more than 90 minutes] until divers could retrieve it. The housing was completely compromised by water pressure, and the camera and mag had filled with [brackish] water. But Jonathan Clark, our film loader, rinsed the retrieved mag in freshwater and cleaned the film in the dark room with freshwater before boxing it and submerging it in freshwater.' 


>[1st AC Bob] Hall adds, 'FotoKem advised us to drain as much of the water as we could from the can, [as it] is not a water-tight container and we didn't want the airlines to not accept something that is leaking. This was the first experience of sending waterlogged film to a film lab across the Atlantic Ocean to be developed. It was uncharted territory.""

7ffkmf,movies,"Galaxy Quest is still one of a kind. It blends the line between being a parody and tribute to Star Trek, while also being a legit Science Fiction film flawlessly","Galaxy Quest is incredible. I can't think of any other film like it. First it's an excellent and loving parody to Star Trek. Second, it's actually a great science fiction adventure film with a good plot. The comedy is great, but the dramatic moments are just as impact. The part where Tim Allen has to explain to Balthzar that they are actors is heartbreaking. Everyone involved with the film seemed to totally understand and buy into what they were making. I can't think of another film that blends the line between parody and drama so flawlessly. Space Balls for example is a great parody, but has no serious sci-fi elements. 

EDIT: When I thought about it, maybe Ghostbusters is the best comparison. It's not a parody in any way, but it blends the line between comedy and it's horror elements perfectly. 

Edit 2: wow I didn't expect this to blow up. Here is an excellent spoiler analysis from one of my favorite youtube channels.

* if **1917** wins, it'll be the first winner with no acting noms or a Screenplay win since **Braveheart** in 1996.

Has any other actor played the same role for so many years that it started as a ""new, fresh take warranting of an oscar"" and later devolved into ""nobody would complain if we nominate this for a Razzie""?"
gyehvk,movies,Edge of Tomorrow is the perfect blockbuster movie,"Seriously, it amazes me that this movie was not a giant hit.  Most modern blockbuster movies feel like the same tired retread of cliches, but Edge of Tomorrow has everything you could want in a fun action movie:

* Dark humor
* Unpredictability
* The protagonist has this huge character arc, which is very unusual for Tom Cruise
* Great action scenes
* Bill Paxton
* Fantastic alien design
* An awesome spin on Groundhog day
* Perfectly encapsulates what it is like to play a tough video game
* Great chemistry between the two lead characters
* If you love Tom Cruise, you'll love this movie.  If you hate Tom Cruise, you'll love this movie because he dies so much.
* The movie both starts quickly and wraps up quickly without it feeling cheap
* A badass female character with a neat backstory that makes her feel more genuine than the usual cliche obligatory female badass character.  Plus, she fights aliens in large mech suit with a frickin' helicopter blade as her sword.
* There isn't a single dull scene

Hopefully someday the stars align and we can finally get a sequel."

With every potential host out there under more and more scrutiny and many actors not wishing to perform the hosting duties. It just seems to make sense to remove all risk and just have The Muppets host it.

* Have Fozzie in a writers room being blamed for all the bad jokes that don't land. Gives writers a freedom to push boundaries a bit knowing the blowback is mitigated because no one outside the writers knows who wrote it and ""Fozzie"" takes the blame.
* Each Guest host can be pared up with a Muppet that matches them to work off of. And those who don't wish to share the stage with a Muppet wont have to.
* They're well known for musical numbers and big productions.
* Animal in the Orchestra pit can just rage out on the drums when a winner is talking too long and glare at them.
* The first half of the Oscars would be able to be watched by families without worrying about more adult/mature humour.
* Coupled with animatronics they could experiment with a bunch of new ways to present The Muppets and their acts.

I'm personally not the biggest fan of the Oscars but was having this discussion with some friends last weekend and we couldn't really think of any negatives to it. It would give the Oscars a much needed boost in popularity - give it a chance to get back some levity and calm - they could host for a few years and then change it back.

What do people think? Would you watch The Muppets presenting The Oscars? Have I got it all wrong?"

Also really good from a narrative potential perspective.  Middle of the film reveal and now your human target is trying in vain to escape his former savior now captor while you can have the good time traveler or terminator conflicted about killing them.  Save it for the end and you can have a really gutteral gut punch especially if you focus on the human protagonists reaction to their role in the Apocalypse.

Plus you can drop really fun hints with The Terminator trying hard to relate to the human protag but being completely unable to because Skynet can't comprehend how human's think and react."
88urzc,movies,I got chastised for being on my cell phone BEFORE THE PREVIEWS STARTED!,"Look... I get that complaining about other movie goers has become a legitimate hobby for many cinephiles, but shit has gone too far. 



Earlier today I went to see the film ""The Death of Stalin"". Side note: it's really good, but it's also exactly the kind of movie that packs in pretentious dipshits. Anyway, I was in my seat, on my phone (browsing the reddit app actually) -- NOT DURING THE OPENING CREDITS -- NOT EVEN DURING THE PREVIEWS -- but during AMC's bullshit ""First Look"" segment, in which Maria Menounos takes you on a journey to discover 'what's hot in Hollywood'. I assume everyone knows what I'm talking about. It's basically 30 minutes of glorified commercials interlaced with actual commercials. 



The couple behind me started talking about how much they hated people who used their cell phone during movies. However, I could only decipher every other sentence and didn't think it was possible that they were passive-aggressively talking about me. But then the guy started clearing his throat in that suggestive way. 



""No..."" I thought, ""there's no way he's angry at me for flipping through my phone during the 'behind the scenes look' at some stupid pre-teen movie both of us will never see."" 



When the ""First Look"" segment ended, I did what you're supposed to do... I turned my phone on silent and put it in my pocket. Keep in mind, this was before the green placard even showed up to announce the first preview. The dude behind me starts clapping. CLAPPING! 



I'm sure he read some post online about some annoying person ruining the movie and the whole audience started clapping to collectively shame them. I'm sure he said to himself ""oh man, next time someone's on their phone in a movie theater, that's what I'm going to do!"" 



At this point, I did something completely counterintuitive to my Minnesotan upbringing -- I turned around and said ""Oh, I'm sorry... did I ruin the commercials for you?"" I got no response and turned back around. Shortly thereafter, while the theater showed that clip asking the audience to silence their cell phones, saying 'Please, don't ruin the movie for others' -- I waited for silence and said ""Also, please, don't ruin the M&M commercials for others"". Admittedly, that move was classic Minnesotan. 



So that's my story. That couple can choke on their sense of entitlement. I'm an extremely polite person when I'm not telling people to choke on things. I care about others enjoyment. But for the love of christ... this 'movie etiquette' movement has overstepped its bounds if I can't check my text messages 20 minutes before the movie starts. 









EDIT: I'm kinda surprised there's as much downvoting as there is with this post. I wrote it during peak anger, but I assure you that I'm actually open to hearing other perspectives. I just can't for the life even invent a reason why phone use pre-previews would cause any harm to someone's moviegoing experience. Is it a Minority Report thing?  Are you trying to prevent future crimes? It just seems to me that people are making up these 'rules' as they go along. Why is phone use considered distracting, but their audible conversation wasn't? To me, it looks a lot like r/gatekeeping -- a need to arbitrarily place oneself above others. "

A trailer shows you key scenes right away to pull you in which ruins the mystery of the story the author is trying to build.

This might be nostalgia because I watched these films in middle school, but the most memorable movie experience at the theater was Inception (opening night, gasping crowd), and Drive. Didn’t know at all what the films were about, just that they were good. Same with Pulp Fiction (not In theaters, unfortunately)

Thank you guys for recommending movies without me having to watch a trailer.

52g657,movies,"There should be a movie starring Vin Diesel and Terry Crews where they (and their group) play D&D together, but it actually acts out the campaign, switching between the table and the setting, a-la ""The Princess Bride"".","I've heard over and over that Vin Diesel and Terry Crews are big nerds who play D&D. I've even heard they play together. Mr. Diesel also seems to have a lot of input into his movies, even having directed a few video games himself. I think with those two in there, there is the making of a phenomenal movie that alternates between a group of friends playing D&D around a table that then has each of those actors playing their characters. Vin plays his character, Terry plays his, the others play their own. Whoever is DMing is also the narrator, and also plays all of the bad guys. 

It opens like it's an actual fantasy movie: Robert Downy Jr. (because that's who I picture in my head, I don't know if he's ever done anything like D&D) is narrating something about our heroes journey, describing them each and how they came together, and the camera pans over a fantasy village. In walks, in fantasy costume, Terry Crews, Vin Diesel, The Rock, Matt Damon, and Patton Oswalt. Patton could play the halfling bard (who wouldn't want to hear him sing?), Matt Damon plays an annoying min-maxing elf who takes too long to do the math and doesn't role-play enough (when his character speaks, he sounds ""out of place"", think when a character talks in ""Drunk History""), and The Rock could be ""the new guy"" (playing an ironically physically weak wizard) at the table to guide the viewer through some of the basics. His charater is still jacked, but he can't do something simple like push a small boulder or lift a tiny wooden cart because his strength stat is 8. 

At the end of the introduction, Terry Crews objects to the description of what he is wearing. It cuts to a big table at one of their houses, everyone sitting around with their character sheets, the board in the middle has their pieces on a graph sheet. Dice everywhere. RDJ has his secret divider set up and the rule-book out in front of them, and they argue about their starting equipment for a minute. RDJ finally caves and it cuts back to the characters, and Terry's character is wearing the ""correct"" armor now. 

I would love to see that. The fantasy parts would be taken seriously like it's an acted out D&D campaign, but it also has the realistic out-of-character relationships and discussions that make up a really important part of any campaign with friends. Plus, I want to see Terry Crews roll a dice, get a perfect 20 and get really excited and start yelling, then cut to Crews in full body armor swinging a broadsword and chopping off an ogre's head in one blow and still yelling, then cutting back to Crews IRL again standing up, yelling, then looking around awkwardly and realizing he got too excited. 

Every villian would be the DM (RDJ again I think just fits, he's just smug and arrogant but also friendly enough), the Ogre is a CGI RDJ, the thief in the hood is him, the big bad monster at the end has his voice. And of course, he's also the narrator. It has comedic potential, it has flashy action and CGI, it has big-name actors doing something ironically nerdy but somehow believable. I think it would make money, what with Hollywoods insistence on making a movie adaptation of everything, but I don't see a D&D movie ever working without acknowledging that it's all still ""pretend"" on some level. Everyone knows D&D, and I read recently that its use in ""Stranger Things"" has led to an increase in sales of D&D stuff lately, so the timing is perfect, too!"

iaufjf,movies,"Not all Netflix movies are bad, it's just that the good ones are so small they don't get attention.","We've all heard it before and it certainly feels like it. However, the bad rep is mostly attached to the heavily marketed, big budget productions. The hidden gems can be mostly found on independently produced, international movies.

I've compiled a list of *some* of what I think are the **best Netflix Originals, both Netflix-produced and distributed (meaning they didn't produce it, but bought the distribution rights after watching it at a festival.)**

* Calibre (2018): Two best friends go hunting and accidentally kill a person. The film is so tense and hard to watch that I had to pause it several times because I couldn't take it. https://www.netflix.com/title/80198478

* Cam (2018): It feels like this movie came out of nowhere and I my expectations were so low that I ended up loving it. It's a horror/thriller in which a cam girl finds her clone doing another live show and her online identity is completely stolen. https://www.netflix.com/title/80177400

* November 13: Attack on Paris: A devastating three-part docuseries about the terrorist attack that took place in Paris November 2015. It features interviews from both the survivors and first responders. I wasn't able to watch more than one episode per day because it's so depressing. https://www.netflix.com/title/80190097

* Sunday's Illness (La Enfermedad del Domingo): A Spanish movie that might feel slow to some, but whose captivating plot and eerie atmosphere will keep you glued to the screen. It's a mother-daughter drama that sometimes feels like a horror movie. A24 fans will love it. https://www.netflix.com/title/80131280

* Tramps (2016): Two aspiring criminals are brought together in what feels like one of the freshest romantic comedies since 500 Days of Summer. https://netflix.com/title/80146759

* Mirage (2018): Another Spanish movie, this time a Sci-Fi thriller in which a storm breaks the space-time continuum which then causes a parallel universe, giving the main character a chance to possibly prevent a tragic accident. Think of it like Frequency meets Fringe. https://www.netflix.com/title/80991158

* I Don't Feel At Home in this World Anymore (2017): A dark comedy where a woman teams up with her eccentric neighbor to get revenge on the people who robbed her apartment. It's extremely entertaining, but when you think about it, it's a weird love story. https://www.netflix.com/title/80100937

* Amanda Knox (2016): True crime fans will enjoy this documentary about an American girl who allegedly murdered a student in Italy. https://www.netflix.com/title/80081155

* Cargo (2018): Martin Freeman stars in this post-apocalyptic thriller about a father trying to find a home for his daughter after a pandemic. https://www.netflix.com/title/80161216

* Audrey and Daisy: This devastating doc explores the suicide of two teenage girls who got sexually assaulted and cyberbullied after drinking at a high school party. https://www.netflix.com/title/80097321

* Shimmer Lake (2017): In a small town, a group of sheriffs try to track down three bank robbery suspects. It's like a watered-down version of Fargo, but still funny and entertaining. https://www.netflix.com/title/80103734 

* The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind (2019): A boy tries to save his family from a famine by learning to build a windmill on his own. https://www.netflix.com/title/80200047

* One of Us (2017): Documentary where some members of Brooklyn's Hasidic community open up about the emotional toll and consequences of trying to leave their community. https://www.netflix.com/title/80118101

* The Discovery (2017): The movie's universe is one where the afterlife has been scientifically proven. The critics kinda trashed this one (it has 44% on Rotten Tomatoes), but as lover of Sci-Fi and metaphysical questions, the film presents a lot of interesting ideas and it's impossible not to be captivated by it if you like those themes. https://www.netflix.com/title/80115857

* Gerald's Game: Based on Stephen King's novel, a woman is left handcuffed to her bed after her husband suddenly dies while trying to spice up their sex life. https://www.netflix.com/title/80128722"

**Notable Box Office Stories:**

* **Solo: A Star Wars Story** \- Normally on a holiday weekend I wait until Tuesday so I can discuss the full scope of how the extra day off affected the major releases. But the results for Solo were so shocking I frankly couldn't wait and wanted to get at that juicy analysis asap.  tracking to open at the worst over $100M for the three\-day weekend may now not even crack $100M after a four day holiday as Solo: A Star Wars Story opened to #1 with $83.3M. It's been strange because I've seen a lot of couching for this number, that it's soft or underwhelming. Let me be more blunt then, this number right here is bad. Really, really, really bad. How bad? Well first off remember Justice League, the megaflop from last year? That film carried a similar budget of around $300M \(Solo's estimates are all over the map with Disney reporting $250M while Deadline reports $300M\+\) and was also a film that was basically shot twice under two different sets of directors. Well that film, for all its woes, opened at $93.8M, a full $10M higher than Solo. Then there's the comparisons to other Disney era Star Wars films. No one expected the spin\-offs to do as well as the episodic ones but compared with Rogue One, Solo is just pitiful. Rogue One opened 46&#37; higher than Solo with $155M and that was in December when films are supposed to be flipped from the usual summer release strategy of opening really big to cushion big drops in the coming weekends. Not to mention that Star Wars has always been much more of a domestic pull then other more lucrative international properties like the MCU and the Fast & Furious films, which brings us to the even worse news.
* **Solo: A Star Wars Story \(cont.\)** \- International was probably never going to save this film but the results are far far worse than everyone predicted as the film opened to a miserable $65M overseas, making the worldwide opening a miserable $148.8M. The film couldn't even crack the best international numbers of the weekend, as Deadpool 2 out grossed it by earning $67M on its second weekend. To put that in context Rogue One opened to $134.9M overseas and Justice League opened to $185M. In fact you can just look at[ the list of overseas openings](http://www.boxofficemojo.com/intl/weekend/opening/) \(thanks u/Greede for showing me that list\) and see the many box office disappointments that opened better, including: The Mummy \($140.7M\), Pacific Rim Uprising \($122.4M\), Thor: The Dark World \($109.4M\), 300: Rise of An Empire \($88.8M\), Wrath of the Titans \($76.1M\), and fellow Disney megabomb alum John Carter \($70.6M\). Every Star Wars film seems to set a new low in China and this one took the cake opening there to just $10.1M \(Rogue One opened to $30M\). Guess disguising the film under the title ""Ranger Solo"" in China didn't really help with the country's continued disinterest in the franchise. As it stands not only will Solo be the only Disney era Star Wars film to not crack $1B, it could very well earn less worldwide than Rogue One made domestically \(and note it has already opened lower worldwide than Rogue One opened domestically\). That is terrible no matter what way you slice it.
* **Solo: A Star Wars Story \(cont.\)**  \-  So what the hell happened here? While the film got worse reviews then Last Jedi the fan vibe seems to be more generally positive including a solid A\- score on Cinemascore. Of course there was the very public firings of original directors, Chris Miller and Phil Lord, and the complete reshooting of the film which ballooned the budget to such catastrophic proportions. That change also meant marketing took a while to finally roll out, all while trying to compete against bigger and splashier ad campaigns like Avengers and Deadpool. Star Wars fatigue could certainly be a thing with less than six months in between the last two films and following up a very divisive film at that. The main takeaway for me though is there is no damn reason that a spin\-off movie should cost more than a main movie. Solo potentially being one of the most expensive films of all time is insane because by its very nature the work is disposable, an ad on, DLC. It should be a fun addendum, not must see material that demands the kind of massive crowd size reserved for the splashiest of releases.
* **Solo: A Star Wars Story \(cont.\)**  \-   Where Lucasfilm goes from here is going to be very interesting. There's blessedly more space between Solo and Episode IX with a full year and change. The episodes also don't feel as directly threatened. The more curious ones will be the Obi Wan movie by Stephen Daldry and the recently announced Boba Fett movie by James Mangold. The latter director in particular is well known for delivering good earning and audience beloved hit films like Logan on time and under budget which is exactly what Star Wars needs right now. Solo is arguably the biggest single character draw of the franchise and the fact the general public reacted so incredibly ambiguously to Solo should be extremely worrisome for Disney. It shows name alone will not drive sales and it already feels like the other spin\-off movies that are coming are horribly out of date before they even begin principal photography. Disney/Lucasfilm needs to take a real hard look at the future of this Star Wars cinematic universe because I don't think they ever expected to have potentially one of the biggest box office bombs of all time by just their fourth release.

And with variety shows almost a dead art at this point, it’s time The Academy put in charge the one troupe who still know what they’re doing in that arena – The Muppets.

Let The Muppets put on a show for a few hours, let them wreak havoc onstage and off, breaking up the monotomy of forced celebrity pairings with no chemistry and the introduction of the accountants.  The number one complaint from audiences AND the guests is that the show gets dull after the first half an hour.  Imagine Kermit MC-ing the night, interrupted by Animal in the bandstand, or Bunsen and Beaker who’ve made some sort of Oscar cleaning machine.  Imagine if Fozzie came out and did a stand up spot at minute 45, heckled by Statler and Waldorf who would rightfully be in the balconies, commenting on the winners and losers and musical numbers.

Just about a year ago I came across r/PleXPosters and their [Discord](https://discord.gg/NARZqQX) and hopped right in.  After being a part of the community for a little while, I noticed that their Reddit, Discord and Google Drive at the time (ahh the good old days haha) were okay but they needed a better platform to take them to the next level.  That's where [The Poster Database (TPDb)](https://theposterdb.com) comes in.

&#x200B;

The Poster Database is a custom-built platform for all posters lovers worldwide!  We're currently focusing on media items like Collections, Movies, and Shows but we have some rich plans for the future to expand even further and maybe throw some other goodies along the way ;)  With the launch back in August 2019, we've had amazing support from various communities help contribute to the site and bring us to where we are today with over 35K uploaded posters growing!!

&#x200B;

Just to name some of the amazing items we have in store!

* Agents!  Once we get a little more ""behind the curtain magic"" in place, we'll be taking a look at building some agents for various different media platforms (Plex, Emby, JellyFin, etc..)
* Do you like beta?  We do too and love having some people help out making sure the newest additions are sound before being fully released (because of some requirements and other management items, beta is by request for the time being)
* More media data!  From our road map, this month we're working on adding more data that users can upload to (it's a surprise) and with more data calls for more filters right ;)  Those are on the way also!
* Do you hate when a poster is missing or an upload make a set of posters in a style and you want more?  We've been there too and plan on baking poster requests into the site in an easy to use way!

Edit 1: Corrected malformed links

Edit 2: I'm placing this at the top for all users.  We love the support!  The server, on the other hand, hasn't worked this hard trying to serve the amazing content to you all!  With that, you may notice the site go down, access issues, etc.. and I'm truly sorry.  I'm currently working on restoring the service to all of you and hope that everything can smoothen out shortly!  Once I notice that everything is more stable, I'll provide an update :)

Edit 3: Wow!!!! I have to thank all of you for the wonderful support and constructive criticism.  I have gone through a lot and seen some talk; I'll try and reply where and when possible!  Sorry for the lack of replies, with the site down, I focused my attention on it to try and get it back up and running for all of you to enjoy!  One of the measures that I had in place didn't work as designed and the reason for the long wait.  I have to say, I wasn't expecting the amazing responses from all of you wonderful people! (And an amazing shoutout to all who gifted PRO, GOLD, and SILVER -- I really appreciate it :)) You guys were able to bring in an increase of traffic of over 300% to the site which I wasn't expecting at all, let alone the traction that this post had received!!!

After going and reading through a bunch of comments, I have noted multiple additions, feedback, and concerns and will take appropriate action towards them.  One of the main items being copyright and I respect this fully!  I will always act on reported copyright items immediately as I have in the past.  I have not uploaded a single item to the site and all uploads have been from amazing supporters worldwide!  Like I sort of mentioned earlier, if you see work that has been wrongfully credited, violating a copyright claim, or trying to profit in any way from the poster itself (only by linking to the site directly for the infringed item), please either report the item or user and it/they will be handled accordingly. Also, I want to mention that I am not gaining any profit off of any of the posters currently on the site or will be in the future, or have plans to profit off of them.

For all of the users that linked to other sites, mainly impawards, I actually didn't know about the site and am sorry for missing it.  I am aware of other sites that also operate as a poster website and I am to try and be something different and unique!  Sure, the main focus currently is on media posters, but I plan in the future to go and expand beyond media posters!  To all the users asking about music, concert, books, and so much more, I hear you and I plan on working to incorporate those into the site!  Sure IMDb, TMDb, and TVDb exist and support posters but I see their main focus being on the meta that they provide with the posters being a complement to the service that they offer.  We don't plan on making TPDb another metadata service but rather a site dedicated to Posters of all kinds with amazing features that other sites don't bring to the table.  I know the site was down yesterday and again I'm super sorry about that, but we have a [Road Map](https://theposterdb.com/road-map) that currently lists Q1 of 2020 and our plans during this time but this just touches the surface of where we would love to take this project and what it supports.  As time goes on, support for more meta and features will be updated on the Road Map and even in some cases, thrown in as a surprise!

For some who may not know the background, this project helped curate a platform for posters mainly for future support in Media Server like r/PleX, r/kodi, r/emby, r/jellyfin, and others with an API and agents planned for the media servers planned for April of this year!  This is just one aspect of the platform and we wish to extend it much further than that!

Again, I really apologize for the downtime yesterday and it helped sort out some of the flaws in our current setup.  Going forward and with this amazing support, we know to plan better for the future and at the same time, hope that we can keep the platform up for all of you to enjoy! :)"

e0r2hi,movies,"Be honest: do you want a new TRON movie because you want a new TRON movie, or because you want a new Daft Punk record?","I see a lot of buzz here surrounding *TRON: Legacy*, and the two things I see most often when discussing it are the effects and the score, but also how much people want a third movie with Daft Punk back to do the score.

This leads me to ask: do you want another *TRON* movie because you want a new installment in this story and to see this world again, or if Daft Punk put out 1 or 2 more albums, would you be content with that instead? What about both?

Just a thought I've had for a while, because I myself am very passionate about *TRON* and would love a third movie; unfortunately, because Disney remixed the robots' compositions without their permission, they may not be back."

gxsdnc,movies,Top Gun is a bad movie and Maverick is a bad pilot and shit human being.,"Let's just set aside the theme of 'Merica the best for a second.  Maverick (Tom Cruise) is a horrible person in general, him and his RIO/Best friend (Anthony Edwards) are not even the best team in the squadron.  They get the honorable mention to TOP GUN school because Maverick abandons his wing mate and decides to 1v1 me IRL instead of covering the lead plane.  Ironically this is the only lesson learns in the entire movie but not without making the same mistake once more in his flight vs Viper and Jester.

Maverick (probably picked his own callsign) routinely gets rewarded or excused for bad decision making throughout his career that would have had any one incident tossed out of the NAVY.   High speed passes over an air traffic controller tower over active runways is probably the dumbest things an aviator can do.   The air traffic controller is GOD as far as you are concerned as a pilot.  Arranging landing and take off patterns is complex enough without some dipshit flying 400 mph 300ft off the ground.   Fuck it, let's do it twice for the lols

Maverick gets excused for the accident that killed his best friend.  I can only imagine he is found not at fault due to those on the court martial panel remembering/serving with Mavericks dad.   He is 100% at fault for being in a bad position trying to steal points AND pulling nose up during an engine failure causing an unrecoverable flat spin.  

While we're on it, HOW the fuck does he have Goose's dog tags over his widow or their kid, then yeets it into the ocean?

Finally earn that date with the new hottie you've been chasing through the women's bathroom?  Let's go play beach volleyball in JEANS and sunglasses before hand.   Great idea MAV!   After you show up reeking of dead fish and sweat wrapped in a leather jacket you can just excuse yourself and shower at her place...

Iceman (Val Kilmer) is 100% correct in his assessment of Maverick, he is unsafe, dangerous and is just as likely to get you killed as he is to save you.

Did we mention that he abandons Iceman to a 6 to 1 dogfight?


Also Mighty wings is a better song than Dangerzone."

65nqfd,movies,Not watching trailers made movies significantly better,"I don't know if this was posted somewhere before, but years ago I decided to not watch trailers specifically because they were ruining movies for me one way or another. Growing up trailers were my favorite thing. I loved being hyped for a movie to come out. However, numerous times trailers have spoilers for movies coming out. Even if the trailer doesn't have a ""spoiler"" it can have a scene from the end of the movie that you're waiting for that can count as a spoiler. An example without trying to do a spoiler in an actual movie is that you see a character from the movie that does something you haven't seen yet, but they just had a scene where they are supposed to be dead and now you know they aren't because they haven't done the scene from the trailer yet. 


Spoilers aside a lot of times people who do the trailer portray the movie incorrectly then how you do once you watch the movie. This causes you to go into the movie with a preconceived notion that the movie is about X and really it's about Y, but thinking it was about X makes you not enjoy the movie. A good example of this, for me personally and all my friends, was watchmen. That was one of the last trailers I watched and without having read the comics just judging by the trailer I thought it was going to be non stop action. 


After only watching movies based on titles/actors/posters it has dramatically increased my movie watching experience. You let the movie tell you the story without trying to make it fit your mindset of what it should be based on the trailer. Also, try to avoid reviews. A lot of reviews are from people who don't have the same likes and dislikes as you, but thinking a movie sucks because you read a bunch of people hating it can make you try to focus on all the negatives on the movie. 

tl;dr Try watching movies without seeing an reviews or trailers on it. You'll likely enjoy it much more."

However recently there has been an even greater shift as Hollywood is trying to pretend that every film released is a great charitable service rather than just trying to make money.
I recently saw an interview with Oprah Winfrey for A Wrinkle in Time and it is sickening how many of the world's injustices they claim to be fixing.  For reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9jknmSBsMc 
It's a great book and might even be a great movie but promoting it like this is nauseating. Disney did not spend $103 million on this film to better mankind. They did it for profit. 
I really wish they'd stop patting themselves on the back and acting so altruistic as a marketing tool for such a money hungry enterprise. Particularly in light of it being a direct response to their own sordid industry.

fngiyv,movies,Rant- Dear youtubers/bloggers: a review is NOT summarising every detail of the plot and making the odd observation,"I am getting so sick and tired of this, it used to be a youtube problem but now it's spreading to blogs and even review sites like denofgeek. Basically the typical youtube ""review"" is about 20mins long and consists of the host describing the entire plot from start to finish and often garnishing this with a few clips if it's an older movie. It's basically like watching MST3K or Elvira but instead of getting to watch the movie they just tell you what's happening and make a few comments. Then the only thing that is actually a review is about 30 seconds at the end where they say if they think it's good or bad. So in general there is no point watching a youtube ""review"" unless you have either seen the movie already or have no intention of watching it and just want to watch someone tell you what happens. The weird thing is that they're insanely popular- apparently millions of people want to watch a random person on a couch telling them what happens in a movie without watching it. I'm not saying all youtubers are like this- most who cover brand new releases like Chris Stuckmann or Jeremy Jahns do a really good job giving a concise non-spoilery review. 

This is spreading onto review sites as well. I was reading denofgeek the other day for a review of an individual episode and it was literally a summary of what happened and then a small paragraph at the bottom saying that they liked it. Now they have started giving spoiler warnings on some shows like Dr Who but the ""review"" before the spoiler warning is basically saying how they can't/don't know how to review it without giving spoilers."

The cast is marvelous. The beautiful Keira Knightley (only 17 when this was shot) is a perfect leading lady, Depp's iconic creation of Jack Sparrow carries the movie, Bloom's principled pretty boy Will Turner is a hilarious counter to Depp, and an astonishingly good host of side characters fulfill their roles perfectly.


I could praise everything else; the set design, costuming, direction, special effects, script and score endlessly, but it'll have to suffice to merely say that the cooperative world-building is impeccable.


In the best way, The Curse of the Black Pearl feels like the ride that inspired it. Richly detailed, blissfully escapist and consistently compelling, I'll never understand how Verbinski and crew were able to maintain that for this entire two and a half hour movie.
But despite the aggressive plotting, this thing never runs out of gas. 

Through all the shifting character allegiances, evolving identities and various twists and turns along the way, you never lose sight of what's happening. It's a blockbuster equipped with a rare clarity and confidence, a total masterpiece that feels driven by a singularly creative and adventurous spirit."

48vbql,movies,"I just realized that ""Men in Black"" is one of the very, very few fantasy/adventure movies where a character is not motivated by the death of a loved one or some kind of divine prophecy. Will Smith was chosen simply because he was a good applicant, and joined because it was the right thing to do.","Just think about it. Almost all blockbusters use the orphan trope or the chosen one trope. A lot of the time they use both. MIB did neither.

Will Smith was not picked because he was a chosen one prophesied to defend earth against the aliens. He didn't decide to say yes because some inspirational quote his dead brother told him instilled a certain set of values in him. He was offered a chance because he was a good cop. They picked him because he showed the most skill in their testing scenarios. And he joined because he wanted to. 

In fact, after three movies we still know next to nothing about their lives before joining. J was a cop. That's literally all we know. In the third we found out he grew up without a dad, but it had zero relevance to the story until the third one and wasn't his motivation. In the first one, all of his characterization was purely based around his personality and interaction with others, his backstory was completely nonexistent. 

K had a wife. That's the extent of his backstory even after three movies. 


Isn't this kinda cool, when you really think about it? It's way less cliche, and prophecies are now so overused that they no longer carry weight. And the fact that we bonded with the characters so much, purely based on their personalities, just shows how great the writing and acting was. It feels cheap to get an audience to connect with someone using the death of other characters or some kind of other complicated backstory. 

I guarantee if you put the story in less competent hands they would have done all this. 

EDIT: All you people asking if I've seen the third one obviously read nothing past the title lmao. 

EDIT 2: ALSO, as many have pointed out, his mind was wiped and therefore had no recollection of his dad's death. So that couldn't have affected his decisions. You could argue that it influenced K to select him, but the movie never outright said this.

EDIT 3: This is specifically talking about fantasy/adventure/blockbuster movies. I'm aware not every movie ever made follows these tropes, lord. 

EDIT 4: Huh, gilded. Neat. Thanks whoever you are. I now have as many oscars as Leo. "

7jsyqt,announcements,"The FCC’s vote was predictably frustrating, but we’re not done fighting for net neutrality.","Following today’s disappointing vote from the FCC, Alexis and I wanted to take the time to thank redditors for your incredible activism on this issue, and reassure you that we’re going to continue fighting for the free and open internet. 

Over the past few months, we have been floored by the energy and creativity redditors have displayed in the effort to save net neutrality. It was inspiring to witness [organic takeovers](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/7j8fkt/an_analysis_of_net_neutrality_activism_on_reddit/) of the front page \(twice\), read touching [stories](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/6mtgtp/we_need_your_voice_as_we_continue_the_fight_for/) about how net neutrality matters in users’ everyday lives, see bills about net neutrality [discussed on the front page](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/7j6kn4/congress_has_set_out_a_bill_to_stop_the_fcc/) \(with over 100,000 upvotes and cross-posts to over 100 communities\), and watch redditors exercise their voices as citizens in the [hundreds of thousands of calls](https://thenextweb.com/insider/2017/11/22/reddit-net-neutrality-fcc-protest/) they drove to Congress.

It is disappointing that the FCC Chairman plowed ahead with his planned repeal despite all of this [public concern](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/12/12/this-poll-gave-americans-a-detailed-case-for-and-against-the-fccs-net-neutrality-plan-the-reaction-among-republicans-was-striking/?hpid=hp_hp-cards_hp-card-technology%3Ahomepage%2Fcard&utm_term=.d11780a12cc2), not to mention the [objections expressed by his fellow commissioners](https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/12/16766324/fcc-commissioners-clyburn-rosenworcel-net-neutrality), [the FCC’s own CTO](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/13/net-neutrality-repeal-warning-eric-burger-fcc-259968), [more than a hundred members of Congress](https://doyle.house.gov/sites/doyle.house.gov/files/documents/20171213DoyleNDelayLtrAll.pdf), [dozens of senators, and the very builders of the modern internet](https://www.salon.com/2017/12/12/senators-internet-pioneers-pen-letters-to-fcc-asking-to-cancel-thursdays-net-neutrality-vote/). 

Nevertheless, today’s vote is the beginning, not the end. While the fight to preserve net neutrality is going to be longer than we had hoped, this is far from over.

Many of you have asked what comes next. We don’t exactly know yet, but it seems likely that the FCC’s decision will be challenged in court soon, and we would be supportive of that challenge. It’s also possible that Congress can decide to take up the cause and create strong, enforceable net neutrality rules that aren’t subject to the political winds at the FCC. Nevertheless, this will be a complex process that takes time.

What is certain is that Reddit will continue to be involved in this issue in the way that we know best: seeking out every opportunity to amplify your voices and share them with those who have the power to make a difference. 

This isn’t the outcome we wanted, but you should all be proud of the awareness you’ve created. Those who thought that they’d be able to quietly repeal net neutrality without anyone noticing or caring learned a thing or two, and we still may come out on top of this yet. We’ll keep you informed as things develop.

u\/arabscarab \(Jessica, our head of policy\) will also be in the comments to address your questions. 

—u\/spez & u\/kn0thing

update: Please note the FCC is not united in this decision and find the dissenting statements from commissioners [Clyburn and Rosenworcel](https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/14/16776712/fcc-commissioners-democrat-statements-net-neutrality).

update2 (9:55AM pst): While the vote has not technically happened, we decided to post after the two dissenting commissioners released their statements. However, the actual vote appears to be delayed for security reasons. We hope everyone is safe.

update3 (10:13AM pst): The FCC votes to repeal 3–2."

Today, [the US Senate voted 52\-47](https://www.wired.com/story/senate-approves-measure-to-save-net-neutrality) to restore Net Neutrality! While this measure must now go through the House of Representatives and then the White House in order for the rules to be fully restored, this is still an incredibly important step in that process—one that could not have happened without all your phone calls, emails, and [other activism](https://redditblog.com/2017/12/11/an-analysis-of-net-neutrality-activism-on-reddit/). The [evidence](http://www.publicconsultation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Net_Neutrality_II_Slides_041818.pdf) is clear that Net Neutrality is important to Americans of both parties \(or no party at all\), and today’s vote demonstrated that our Senators are hearing us.

We’ve still got a way to go, but today’s vote has provided us with some incredible momentum and energy to keep fighting. 

We’re going to keep working with you all on this in the coming months, but for now, we just wanted to say thanks!"

Edit 1: Spelt Rey wrong sorry! Autocorrect and I didn't check.

Edit 2: Thank you so very much for the support that this post has received, it really has been quite overwhelming. This post is very much a quick outpouring of thoughts of mine rather then a well thought through argument focusing on the main issues with EA's Star Wars Battlefront 2. I only eluded to the main issues, rather than outright stating the unacceptable issues with loot boxes, progression grind, the pay to win aspects and the short campaign etc. However people who are on this sub reddit are very much aware of the main issues.

All I hope that this post has managed to bring attention to the main issues and bring about some positive change.

Instead, all I did was apologize and ask if we could reschedule. That's it, one sentence, no additional information, no explanation or excuse as to why I missed the first interview. 

They replied within 20 minutes, apologizing to ME, saying it was probably their fault, that they'd been having trouble with their computer system for days, and of course I could reschedule, was I available that afternoon?

Don't ever volunteer information, kids. You never know what information the other party has, and you can always give information if asked for it later.

80jsi9,announcements,Upvote the Downvote: Tell Congress to use the CRA to save net neutrality!,"Hey, Reddit! 

It’s been a couple months since the FCC voted to repeal federal net neutrality regulations. We were all disappointed in the decision, but we told you we’d continue the fight, and we wanted to share an update on what you can do to help. 

The debate has now moved to Congress, which is good news. Unlike the FCC, which is unelected and less immediately accountable to voters, members of Congress depend on input from their constituents to help inform their positions—especially during an election year like this one. 

“But wait,” you say. “I already called my Congressperson last year, and we’re still in this mess! What’s different now?” Three words: **Congressional Review Act.**

# What is it?

The Congressional Review Act \(CRA\) is basically Congress’s downvote. It lets them undo the FCC’s order through a “resolution of disapproval.” This can be formally introduced in both the Senate and the House within 60 legislative days after the FCC’s order is officially published in the Federal Register, which happened last week. It needs a simple majority in both houses to pass. Our friends at Public Knowledge have made [a video explaining the process](https://youtu.be/VABCjxFtRnI).

# What’s happening in Congress?

Now that the FCC order has been published in the Federal Register, the clock for the CRA is ticking. Members of both the House and Senate who care about Net Neutrality have already been securing the votes they need to pass the resolution of disapproval. In fact, the Senate version is only [**#onemorevote**](https://www.battleforthenet.com/onemorevote/) away from the 51 it needs to pass! 

# What should I do?

Today, we’re calling on you to phone your members of Congress and tell them what you think! You can see exactly where members stand on this issue so far on [this scoreboard](https://www.battleforthenet.com/scoreboard/). If they’re already on board with the CRA, great! Thank them for their efforts and tell them you appreciate it. Positive feedback for good work is important.

If they still need convincing, here is a script to help guide your conversation:

“My name is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and I live in \_\_\_\_\_\_. I’m calling today to share my support for strong net neutrality rules. I’d like to ask Senator/Representative\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ to use the CRA to pass a resolution of disapproval overturning the FCC’s repeal of net neutrality.”

# Pro tips:

\-**Be polite**. That thing your grandma said about the flies and the honey and the vinegar is right. Remember, the people who disagree with us are the ones we need to convince. 

\-**Only call the Senators and Representatives who actually represent YOU**. Calls are most effective when they come from actual constituents. If you’re not sure who represents you or how to get in touch with them, you can look it up [here](https://www.publicknowledge.org/act-now/tell-congress-to-use-the-cra-to-save-net-neutrality/#anchor).

\-**If this issue affects you personally because of who you are or what you do, let them know!** Local business owner who uses the web to reach customers? Caregiver who uses telemedicine to consult patients? Parent whose child needs the internet for school assignments? Share that. The more we can put a human face on this, the better.

\-**Don’t give up.** The nature of our democratic system means that things can be roundabout, messy, and take a long time to accomplish. Perseverance is key. We’ll be with you every step of the way."

ktfej3,WhitePeopleTwitter,The Choice Is Clear,
a99fw9,tifu,TIFU by buying everyone an AncestryDNA kit and ruining Christmas,"Earlier this year, AncestryDNA had a sale on their kit. I thought it would be a great gift idea so I bought 6 of them for Christmas presents. Today my family got together to exchange presents for our Christmas Eve tradition, and I gave my mom, dad, brother, and 2 sisters each a kit. 

As soon as everyone opened their gift at the same time, my mom started freaking out. She told us how she didn’t want us taking them because they had unsafe chemicals. We explained to her how there were actually no chemicals, but we could tell she was still flustered. Later she started trying to convince us that only one of us kids need to take it since we will all have the same results and to resell extra kits to save money. 

Fast forward: Our parents have been fighting upstairs for the past hour, and we are downstairs trying to figure out who has a different dad. 

TL;DR I bought everyone in my family AncestryDNA kit for Christmas. My mom started freaking. Now our parents are fighting and my dad might not be my dad. 

Update:  Thank you so much for all the love and support. My sisters, brother and I have not yet decided yet if we are going to take the test. No matter what the results are, we will still love each other, and our parents no matter what. 

Update 2: CHRISTMAS ISN’T RUINED! My FU actually turned into a Christmas miracle. Turns out my sisters father passed away shortly after she was born. A good friend of my moms was able to help her through the darkest time in her life, and they went on to fall in love and create the rest of our family. They never told us because of how hard it was for my mom. Last night she was strong enough to share stories and photos with us for the first time, and it truly brought us even closer together as a family. This is a Christmas we will never forget. And yes, we are all excited to get our test results. Merry Christmas everyone!

P.S. Sorry my mom isn’t a whore. No you’re not my daddy. "

*I am a veteran playing Battlefield since 2002, using origin since launch and one of the founders of India's oldest and largest Battlefield Community (*[*http://Battlefield.community*](http://Battlefield.community) *or* [*http://battlefieldindia.com*](http://battlefieldindia.com) *)*

[Battlefield India Community \(since 2007\)](https://preview.redd.it/8hewmprcl9261.png?width=256&format=png&auto=webp&s=f84af19e1f0d98945181cd1e190df2960b4edfe0)

Just two weeks back I wasn't able to login to my Origin Account (with Battlefield 5 Pre-ordered). I contacted EA Help and they are telling there there is no trace of my ID. I provided them my transaction IDs, Order IDs, Game Keys, But they are telling that they have no info. In fact they don't even know what happened. EA Help mercilessly disconnected the conversation with vague explanations.

My account has games worth thousands of Dollars which includes BF1942, BF1 Premium, BFBC2, BF3 premium, BF4 Premium, BF5 (pre-ordered), Unravel 1, Unravel 2, TitalFall 2, Battlefront 1, FIFA 18, Medal of Honor, etc.

I even went to call them but they said that they can't do anything and don't know anything. Everything gone! but more surprising is that EA isn't even telling me what happened. They told me it's not their responsibility.

When i search in Battlelog and origin I still get my profile.

(The DP is my real picture from my days in Indian Air Force - Served for 10 years)

# Update: Final Response from EA : ""We don't know anything about your account""

^(Himanshu: I told you that there is no such   information about ""\*\*\*@live.in"")

^(you: ok what next??)

^(you: i want my games back, I have the receipts,   the credit card transactions, everything)

^(you: how to get them backHimanshu: There is no account.)

^(Himanshu: There is no details.)

^(Himanshu: So I am unable to follow any process for   you.)

^(you: but how is it my fault...??? EA should be   able to get me back what I purchased\*\*...)

^(Himanshu: The deletion request was requested from   your side.)

^(you: Atleast show me the acknowledgement   evidence that someone who knows me requested for deletion of my account.. I   don't even have any emails on this)

^(Himanshu: How should I provide you any information ?)

^(Himanshu: There is no account.)

^(Himanshu: There is no case.)

^(Himanshu: There are no such information.)

^(Himanshu: There are nothing.)

^(you: But that is EA's thing to keep.. how can i   know if someone did it... and how can someone do it without having access to   my email id and my mobile phone.. while 2FA was active)

^(you: I have receipts so atleast give me my games   back and get me a new account)

^(Himanshu: There is no way to verify your proof of   purchase.)

^(Himanshu: We are unable to fetch any information by   your game codes.you: nowhy?? i have transaction IDs, I still   have that credit card, i have receipts, i have the same phone no, same email  \*\* id)

^(you: why can't it be verified)

^(Himanshu: Because all your details were on your   account.)

^(Himanshu: And now there is no account.)

^(Himanshu: So how can we verify you and your purchases \*\*  ?)

^(you: But my bank has the transaction IDs that i   paid to EA... your billing team will have that)

^(you: the way you want...you: i have access to everything related to this   account except for the account itself that is on a portal managed by you)

^(Himanshu: I checked your previous case.)

^(Himanshu: We consulted with the billing team.Himanshu: We don't have any information.)

^(Himanshu: So we are unable to verify you and your   purchases.you: so what is your final call on this?)

^(Himanshu: If you want a call back service.you: yes i do)

^(Himanshu: I can generate a call back service for you.)

^(\*Himanshu: Please share your number. you: my no is +91\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*)

^(Himanshu: Thank you.Himanshu: Now please cancel the browser\*\*.)

^(Himanshu: You will receive a call from our side   within 3-4 hours.you: can you tell me what is the resolution to   this from your end and what is the take away from this tiresome converstaion?)

^(Himanshu: I tried all the possible ways for you.)

^(Himanshu: But when there is no account I was unable   to locate\*\* anything\*\*.)

^(Himanshu: I will generate a call back service for \*\*  you.)

^(you: wthe take away is it is not reliable to buy   anything on Origin as anytime it can be deleted and EA will blindly tell it   was deleted and would give no evidence of it)

^(Himanshu: So you can receive \*\* a call support\*\*.)

^(Himanshu: If we deleted your account that means   account deletion was requested\*\* from your side.)

^(you: but you didn't give any proof or any mail   from my id that requested it??)

^(you: how can you claim that i requested it)

^(you: that is really lame)

^(Himanshu: How can you expect any information ?)

^(Himanshu: When there is no account\*\* anymore.)

^(Himanshu: Everything is linked to your account.)

^(Himanshu: Okay.)

^(you: and my account was deleted by EA so ??????   what are you trying\*\* to suggest????)

^(Himanshu:\*\* We never do that.)

^(you: can't you yourself see that these are all   vague arguments.. just going in circles)

^(Himanshu: Request\*\* was from your side.you\*\*: prove it)

^(you: provide email that came from my id for   deleting this account)

^(you: where is acknowledgement from my end)

^(you: ??)

^(Himanshu: Could you please prove it the deletion request \*\*  was not from your side ?)

^(you: Yes i can... as there is no case ID nor any\*\*  \*\* email that I sent)

^(you: there is nothing related to deletion in my   mail box...)

^(Himanshu: Just like you I can prove that we didn't   delete y\*\*our account from our\*\*\*\* sid\*\*e.)

^(you: wow....)

^(you: thanks)

# Update 1 : EA just deleted my only case ID and now I have nowhere to track the details of my conversation

[https://i.redd.it/xvobr5makjf11.jpg](https://i.redd.it/xvobr5makjf11.jpg)

My case ID has been deleted by EA. I have tweeted this to Battlefield & DICE already. As of now I have no way to even track this and have been asked to wait. Atleast they considered taking a look.

[https://twitter.com/FlyingOffr](https://twitter.com/FlyingOffr)[/status/1028218856605536257](https://twitter.com/FlyingOffr/status/1028218856605536257)

# Update 2: 

Reddit Mod has removed my post. not sure why

# Update 3: 

Reddit Mod restored my post.

# Update 4:

 I have provided my credit card details (last 6 digits) to EA although it seems they have no clue about my account. At this stage I have lost all hopes on getting this back. Waiting for an update.

# Update 5: 

Sarah from EA has told me that they have failed to get any details related to my account and have asked me to create a new Origin account for which they will add Battlefield games. Not sure about other games so far. I have collated the Order IDs, Game keys (as much as possible) and last 6 digits of my credit cards and waiting for update. So far the response from EA has been really cold and I am getting repeated and vague questions in emails again and again even when I provided all these details long back.

# Update 6: 

I am continuously trying to reach EA using various channels (including Sarah's mail ID) but I am getting no response. They have made me create a new ID and assured to provide me everything back but I still haven't got all of my games (including Battlefield 5 Pre-Order) and my soldier name i.e. FlyingOfficer.

# Update 7:  

I have got a response from EA just minutes ago and they are working on something although what they are offering is not what I want.  All I want is my games that I paid for (I have valid bank transaction IDs) and my soldier name i.e. ""FlyingOfficer"".  I will update once they confirm me on this. So far on a higher level they have told me that ""We cannot assure anything at this moment"".

# Update 8: 

Sarah from EA has helped me in getting my soldier ID back (FlyingOfficer) and added most of all the games (Except for Battlefield V Pre-Order) into my new account. She has also provided me 12 months of free Origin Premier membership ( I didn't ask for this). Although my stats history is gone I am quite satisfied that I got my soldier ID back. Waiting for them to restore my Battlefield V Pre-Order.

[https://i.redd.it/764limsw8pf11.jpg](https://i.redd.it/764limsw8pf11.jpg)

# Update 9: 

Battlefield 5 Pre-Order has been restored into my Origin Account.

# Update 10: 

My Battlefield 1 Stats have been restored.

**LETTER OF THANKS**:

**A big thanks to the gaming community who came in hordes to support me (brings tears in my eyes, literally)** while all doors were closed for me and EA Help shamelessly rejected my support requests. Had I not got this much of support, I don't think I would have ever thought of going back to Battlefield.>>Having said that **I want to strongly back the developers (i.e. DICE) of Battlefield and the Franchise itself as they have delivered to us some of the best First Person Shooters in last 15 years.** This incident and events that have unfolded thereafter (including the immense support from the good guys in this world) will be an unforgettable experience for me and **my support and enthusiasm for Battlefield 5 the future releases will be the same as ever**. For the game and the developer Studio DICE, I have only accolades and I have always wanted this franchise to win the competition. Although when it comes to Electronic Arts. I do have a lot of complaints and won't stop criticizing it for being so money hungry and pathetic (especially User Support and Business Strategies). I wish DICE wasn't associated with EA but that is far from getting real. **I request all of you to not lose your trust in Battlefield and the developers who have put their heart and soul in bringing Battlefield to us.**\>>The key takeaway is that none of us should remain silent when mammoths in the industry try to suppress us and we should give corrupt people a strong fight. If EA doesn't know how to treat us then let's teach them, all together. Let's make videos and post which highlight the security and data retention flaws of EA.>>Thanks,>>(Samarjit Roy Choudhury)>>Origin ID: FlyingOfficer>>Thanks to YouTubers, [Drop Rate](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRJsZ5d8QdIvaoxCNV9KyLg), [SidAlpha](https://www.youtube.com/user/GreyWolf779) & [ReviewTechUSA](https://www.youtube.com/user/ReviewTechUSA) for making videos on this issue:>>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5zPyD0SA0Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5zPyD0SA0Y)\>>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uu67uPlezCs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uu67uPlezCs)\>>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ls64hxpqt\_E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ls64hxpqt_E)

7ekwu9,Music,The FCC is about to kill net neutrality. We’re protesting nationwide on Dec 7th to stop them.,"**tldr: The FCC is about to kill net neutrality. We’re protesting nationwide on Dec 7th to stop them.
Head over to http://www.verizonprotests.com/ for more info.**

**WHAT’S HAPPENING?**
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) just [announced](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20171120/11253438653/fcc-plan-to-use-thanksgiving-to-hide-attack-net-neutrality-vastly-underestimates-looming-backlash.shtml) its plan to slash net neutrality rules, allowing ISPs like Verizon to block apps, slow websites, and charge fees to control what you see & do online. They vote December 14th. People from across the political spectrum are outraged, so we’re planning to protest at Verizon retail stores across the country on December 7, one week before the vote and at the peak of the busy Holiday shopping season. We'll demand that our members of Congress take action to stop Verizon's puppet FCC from killing net neutrality.

**WHAT’S NET NEUTRALITY?**
Net neutrality is the [basic principle](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/05/the-case-for-rebooting-the-network-neutrality-debate/361809/) that has made the Internet into what it is today. It prevents big Internet Service Providers (like Verizon) from charging extra fees, engaging in censorship, or controlling what we see and do on the web by throttling websites, apps, and online services.

**WHY VERIZON STORES?**
The new chairman of the FCC, Ajit Pai, is a former top lawyer for Verizon, and the company has been spending millions on [lobbying](https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/12/15959932/comcast-verizon-att-net-neutrality-day-of-action) and lawsuits to kill net neutrality so they can gauge us all for more money. By protesting at Verizon stores, we’re shining light on the corruption and demanding that our local do something about it. Only Congress has the power to stop Verizon's puppet FCC, so at the protests we'll be calling and tweeting at legislators, and in cities where it's possible we'll march from Verizon stores to lawmakers offices.

**WHAT ARE OUR DEMANDS?**
Ajit Pai is clearly still working for Verizon, not the public. But he still has to answer to Congress. So we’re calling on our lawmakers to do their job overseeing the FCC and speak out against Ajit Pai’s plan to gut Title II net neutrality protections and give Verizon and other giant ISPs everything on their holiday wishlist. 

**HOW CAN I JOIN?**
[Click here](https://events.battleforthenet.com/#eventType=protestrally) and you’ll find an interactive map where you can see if there is already a protest planned near you. If not, you can [sign up to host one](http://act.demandprogress.org/event/team-internet/create/), and we’ll send you materials to make it easy and help you recruit others in your area. These protests will be quick, fun, and 100% legal. If you can’t attend a protest on December 7th, you can still help defend net neutrality by [calling your lawmakers](http://battleforthenet.com/) and spreading the word on social media. You can also sign up to host a meeting with your members of Congress, or volunteer for our texting team to help turn people out for these protests."

I vividly remember the enormous repercussions that the reckless actions by those on Wall Street had in my personal life, and the lives of those close to me. I was fortunate - my parents were prudent and a little paranoid, and they had some food storage saved up. When that crisis hit our family, we were able to keep our little house, but we lived off of pancake mix, and powdered milk, and beans and rice for a year. Ever since then, my parents have kept a food storage, and they keep it updated and fresh.

Those close to me, my friends and extended family, were not nearly as fortunate. My aunt moved in with us and paid what little rent she could to my family while she tried to find any sort of work. Do you know what tomato soup made out of school cafeteria ketchup packets taste like? My friends got to find out. Almost a year after the crisis' low, my dad had stabilized our income stream and to help out others, he was hiring my friends' dads for odd house work. One of them built a new closet in our guest room. Another one did some landscaping in our backyard. I will forever be so proud of my parents, because in a time of need, even when I have no doubt money was still tight, they had the mindfulness and compassion to help out those who absolutely needed it.

To Melvin Capital: you stand for everything that I hated during that time. You're a firm who makes money off of exploiting a company and manipulating markets and media to your advantage. Your continued existence is a sharp reminder that the ones in charge of so much hardship during the '08 crisis were not punished. And your blatant disregard for the law, made obvious months ago through your (for the Melvin lawyers out there: alleged) illegal naked short selling and more recently your obscene market manipulation after hours shows that you haven't learned a single thing since '08. And why would you? Your ilk were bailed out and rewarded for terrible and illegal financial decisions that negatively changed the lives of millions. I bought shares a few days ago. I dumped my savings into GME, paid my rent for this month with my credit card, and dumped my rent money into more GME (which for the people here at WSB, I would not recommend). And I'm holding. This is personal for me, and millions of others. You can drop the price of GME after hours $120, I'm not going anywhere. You can pay for thousands of reddit bots, I'm holding. You can get every mainstream media outlet to demonize us, I don't care. I'm making this as painful as I can for you.

To CNBC: you must realize your short term gains through promoting institutions' agenda is just that - short term. Your staple audience will soon become too old to care, and the millions of us, not just at WSB but every person affected by the '08 crash that's now paying attention to GME, are going to remember how you stuck up for the firms that ruined so many of us, and tried to tear down the little guys. I know for sure I'll remember this. In response, here is a [list of CNBC sponsors and partners](https://www.cnbcevents.com/sponsors/). They include, but are not limited to, **IBM**, **Cisco**, **TMobile**, **JPMorgan**, **Oracle**, and **ZipRecruiter**. Their parent company is [NBCUniversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBCUniversal), owned by **Comcast** and **GE**.

To the boomers, and/or people close to that age, just now paying attention to these ""millennial blog posts"": you realize that, even if you weren't adversely effected by the '08 crash, your children and perhaps grandchildren most likely were? *We're not enemies, we're on the same side*. Stop listening to the media that's making us out to be market destroyers, and start rooting for us, because we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to punish the sort of people who caused so much pain and stress a decade ago, and we're taking that opportunity. Your children, your grandchildren, might have suffered as I described because of the institutions that we're fighting against. You really want to choose them, over your own family and friends? We're not asking you to risk your 401k or retirement fund on a single GME bet. We're just asking you to be understanding, supportive, and to not support the people that caused so much suffering a decade ago.

To WSB: you all are amazing. I imagine that I'm not the only one that this is personal for. I've read myself so many posts on what you guys went through during the '08 crash. Whether you're here for the gains, to stick it to the man as I am, or just to be part of a potentially market changing movement - thank you. Each and every one of you are the reason that we have this chance. I've never felt this optimistic about the future before. This is life changing amounts of money for so many of you, and to be part of a rare instance of a wealth distribution from the rich to the poor is just incredible. I love you all.

He killed off the Jedi until there were only 2 Jedi and 2 Sith, so balanced in a way. Or, in a different interpretation, this action distabilized the Force since the Sith had more control over the universe. The action that brought balance to the Force was when he, as Vader, killed Palpatine. As u/Sarahneth mentioned, he also brought balance to his pod racer as well, if we're being very literal."

7ekx19,listentothis,The FCC is about to kill net neutrality. We’re protesting nationwide on Dec 7th to stop them.,"**tldr: The FCC is about to kill net neutrality. We’re protesting nationwide on Dec 7th to stop them.
Head over to http://www.verizonprotests.com/ for more info.**

**WHAT’S HAPPENING?**
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) just [announced](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20171120/11253438653/fcc-plan-to-use-thanksgiving-to-hide-attack-net-neutrality-vastly-underestimates-looming-backlash.shtml) its plan to slash net neutrality rules, allowing ISPs like Verizon to block apps, slow websites, and charge fees to control what you see & do online. They vote December 14th. People from across the political spectrum are outraged, so we’re planning to protest at Verizon retail stores across the country on December 7, one week before the vote and at the peak of the busy Holiday shopping season. We'll demand that our members of Congress take action to stop Verizon's puppet FCC from killing net neutrality.

**WHAT’S NET NEUTRALITY?**
Net neutrality is the [basic principle](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/05/the-case-for-rebooting-the-network-neutrality-debate/361809/) that has made the Internet into what it is today. It prevents big Internet Service Providers (like Verizon) from charging extra fees, engaging in censorship, or controlling what we see and do on the web by throttling websites, apps, and online services.

**WHY VERIZON STORES?**
The new chairman of the FCC, Ajit Pai, is a former top lawyer for Verizon, and the company has been spending millions on [lobbying](https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/12/15959932/comcast-verizon-att-net-neutrality-day-of-action) and lawsuits to kill net neutrality so they can gauge us all for more money. By protesting at Verizon stores, we’re shining light on the corruption and demanding that our local do something about it. Only Congress has the power to stop Verizon's puppet FCC, so at the protests we'll be calling and tweeting at legislators, and in cities where it's possible we'll march from Verizon stores to lawmakers offices.

**WHAT ARE OUR DEMANDS?**
Ajit Pai is clearly still working for Verizon, not the public. But he still has to answer to Congress. So we’re calling on our lawmakers to do their job overseeing the FCC and speak out against Ajit Pai’s plan to gut Title II net neutrality protections and give Verizon and other giant ISPs everything on their holiday wishlist. 

**HOW CAN I JOIN?**
[Click here](https://events.battleforthenet.com/#eventType=protestrally) and you’ll find an interactive map where you can see if there is already a protest planned near you. If not, you can [sign up to host one](http://act.demandprogress.org/event/team-internet/create/), and we’ll send you materials to make it easy and help you recruit others in your area. These protests will be quick, fun, and 100% legal. If you can’t attend a protest on December 7th, you can still help defend net neutrality by [calling your lawmakers](http://battleforthenet.com/) and spreading the word on social media. You can also sign up to host a meeting with your members of Congress, or volunteer for our texting team to help turn people out for these protests."

ak2k64,tifu,TIFU by living in a dark bedroom for 6 years.,"The overhead fan in our bedroom uses one of those compact halogen light bulbs. 

6 years ago the bulb burned out and got really dim, just barely a glow. I bought a replacement bulb but when I put that one in it was also barely lighting up so I realized the unit was bad.  

The fan still worked GREAT, it literally is the best fan I’ve ever had because it moves a ton of air and is super quiet. The fan had also been a gift when we moved into our house, the unit cost over $400 so I didn’t really want to replace it even though our bedroom doesn’t get much natural light so it is pretty dark. 


So since then over the years my wife and I have had to make due with no overhead light. We open the windows during the day, and at night use a combination of bedside lamps and the bathroom light. It’s never really as good of lighting as an overhead lamp so I keep some flashlights up there for when we are cleaning or looking for something etc. 

After 6 years of living in the dark, this winter I just decided I would replace the damn thing. But before I did, I decided to try one last time with another bulb because, however unlikely, it’s possible BOTH bulbs I had tried were bad. 

So I’m up there installing the new bulb, grab the remote (the fan has a remote) and as I’m turning the light on I realize:

The goddamn thing is dimmable. 


For 6 fucking years we lived with the inconvenience of no overhead light and the whole time it was just because the damn thing was set to “dim”. 

Fuck me. 

TL;DR

For 6 years I lived with no bedroom light because the overhead lamp was broken, but turns out it it was fine and it was just set to a dim setting the whole time. "

bbgmzp,tifu,TIFU by spending the last year on reddit talking to myself after being muted.,"Today was the day I realised I messed up by not realising sooner and just thinking my content was shit 

For the last 12 months I've been commenting on peoples posts, I've created my own posts. I haven't had a single upvote or reply to anything.. my karma has been at 885 for as long as I can remember so I just figured I wasnt very interesting (still likely true!)

Last month I started to try and see my own posts through guest accounts and figured out they weren't showing, I could still clearly see my comments and posts on my account. 

Anyway, I finally mailed the help team and found out my IP was accidentally mixed in with some action to take out spammers, if you can see this it's all sorted now (and if you cant, I'm still in my own little Truman show)

If you're procrastinating (and let's face it, you are) feel free to go through my post history and verify the lack of any human engagement..

TL;DR I was muted one year ago and didn't notice. Since then I've spent the whole time thinking how boring I must be because nobody replies  or updoots me.. :-/

Edit: So I've gone from castaway to a full room of people handing me little arrows! Wilson and I thank you xx

Edit 2: this is crazy! Thanks to everyone for all the jewels and things I know nothing about. I'll figure it out and pay it forwards! Special thanks to those that are answering my unanswered questions from previous posts - MVPs!

Please dont be too sad about this, i find it kind of funny that I've been such an idiot for so long. It's ok to laugh with/at me :)

Edit 3: Reddit is awesome. I've missed you guys! Dont feel mad at the mods, its a tough and thankless job and flooders/bots are a real PITA. Its just one of those things and I thank them for putting in the hours.

I also want to use this very brief soap box to raise awareness for mental health. Most of us here use Reddit as an escape, some people here have fewer friends irl than they do on the net. Make sure each other are ok every once in a while (if someone goes missing, like for more than a month....) - if you see someone struggling send them a message of support, even a stranger can help.

I love all of you weirdos <3

Edit 4: No more I promise. I'm completely overwhelmed by the response and the nice feedback. I'm trying to answer all of the questions but its difficult to keep up. I created an /AMA when this thread went down, if you relate to any of the topics close to me like diabetes, gaming, mental health, parenting etc then keep in touch. Heres a shameless pic of me with the best doggo in the world (and authentication for mods) - he listens to me even when you guys dont ;-) https://imgur.com/EgCbe6W

Work was rough today and all I wanted to do afterward was to sit on the couch and let the TV watch me while eating food not cooked by my own hands. The answer to that? Delivery. 

Food ordered, I let the dog into the yard to burn some energy and sat camped outside with him while waiting for the delivery. Doordash, Grubhub, Uber and everyone other than Jehovah's Witnesses has trouble locating my address strictly relying on GPS so it's nothing for me to post up and wait outside for when they are close, flag them down and go back inside for a contactless drop-off. 

Pertinent details before shit hits the fan; my neighbor and I share a fence with a doggy door as our pups are super close and you can bet each time that if my dog is outside, hers will follow for cross-yard playtime. This was the case today and probably bad judgement on my part to think that I would be able to break up the fun quickly. 

Both dogs were in the neighbor’s yard at the time the notification came through that the driver was pulling up and I had to call out a few times to get my dog’s attention. Neighbor thankfully whistled for her dog and I had to put on the ”voice” for mine to acknowledge I existed and then took off running for my door while waving to the driver who by this point was getting out of the car. 

Pup and I have a game called Runaway where I will take off yelling ”RUNAWAY” and literally he will chase after me like some human sized fetch-stick. I use this to my advantage until he realized I was putting him inside but managed to get him through the storm door and close the screen before he could run out. Then realized that I'd left the gate locked like an idiot with the driver standing right outside by this point. 

I didn't have a mask on at this point and neither did she so I yelled from the porch that she could leave the food by the mailbox and that is where the fun started. 

”Is that your dog?”

My bullshit meter didn't go off. I thought she was asking a question with an obvious answer because duh, she was a dog person so I engaged with dog-owner gushiness. Yes; blah, blah, blah... His name is XYZ... Wanna say hi? 

I’ll be nice because you brought my food. 

But she just stood there awkwardly for a moment, put the food down and quickly jumped back into her car. In my mind I was like, ”okay weird” but whatever. Snatched the food and went back inside. Went to wash my hands and from the kitchen window, I can see the full street where she is still parked outside. Thinking “okay weird...” again but didn’t dwell on it too much figuring that she was looking at the route to her next location. 

I went about my business of preparing to destroy my meal. Few minutes later, the dog begins barking manically at the door. I take a glance at the cameras and realize she is still out front parked directly in front of my mailbox. 

Uh...ok? What’s going on here?

I go outside and try to get her attention but she is on the phone and doesn’t notice me. I walk up like I’m going to check the mail and she does pull off, but towards the back of the neighborhood that only has one way in and one way out. Lots of people make that mistake and so you’ll quickly see cars turning back around but she never came back. By this time, I think I’m losing my mind so I go back in but still watching the street for the car to pass. It never does. 

I don’t know, people are weird so I just left it at that and went back to eat. About ten minutes later, dog starts going ham at the door so I check the cameras to see two police cars sitting outside my house. 

I continue to watch the cameras realizing that yup, the cops are getting out of the car and walking back and forth in front of mine and neighbor’s yards. I go out to see if anything is wrong and they introduce themselves before saying they were called because a stolen Golden Retriever was reported at my address and if there was a dog in the home. 

It clicked that Driver had called the police and then explained my version of what happened. They were really respectful and apologetic but asked if I could get Sir Pup. I went ahead and opened the door for the dog who took off, ready to greet the new faces outside. His collar has tags matching the address with my name and phone number on it in case he was ever lost or stolen which was proof enough for them as it was obvious that they wanted to get this over as fast as possible. 

No hard feelings on either side, we were all walking away when Driver’s car slowly comes creeping from the back of the neighborhood. I yelled out to them that the lady was right there and they positioned themselves in front of her car in a way she would have to stop and speak with them. 

I don’t know if this lady was drunk or off her meds but she rolled down the window and was literally sobbing hysterically that she saw me take the dog from the neighbor’s yard, that animals get no justice and the icing on the cake? MY KIND only owns Pittbulls and Rottweilers. There was no way he was mine and needed to be protected. I honestly did not want to deal with that mess so sorry guys, this isn’t a tale of revenge; I went back inside and stayed the fuck on my couch. My day was already shitty. Everyone left a few minutes after that so I assume she got a warning. 

However, I did report the incident to the delivery service and was offered credits towards my next meal. 

I splurged that on a bakery and now am currently fucking up a slice of carrot cake, grateful it didn’t end worse. 

TL; DR

Ordered food, racist delivery person thought I stole my own Golden Retriever and had a breakdown when I didn’t get carted off in handcuffs. Didn’t get shot but got cake in the end.

Edit: Wow, Reddit! Waking up to the massive amounts of love and well wishes was amazing! Thank you so much for your kind words! I am going to do my best and go through every comment and private message. I wish I could share this cake with all of you! Carrot cake lovers unite! Happy to share this pile of awards with other great posts and comments!

Taking the sound advice to keep a close eye on the dog when he goes out. Will also share with neighbor just in case! My husband did agree with many of you to seek further action against the delivery driver but I’m pretty torn on whether to do so. Things are hard out here for all of us including the less savory members of our community but I will take the day to think on the next steps.

I appreciate the sub this was posting to for restoring it after being removed. I apologize that this topic bent the rules and didn’t think 100% before submitting. This was a way to vent. Thank you for allowing this to be a place of dialogue!

3cucye,announcements,An old team at reddit,"Ellen Pao resigned from reddit today by mutual agreement.  I'm delighted to announce that Steve Huffman, founder and the original reddit CEO, is returning as CEO.
 
We are thankful for Ellen’s many contributions to reddit and the technology industry generally.  She brought focus to chaos, recruited a world-class team of executives, and drove growth.  She brought a face to reddit that changed perceptions, and is a pioneer for women in the tech industry.  She will remain as an advisor to the board through the end of 2015.  I look forward to seeing the great things she does beyond that.
 
We’re very happy to have Steve back.  Product and community are the two legs of reddit, and the board was very focused on finding a candidate who excels at both (truthfully, community is harder), which Steve does.  He has the added bonus of being a founder with ten years of reddit history in his head.  Steve is rejoining Alexis, who will work alongside Steve with the new title of “cofounder”.
 
A few other points.  Mods, you are what makes reddit great.  The reddit team, now with Steve, wants to do more for you.  You deserve better moderation tools and better communication from the admins.
 
Second, redditors, you deserve clarity about what the content policy of reddit is going to be.  The team will create guidelines to both preserve the integrity of reddit and to maintain reddit as the place where the most open and honest conversations with the entire world can happen.

Third, as a redditor, I’m particularly happy that Steve is so passionate about mobile.  I’m very excited to use reddit more on my phone.
 
As a closing note, it was sickening to see some of the things redditors wrote about Ellen. [1] The reduction in compassion that happens when we’re all behind computer screens is not good for the world.  People are still people even if there is Internet between you.

If the reddit community cannot learn to balance authenticity and compassion, it may be a great website but it will never be a truly great community.  Steve’s great challenge as CEO [2] will be continuing the work Ellen started to drive this forward.
 
 
[1] Disagreements are fine.  Death threats are not, are not covered under free speech, and will continue to get offending users banned.

Ellen asked me to point out that the sweeping majority of redditors didn’t do this, and many were incredibly supportive. Although the incredible power of the Internet is the amplification of voices, unfortunately sometimes those voices are hateful.
 
[2] We were planning to run a CEO search here and talked about how Steve (who we assumed was unavailable) was the benchmark candidate—he has exactly the combination of talent and vision we were looking for.  To our delight, it turned out our hypothetical benchmark candidate is the one actually taking the job.


NOTE: I am going to let the reddit team answer questions here, and go do an AMA myself now.

hu3e0a,relationship_advice,"[UPDATE] I (29F) keep finding long hairs in my bathroom, which is strange because my husband (32M) is bald and I have a short pixie crop hairstyle"," [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/hr9oxy/i\_29f\_keep\_finding\_long\_hairs\_in\_my\_bathroom/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hr9oxy/i_29f_keep_finding_long_hairs_in_my_bathroom/)  < Original post

&#x200B;

I ultimately decided against getting a secret camera set up because ironically enough I didn't want to betray my partner's trust. Though part of me wanted to get one to squash any worries of someone living in my walls, as per some comments said!

I did though plan to leave work early, which is something I've never done before. My boss allowed me to leave after a half-day.

Upon returning home, nothing seemed amiss. I was expecting another car on the drive or parked outside on the street. There was no other car I didn't recognise. Quietly letting myself in, I was immediately confused. In the hallway, there was a pair of shoes I didn't recognise, and not only that, they looked like men's shoes.

Standing in the hallway trying to work out what to do; if I should sneak around or make my presence known, before I could decide, my husband walked out of the kitchen with two cups of tea. By my husband's face it was obvious he was surprised to see me.

Playing along with naivete, I asked my husband how he could have known I was coming home early to make me tea? Expecting my husband to lie, he surprised me by sitting me down and explaining everything.

At the beginning of lockdown, his friend; someone I'm not all the close with because only met once, was evicted, lost his job, and had been couch surfing. So for some days over the past couple of weeks, this guy has been travelling to our house, and with the acceptance of my husband, using our bathroom to freshen up to attend interviews. He was also borrowing shirts and suits from my husband. As it turns out, my husband's friend has long hair and a beard.

So it turns out my husband isn't cheating on me but was hiding the fact his long-haired friend was coming over to use our shower. After his shower, I ended up meeting ""Dave"", and he turned out to be a very nice bloke just down on his luck. I wished him the best for his socially distanced interview and he went on his way.

I asked my husband why he didn't just tell me, as I wouldn't have had a problem with it. Turns out he was worried about my reaction and me not liking his friend or approving of the situation. He also told me Dave was very embarrassed about the whole situation and didn't want people to know what he was having to do. I told my husband I was starting to believe he was cheating and he was shocked, having not even considering those implications while attempting covering for his friend. I told him this whole thing was ridiculous and even suggested his friend live with us until he's back on his feet.

Funnily enough, my worst-case scenario which was mentioned in the replies was either a homeless man or woman living in my walls and sneakily using the shower. And though this seems to be half the case, I'm glad it wasn't a stranger as such that wasn't unwelcome and someone that wasn't living in my walls!

8swmb2,gaming,"Youtuber ""Potates"" completely plagiarized a post I made on r/Fallout about Fallout 76, and passed it off as his own work. The video is now at 800k views.","EDIT 5: Just wanted to thank everybody for their interest in this topic and in me as a content creator. Now that things are cooling off, I will make an update thread a few days from now to let everybody know how things have turned out. 

There are also hundreds of people encouraging me to make a YouTube channel and I just wanted to acknowledge that. I really appreciate your interest and may set something up, but I don't have anything at this moment to share.

Thanks everybody for their kind words and support. :)

I'm not sure why this thread was locked, I didn't get a message from the mods about it. I assume just because the thread has run its course, and I'm okay with that.

**EDIT 2:**

I had no idea that this thread would blow up in the way that it has -- I only posted here to begin with because a buddy of mine posts here and he said it would be good to share, and maybe get some exposure for the original post. I am pretty overwhelmed with the amount of people who are taking an interest in this and I want to make it abundantly clear that I do not and will not ever support anybody who is dishing out threats and personal attacks against Potates. Be better than that. Thanks.

Potates has DM'd be acknowledging the situation and owning up to it, and does not deserve to be harassed and threatened over this. He has been cool about the whole situation and I am willing to give him the benefit of the doubt, and be cool back. Neither he nor I knew just how crazy this situation was going to get. Again, I am asking you from the bottom of my heart, do not lash out at Potates. Do not harass him, do not harass his family. These actions are 100% wrong and I condemn them wholeheartedly. Calling him out for his behavior is one thing, but when you cross the line into his real life, you have gone too far and need to reexamine your moral compass.

**EDIT 4:**

I am aware that Potates has removed all his videos except for his apology. I am not responsible for this, and I have not filed any kind of DMCA claim against him as we are settling things privately. I have and will continue to encourage him to not delete his YouTube channel, as I believe he can and will bounce back from this controversy. Plagiarism is serious, and there is a lesson here to be learned -- if he respects the content of *all* creators moving forward, then his channel can become a positive part of YouTube again.

It is easy to be angry at this situation, believe me. But I am always willing to give somebody another chance if they are prepared to make a genuine change, and for now, I am willing to give that chance and let things play out.

-------------------

Link to the Potates video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t26s5aMSBWY

Link to my post, which he reads (mostly) verbatim off in his video without any credit to me, or even that it is a post from reddit, whatsoever: https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/8qsx8s/complete_notes_from_the_noclip_documentary/

\^That's a massive Fallout 76 info dump based on the Noclip documentary that had a strong community reaction, and got passed around a lot. It took me a while to write up as I watched the documentary, and I spent a non-trivial amount of time making as it clear and concise as possible, using direct quotes whenever possible. Shout out to when he misread one of my points that said camps are saved as blueprints, and accidentally said ""served as blueprints"" which is a nonsensical statement.

I'm passionate about video games, and love to write about them, even though I'm not a professional. So to see something you've written being plagiarized after putting in time and effort to share that written content with people just hurts a little bit. When you're looking for more opportunities to write in a way that will attract attention, seeing somebody else take that attention can really suck.

He starts his video off at the ""Gameplay"" section of my post, and at the beginning switches up his verbiage a little bit so it's not too obvious. As the video goes on, that stops quickly, and he starts reading every single bullet point almost verbatim. I'm not *too* upset because I'm glad more people got to see the information, but I am a little irritated that he passes it off as his own work. He reads the post like it was his script! Even the way he does the voice over makes it sound as if he is saying these things off the cuff, when in reality he is reading off the words I wrote from a page.  I only found this video at all because I clicked it and wanted to hear new Fallout 76 information -- a minute or two in, I realized that I had heard those words before... because I wrote them!

Here's the thing. If he had shot me a message saying ""hey man, I'd like to quote this post in a video"", I'd have said go for it 100%. If at the beginning of the video he had said something like ""hey guys I found this post on reddit I'd like to read you"", I'd be fine with that. But the fact that he passes this off as if he wrote it all, or as if he took the time to compile this information is definitely frustrating to me. I feel like I put in the work for this, and then this guy turned around and monetized it without even having the decency to acknowledge that it wasn't his. 




EDIT: I see a lot of you commenting on the video saying that he has stolen my content. Unfortunately, it appears as if he is deleting all of those comments as they come in.

---------------


**EDIT 3:***

~~I tried to comment on Potates' apology video, but the comments aren't going through. Here is what I wrote, if I am able to post it directly on the video I will do so in the morning.~~ **EDIT 5:** It appears as if the apology video has been deleted.

> Hey, I'm _Robbie. First off, I would like to lead with the fact that I completely condemn anybody who is issuing any kind of threats to @Potates and his family. Nobody deserves to be threatened and harassed over a situation like this. 

> Secondly, I would encourage @Potates not to delete his YouTube channel. I do not agree that there is no coming back from this. Mistakes were made, feathers were ruffled, and lessons were learned. I have seen smaller YouTube channels come back from worse. I have given Potates full permission to re-post the offending video under the agreement that I am properly credited, and that we can work out our differences in private. I truly believe in the value of giving somebody another chance, and even in spite of everything, I am willing to give Potates another chance.

> This whole situation got out of hand to a degree that nobody could have predicted.  Me and Potates are making things right between us in private as I type this and I am confident that we will come to an understanding.

**[But there’s still hope. The most effective way to can stop this is by driving as many calls as possible to our Senators and Representatives, now through Nov. 22nd. ](https://www.battleforthenet.com)**

We're getting word that there are lawmakers who are sympathetic to our cause and considering taking action to slow the FCC down, but they won’t act unless they get more phone calls from constituents. Also, if your think your Rep's opposed to net neutrality, its all the more reason to call them. Those Reps need to hear your voice more than anyone.

**Please, head over to https://www.battleforthenet.com , and give your Senators and Reps a call telling them to stop the FCC from slashing Title II net neutrality protections.** The time to act is now.

To reach the call in line directly by phone, **call 202-930-8550**.

When you get through to your Rep's office, introduce yourself, be polite, and say: 
> I support ""Title Two"" net neutrality rules and I urge you to oppose the FCC's plan to repeal them. Specifically, I'd like you to contact the FCC Chairman and demand he abandon his current plan.

We also have ready-made banners, modals, and graphics of various sizes here: https://www.battleforthenet.com/#join

""Now let's take up the minorities in our civilization, shall we? Bigger the population, the more minorities. Don't step on the toes of the dog-lovers, the cat-lovers, doctors, lawyers, merchants, chiefs, Mormons, Baptists, Unitarians, second-generation Chinese, Swedes, Italians, Germans, Texans, Brooklynites, Irishmen, people from Oregon or Mexico. The people in this book, this play, this TV serial are not meant to represent any actual painters, cartographers, mechanics anywhere. The bigger your market, Montag, the less you handle controversy, remember that! All the minor minor minorities with their navels to be kept clean. Authors, full of evil thoughts, lock up your typewriters. They did. Magazines became a nice blend of vanilla tapioca. Books, so the damned snobbish critics said, were dishwater. No wonder books stopped selling, the critics said. But the public, knowing what it wanted, spinning happily, let the comic-books survive. And the three-dimensional sex-magazines, of course. There you have it, Montag. It didn't come from the Government down. There was no dictum, no declaration, no censorship, to start with, no! Technology, mass exploitation, and minority pressure carried the trick, thank God. Today, thanks to them, you can stay happy all the time, you are allowed to read comics, the good old confessions, or trade-journals.""  

""Yes, but what about the firemen, then?"" asked Montag.  

""Ah."" Beatty leaned forward in the faint mist of smoke from his pipe. ""What more easily explained and natural? With school turning out more runners, jumpers, racers, tinkerers, grabbers, snatchers, fliers, and swimmers instead of examiners, critics, knowers, and imaginative creators, the word `intellectual,' of course, became the swear word it deserved to be. You always dread the unfamiliar. Surely you remember the boy in your own school class who was exceptionally 'bright,' did most of the reciting and answering while the others sat like so many leaden idols, hating him. And wasn't it this bright boy you selected for beatings and tortures after hours? Of course it was. We must all be alike. Not everyone born free and equal, as the Constitution says, but everyone made equal. Each man the image of every other; then all are happy, for there are no mountains to make them cower, to judge themselves against. So! A book is a loaded gun in the house next door. Burn it. Take the shot from the weapon. Breach man's mind. Who knows who might be the target of the well-read man? Me? I won't stomach them for a minute. And so when houses were finally fireproofed completely, all over the world (you were correct in your assumption the other night) there was no longer need of firemen for the old purposes. They were given the new job, as custodians of our peace of mind, the focus of our understandable and rightful dread of being inferior; official censors, judges, and executors. That's you, Montag, and that's me."""

I mention I didn't really see the point, if I'm going to pay for a book I'd rather own it, I say. She gives me a strange look but just brushes the remark off.

Later, somebody is talking about libraries on reddit and how they are so great. I said that, while the selection is great, amazon is much better.

""Yeah but you have to pay for them on Amazon""

And thats when some gears started turning. 

So I started looking into it. Turns out, for years I've always, mistakingly, though that, while the card was free, you had a rental fee to pay whenever you rent the books. I always figured that if I'm going to pay a fee to rent them, I would rather pay a little extra and keep them without worrying about late fees. Saves money, can read at my own place, and has led to a respectable book shelf.

Turns out I was wrong. So so wrong.

I had no idea the books were free. I went to the library the very next day and got a card. Then I find out I can rent the books online and have them delivered to my kindle!

Not all of these books have crazy symbolism and story arcs and deep character/world building, some of them were just fun reads.

&#x200B;

I have read nearly every classic science fiction book available, and a lot of contemporary and non-classics as well.  Also, a disclaimer: there is no cyberpunk in here, no Stephenson or Gibson.  I have tried to read several cyberpunk authors and simply didn't find them enjoyable, despite the talent that is clearly present in their writings and world building skills.  Oh, and I haven't read the Foundation series, so that's why it's not on here (yet).   


Apologies for not doing a top 25 (or even a top 100 that was requested), I just don't have the time.

&#x200B;

So, without further ado, here are my top 15:

&#x200B;

1. **The Sparrow (Mary Doria Russell)** **-** I addressed this in my previous post, I thought this book was fantastic. The first half is slow, yes, but the second half more than made up for it in my opinion.  A Jesuit priest and his friends discover singing coming from a planet 4-5 light years away.  The Jesuits are the first to be able to mount an expedition to this new planet, and the priest and his friends are the crew selected to lead it.  The story starts with the priest, back on Earth after the trip, and all of humanity wants him dead or imprisoned.  This book gave me a more intense emotional reaction than any book I've ever read.  I literally shouted out loud ""NO NO no no no no no no..."" at one point and had to put it down for the day.
2. **Hyperion Series (Dan Simmons)** \- The Sparrow knocked this out of first place, yes, but I haven't read the sequel to it, so as far as series of books go, this one is at the top bar none.  I preferred the first two books, but the second two were very fun reads as well.  7 people are selected all around the universe to venture into the Time Tombs in a mysterious planet with a violent and murderous monster on it known as the Shrike.  That's all I can say, this story is so sprawling that anything more than that just doesn't do it justice. Just an all around unbelievable experience.
3. **The Stand (Steven King)** \- A virus wipes out 99% of the population, and the survivors have dreams that direct them to either Boulder, CO, where civilization is starting to rebuild (symbolically Heaven), or Las Vegas, which is more a Mad-Max-everyones-killing-each-other-no-laws-type society (symbolically Hell). Whether you consider it science fiction or not, this deserves to make the list.  Loved this one.  I've heard it compared to Swan Song, so I was excited to pick that up, but was ultimately disappointed.  There's no argument to be made for SS being better than The Stand.
4. **I, Robot (Isaac Asimov) -** I picked this book up semi-dreading the read, and just trying to work my way through the classics.  I figured it was one of those classics that everyone wants to have read but no one wants to read.  I was dead wrong.  I knew it was going to make a statement about A.I., but I didn't know how entertaining it was going to be.  Every story, every section, every word was also run to read, and the writing style kept my attention from start to finish.
5. **Dune (Frank Herbert) -** No surprise here, it's an absolute classic. Not much to say about this book that hasn't already been said.  If you haven't read it, do so immediately.
6. **The Forge of God** **(Greg Bear)** \- An alien lands in the United States, and the only message he can give us before he dies is ""I'm sorry, I'm too late"" or something to that effect.  I love alien contact novels, and this was probably my favorite.  Sprawling, a lot of characters, a lot of viewpoints and different situation.  Huge action, a real page-turner.  This isn't the most philosophical or complex book, but it is a massively fun read. And the end, damn the end was crazy. I could definitely see it being made into a movie, but it doesn't have the feel of a novel written *specifically* to be made into a movie.
7. **The Forever War (Joe Haldeman) -** I believe this was the first military sci-fi book I read.  I didn't know much about military sci-fi and was doubtful that I would like it, especially since it sounded like a parallel of the Vietnam War.  Again, dead wrong. This book has a lot to say, and it says it extremely eloquently.  Humanity is in an interstellar war against the Taurens, and the soldiers who visit home (because of time dilation) visit after huge periods of time, so it's a good take on where humanity will be in 500, 1000, and 10000 years from now. Again, this one was hard to put down.  
8. **Not Alone (Craig Falconer)** \- A lot of you probably haven't heard of this book, I think it's pretty obscure.  Why is it so high up on this list?  Well some of my favorite novels are alien first-contact novels, and my favorite *parts* of those novels are the moments between a group of people finding out about the existence of ETs and whole world finding out about them.  This book is that idea under a magnifying glass. A UFO enthusiast stumbles upon incontrovertible evidence that not only do aliens exist, but that humanity has had contact with them for years.  And what does he do?  He leaks it anonymously on Twitter, which of course leads to a melt down as the world sees the evidence.  Great book, in fact I enjoyed it so much I messaged Craig Falconer on Facebook after I finished it just to tell him what a fun read I thought it was.
9. **The Sirens of Titan (Kurt Vonnegut) -** An interstellar story as only Vonnegut could tell it. My favorite Vonnegut book besides maybe his Welcome to the Monkey House collection of short stories.  If you've never read any Vonnegut, I'd still say it's a great place to start.
10. **Nightfall (Isaac Asimov + Robert Silverberg)** \- Takes place on a planet in a multiple star solar system that never experiences night.  Within even 15 minutes of pure darkness, residents of the planet lose their minds or even die. Scientists on the planet discover that once every 2000 years, there is a total solar eclipse that leave the planet in complete darkness, which matches up with the fact that once every 2000 years their entire civilization completely caves in.  Of course they make this discovery very close to the 2000 year mark.
11. **Old Man's War (John Scalzi) -** Military sci-fi, the elderly can basically get a complete regeneration of their body, restoring them to their 20s, if they agree to fight in an interstellar war.  I'm not making it sound very interesting, but it was a great read.
12. **Childhood's End (Arthur C. Clarke) -** Mmmm love me some Arthur C. Clarke. A peaceful alien invasion happens, with the result being that the aliens will share a technology, etc, if humanity agrees to end all wars, ban slavery, things of that nature.  Humans do, and the results humanity sees within themselves, and the changes the Overlords bring make quite the interesting novel.
13. **Spin (Robert Charles Wilson) -** One night, all the stars go out.  It's discovered that someone or something has put a permeable membrane all around Earth, and no one knows why.  Of course our protagonist dedicates his life to figuring out what's going on.  I particularly liked the ending to this book.  Great read, fun.
14. **Starship Troopers (Robert Heinlein)-** Another military sci fi in the vein of Old Man's War and The Forever War.  I think I read all 3 of these back to back.  They're sort of the heavy hitters of the military sci-fi genre, and I loved everyone one of them.  Other military sci-fi I've tried to read, and they just don't do it for me. 
15. **Footfall (Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle)** \- Almost forgot this one, but it's about an alien invasion where the aliens aren't *that* far ahead of humans, technologically.  And they show up to our planet expecting us to still be in the stone age, so they're surprised when they see how little time it's taken us to come so far.  Extremely entertaining, and gives viewpoints from both human and alien characters.  The only thing I didn't like was how the aliens supposedly looked.  Like baby elephants, pretty much.

&#x200B;

**Honorable Mentions:** Ringworld, Out of the Dark, I am Legend, The Three-Body Problem, War of the Worlds, Rendezvous with Rama, Calculating God, Roadside Picnic, The Puppet Masters

&#x200B;

Yes, I'm sure I've forgotten some good ones, be it intentionally or not, I'm writing this over my lunch break.  


Anyway, that's my list.  Hope you enjoyed, and hopefully it gave you some recommendations for future reading.  Feel free to message me for specific recommendations or anything else.


Edit: Yep forgot the Enders Game series, probably should be on there. I read it like 30 times when I was a kid and sometimes forget it’s even science fiction.

Edit2: Since I guess I'm on the front page now, here's a quick edit.  I know I should read the Foundation Series, The Culture series, and Vinge's A Fire Upon the Deep.  I read before bed a lot and these huge, sprawling space operas can sometimes be a lot after a long day.  And I stand by decision to put Starship Troopers over Stranger in a Strange Land, but I'll allow that both Stranger and Moon is a Harsh Mistress should probably have been an honorable mention.  Also for any of you that read or have read #8, Not Alone, I'd love to know what you think about it.

dhgug9,books,"10 years ago I was the type of person to always have a book in their hand, on their nightstand, in their bag - I was reading upwards of 20+ books a year. Somewhere along the line the internet completely overtook my reading hobby. After a few years of almost no reading at all, I'm finally back in!","I'm sure there aren't many who actually care, but I'm feeling good so I thought I'd share! 

Growing up, I was the biggest bibliophile. I'd read whatever, whenever, wherever. My favorite past time was reading, and my second favorite past time was finding new books to read. I'd devour whole books in one sitting, whole series in one week. I had a genuine, unrelenting passion for words and I did whatever I could to consume them. 

I don't know what happened, but somewhere along the line my phone/the internet/social media slowly inched its way into the space which once held my desire to read. My attention span got to the point that even when/if I did try to read a book, I couldn't make it past a page without having to put it down and do something else. In the past couple of years I've read only a very small handful of books - some of which took me months or even the entire year. I've had years pass without picking up a single book, despite having hundreds at my disposal. I've realised just how much social media and other electronic activities have invaded and infiltrated my life multiple times throughout the years, but the idea of doing what I once loved became scary and daunting. I'd pick up a book to try and break the cycle, but I'd get hit with the new goldfish-attention-span, or my phone would ding, or I'd sit there and re-read the same page over and over again 17 times before realising I was still on the same page. 

I think for a while there I just gave up. I didn't feel the things I used to feel while reading, I couldn't recreate that genuine desire. I resigned to the idea that the thing I used to love most was just a long forgotten chapter in an old part of my life. I stopped trying. 

But a couple of weeks ago, I decided to have a Harry Potter movie marathon for the first time in a while. I got sucked in, moreso than usual - and had an idea. Of all the times I've tried to get back into reading, I had never tried to re-read something that I used to love. I always tried the latest hits, or something I heard about somewhere. I had never thought to revisit an old love, try to rekindle that old flame by well, rekindling an old flame! So I went out, bought the first book in the Harry Potter series (one of my absolute favorites when I was younger) and decided to give it a go. I put my phone away, made myself a cozy reading area, and just decided to try it without forcing myself into the pressure of trying on a new book. 

Now I know it's still early on, but I honestly think it's done the trick. I sat down, with the idea that I would give it 15-30 minutes to start, and ended up devouring the whole book in less than a couple of hours. I loved being able to revisit this world that I used to love so much, and I loved being able to discover new things within a story I was already familiar with. It's been less than 48 hours since I started, and I'm already onto the 3rd book. That's almost 3 books in 48 hours -- which is 3 more books than I've read in the past 2(?) years! I know a lot of people have issues with re-reading books/series, I used to be one of them, but I genuinely believe that the magic and wonder of your first read can be visited again - and has the power to change you just as it did the first time around.

8p2s83,books,Increase Your Cognitive Ability By Reading A Fucking Book For Once,
ayrfyg,books,I finally had the realization that it's ok to stop reading a book that you aren't enjoying.,"I know, this probably seems like an absurd idea to many, but I have always felt as though I have an obligation to finish any story that I begin to read, so I have been extremely hesitant to read something that I saw outside my comfort zone. I always felt like I had to force myself to finish a story that I started no matter what, which in turn stretched out the time that it took to read said books and prevented me from reading other things on my list. It was beginning to be exhausting when trying to choose a new book, due to the fact that I was worried about the time I would lose having to finish something that I wasn't enjoying.

Recently I read through the first two books of the Kingkiller Chronicles and found myself completely fascinated with the world and story, so I decided to read ""The Slow Regard of Silent Things"" in hopes to satiate my desire to get more stories within Patrick Rothfuss's universe. About 25% of my way into the book, I realized that I was not enjoying the story, but again I felt like I owed it to the book to finish it, due to my love of the original works. After forcing myself to continue for a few weeks, I finally decided that this book just wasn't for me, even though I really enjoyed the original material. I decided, for the first time, to place it on my shelf, unfinished. I was surprised at how liberating it was and have now moved onto a new book that I have been dying to read and absolutely devouring it. It's almost like knowing that I can toss a book aside if I'm not enjoying it has made me even more eager to read. It's a pretty good feeling.

Has anybody else had a similar feeling? Or do you still feel obligated to finish something once you have started it, even if you aren't enjoying it?

Edit: Thanks for the gold, but if you find yourself in a giving mood think about donating to the National Center for Family Learning or your local literacy programs!"

That was why I embraced the idea of teaching a MasterClass. So...now I’m here on Reddit to chat with you about the MasterClass I've made on the art and the craft of storytelling. And because this is an AMA, I'm expecting questions about my novels, comics, television, films, wife, porridge recipes and the airspeed velocity of unladen swallows. Ask me, well, anything.”

glberg,books,I never realised that losing my love for reading was a sign of depression.,"Recently I have started trying to get back into reading. I used to LOVE reading when I was younger, even in the early years of high school I would sometimes just go to the library and read during lunch. And then I just stopped. 

I always told myself “I’m just too stressed with school”, “oh I’m just in a reading slump I’ll come out of it soon”, but I never got back into reading. I would try and try but as we all know, forcing yourself to read is not going to help. And then the diagnosis of depression came and even then, I still put my lack of reading to being stressed and in a slump. 

It wasn’t until yesterday when I was talking to my sister about how I was getting back in to reading again and I was nearly finished my second book in three days. 

She said “oh you’re turning into me”. 

I wasn’t. She had turned into me, a lover of books and getting lost in the pages. I then realised that it wasn’t a slump. It was my depression that had caused my love for reading to just disappear and I think that is a valuable piece of information I want to share because it has been nearly 5 years since I really sat down and read and read and read, and now that I’m somewhat on the uphill, I’m finding my footing in the reading world again.

Edit: I want to preface that I am not implying that if you have lost your love of reading that you have depression, nor that if you have depression you will lose your love for reading. As a nursing student I know that the signs are different for everyone. I am aware that this is not always a sign of depression for everyone. I just know that if I were back in the darkest spot in my life, seeing a post like this where I can relate to what the OP is saying and feel justified in my feelings, would have positively impacted my journey to where I am. 

We are not all the same in our journeys but we are all the same in our need for justification in the feelings that we may have when in a period of depression. Many people do not feel that what they are experiencing is valid and do not feel like what they are feeling is important. Raising awareness for even the littlest of signs is the least that we can do to push someone to seek the help they need. Justifying their feelings so that they feel that their experience is valid is the most important tool in helping people to get help. 

My goal was to help just one person realise that they are not alone and that losing their love of reading is a valid feeling in the dark times in our life."

Edit #2: how the fuck did this happen

Edit #3: I want to take this opportunity to say a few things about borderline. Honestly I really don't like referring to borderline with that particular moniker, because I find it reactionary and overt and misleading. I prefer Emotional Regulation Stndrome because it's nicer and more accurate. I find my condition to be more akin to autism than something like anti social personality disorder or sociopathy/psychopathy, all the things media sources tend to group us capricious messes up with.

ERS people can and often are insufferable  under the right (wrong) conditions, which seem to be rampant in the context of our current social conventions.

 It is wrong to institutionalize us, as you watch us lose all sense and reason, using our reaction to your reaction as the means to dignify grouping us up with damaged strangers in sanitary squalor. You crumble our precarious psyches, which then become pernicious, and then the marginalization of our lives becomes the natural needed course of action for everyone in our lives, our vicinity, our perceived reality.

 It is sad and it needs to stop. Determinism is at play and the means and the end in terms of how you treat us is fucked, we do not want to become this. 200,000 men with BPD/ERS statistically will commit suicide and it breaks my heart because I know what feelings they will use as fuel.

Final update: this post will be referenced as I shop my manuscript around to publishers. Almost a quarter of a million views....still unbelievable. I'm about 70% done with the edits I was given and then....man, who knows.

Thanks for everything Reddit. You made me feel amazing and increased my chances ten fold. I love you all, truly."

lrsy8i,books,Rant here but I hate when books use movie posters as their cover art.,"It's one of my biggest pet peeves. I love beautiful cover art on books and I hate to say I do judge a book by its cover. There's this book I want its a Swedish horror novel and every single copy I can find the cover is a still from the movie adaption. I hate being this picky but when I know the original cover art for the book is nice I don't want a film poster on it. I almost don't even want to get the book. I've seen this trend happen with a lot books that turned into movies and frankly I don't care that it's a movie. I'm here for the book! I don't want to see the movie cover I want to see the original book cover. I love how unique book cover art can be and I feel like slapping the movie poster on every new copy does the book a slight disservice. I know im sounding like a cover snob and  I know there's more to books than the book cover but I cant help but being annoyed when it's all I can find for new copies.

Edit: on a happier note here's some of my favorite book covers.

Edit edit: I'm sorry I didn't realize this was such an overused topic on the sub. I have only been a member on this sub for a few months so I didn't know. Was just a little rant and don't have any reader friends irl to share it with so I came here instead.

Edit 3: I appreciate every single one of you!! I also appreciate all this new info I learned about why movie covers are so important including some personal stories I read. I haven't been able to reply to everyone but I've been reading through all your comments! I know I was being over dramatic here and I still wish with certain books it wasn't so hard or expensive to get their original books ( Im looking at you ""Let The Right One In"" ). But as someone who has always been passionate about writing and reading I can't ignore the fact that movie covers helps the book industry and authors. So for that I'm super grateful! Anyways I just want to say I love you all here and thanks for educating me on the importance of them❤ I also want to say it was so fun seeing all you passionate readers here it warms my little heart."

""Wow"", I though, ""this AMAZING game is based on a book, must be doubly amazing, I must read it!""

Oh no, and so I have. Atlas Shrugged is a **terrible** book. It reads like fanfic. Atlas Shrugged is like ""50 shades of gray"", but for the economy.

It's a long winded love letter to capitalism, with engineers and CEOs being by far the smartest, purest and best beings on our Earth, basically Disney princesses in suits, with doves landing  on their lapels and everything.

Being an inventor or a capitalist basically means you're the world champion of philosophy, limbo and sex.

This goes for women too! Well, A woman who's equal to them in every way, except when she gets horny and requires a good tending to, you know, like a silly woman does. But only by her intellectually and entrepreneurial equal, can't have some schmo with no patents to his name caress your snow-white complexion with his rough inventor hands, looking at you with steely blue eyes.

The grand finale is some guy reading out a manifesto on a radio or something to the entire Earth, everybody sits and listens in silence for hours because that's what 80 pages of it felt like.

Why is Atlas Shrugged so revered?

**Edit:** half of the comments answer it's not revered at all, the other half are calling me an idiot for not understanding its majesty.

It's not a book about economy or capitalism because they don't work even close to what the book describes, the version of capitalism and social dynamics outlined in the book is the ""Saturday morning cartoon"" version at best."

gx71we,books,"Sixty years ago, Harper Lee was already telling the world that #BlackLivesMatter ✊🏿","I just finished reading “To Kill A Mockingbird” and it is by far one of the best thought-provoking novels I’ve read so far. It is one of those books that actually makes you think and not the one that thinks for you. The quote “You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view. Until you climb inside of his skin and walk around in it.” will always stay with me.

What quote/scene from To Kill A Mockingbird is unforgettable for you?

EDIT: Just to be clear, when I said “60 years ago, Harper Lee was already advocating for Black Lives Matter” I didn’t mean to single-out every person who had been fighting for it since day 1 or that it was Lee who first fought for it. This is my first time to actually get this tons of upvotes here on Reddit and I’m just surprised how some people could easily misinterpret what you genuinely mean. 

On the other hand, I truly appreciate all the recommendations which people said to be better representations of the long fight against systemic racism than TKAM. I’ll definitely check them out.

Lastly, a lot of you were saying that if I loved TKAM that much, don’t even bother reading “Go Set A Watchman” because it’ll definitely ruin the former for me and the characters I’ve learned to love. Well, if I’m being honest here, that makes me want to read it even more. I guess I will have to see it for myself in order to fully grasp and understand where people are coming from. Also, people were saying the latter was a product of exploitation and actually the first draft of TKAM which publishers rejected hence I shouldn’t really see it as a sequel. But I beg to differ, why can’t we just see it as a study of how the novel we know and love that is TKAM came to be and how Harper Lee’s idea evolved and changed instead of seeing it as a separate novel?"

It shows up. She starts reading it and realizes, ""damn, this is a long intro of some random dude."" I pick up the book, look at the author and I'm like, ""sweetie, who is this author? The author from the movie is S Morgenstein. Who is this William Goldman? Some dude trying to profit on some classic.""

This William Goldman's guy is on the front of the book, but the book I know - the book mentioned in the movie - the author is S Morgenstein. Like, what the hell is this William Goldman think he's doing putting his name on it?

It gets worse. After an intro that is like a sixth of the book by this rando, he starts interjecting in the middle of the book. Or worse yet REMOVING parts of the book and then letting us know he cut some of the story out so we wouldn't have to worry about it. Oh my gawd. The nerve on this guy.

I'm thinking, ""This idiot must have bought the rights from the estate of Morgenstein and then brutalized the book without consequence and republished it. This is the worst.""

So my wife sends the book back and buys another copy.

IT'S THE EXACT FUCKING SAME THING!!!

Surely there are some actual original publications out there right?! Without all this extra crap!!! SO we can have the ORIGINAL experience!!!

I literally pull open reddit to write this very tirade expressing my frustration and I think, ""Hold up. Who is this William Goldman?""

Turns out... it was originally written this way.

So yeah. I'm an idiot.

Edit: Well shit, it's spelled ""Morgenstern."" Ty for the solidarity those who have fallen for sneaky Goldman also. We stand in our united in our gullibility."

6qxh4l,books,I've had a problem with this sub for a while. Does anyone agree?,"Hello,

I’ve been posting on r/books for a few years now, and while I have enjoyed a lot of the interactions and discussions I’ve had, there’s something about the sub that is really starting to bug me. Maybe some of you feel the same.

I was reading a post yesterday, where the OP (16 years old) was asking for recommendations about more ‘mature’ books. He enjoyed reading YA and stuff, but wondered what else was out there. When someone asked him why he would want to do this, OP said something along the lines of he felt ‘ashamed’ to still be reading these kinds of books.

Someone downvoted him for it. Similarly, looking down the thread I could see that many people who had offered recommendations about mature books had been down voted. I then started thinking about threads that I have commented on. There has been so many times where I have tried to contribute thoughtfully to a discussion – just like the 16 year old OP - but because others didn’t agree, I’ve been downvoted.

I can’t be the only person to have noticed this trend, and it’s a bummer. r/books is a place where we *discuss* and share opinions about the thing we love most of all – books. It should be a place where we can get inspiration and, hopefully, learn about writers that ordinarily would have passed us by. But instead, I feel like there are a lot of people here that treat the place as a zero-sum game, where they are ‘right’ and you are ‘wrong’ – and downvote accordingly. *You don’t like my favourite book?* - Downvote. *You explain why in a thoughtful, polite manner that encourages further discussion?* - Fuck you. Downvote. The more this trend continues, the more the sub declines until all that’s left are people jealously guarding their opinions, unable to hear those of others over the roar of their internal rage.

I mean, I try and my bit to combat this. I don’t downvote other people’s opinions, even if they are very different from my own, and I do this because that’s not what the function is for. The sidebar: *It is our intent and purpose to foster and encourage in-depth discussion […] in a safe, supportive environment.* I save the downvotes for people who break these rules - the trolls and dickheads spewing racism.

Which isn’t to say I’m perfect – I’ve got into some heated arguments on here and said some stuff I’ve regretted, but in those instances I’ve tried to apologise because after I’d calmed down, I realised that while we all have different personal tastes – they are just that: personal tastes. They are not objective. In the same way, r/books frustrates me sometimes in how it’s focused on the same books (Hitchhikers, TLoTR, Pratchett, Gaiman etc.), but I don’t downvote these threads or the people commenting on them, because this is a place where people should be allowed to discuss their passions without getting blue-arrowed. 

The world is full of people screaming at each other with their fingers in their ears. r/books doesn’t have to become another such place.

I have a feeling I’m opening myself up to a world of hurt with this post, but fuck it – I care about the sub, and want to see it thrive.

kfjwug,books,Ever catch yourself simply reading the words on a page without even digesting any of them?,"My initial reaction was to attribute it to the pernicious impact of digitalization and how it's basically eradicated my attention span (which I'm desperately attempting to rebuild by reading and reducing my time imbibing immediately gratifying content online) - however the more I think about it -  it's probably also my mild OCD, anxiety, ADHD etc doing it's thing.

Very rarely can I actually get immersed in a book, oftentimes I feel like Ron Burgundy who spoils humorous moments by bluntly remarking 'we are laughing!' - but in the context of reading I'm sitting there scanning the words thinking 'wow would you look at me reading Dostoevsky. Quite the learned individual aren't I.' and I sometimes go into a fuckin weird inner monologue that ends with a David Mitchel rant 'words don't really exist do they, they're just a collection of squiggly lines that someone gave meaning to...look at how stupid that one looks'.

It sounds a bit amusing but it's really fuckin frustrating.

Then there's the ambience of the room and external distractions, the discomfort of holding the book open, my itchy ass, not wanting to crease the spine of the book too much blah blah... I'm just disappointed with myself for struggling so much to read. I went years without much reading, and I was expecting some challenge upon returning to it, but not to this level.

Well It appears that I'm not alone in this issue... I'm not too sure if this should come as a relief or not...

**Edit 2:** 

For the record I wasn't trying to be a pretentious bastard with my writing. If it came across that way it's because I actually went on a crusade to learn every word in the English language over half a decade or so  - I've forgotten most of them but occasionally an obscure word will slip into my writing because it's actually the first word that sprung to mind, not because I was looking up rare synonyms on [thesaurus.com](https://thesaurus.com) to prove how intelofgent I am.  

I have had a bit of fun calling girls pulchritudinous and watching them got offended before discovering the meaning of it, but overall it's been a waste of time and all it's really done is get me mislabelled as being a pompous prick when I'm not trying to be. "

It should be a must read in school and shows key economic problems (e.g. economic inequality, affordable education etc). and facist tatics which should be dealt with to maintain healthy democracies and identify extremist politicians.

Edit: Wow this blew up more than i expected! Through the discussion i had so far I have to admit that reading only a book from one point of view is in some way political indoctrination if the book is not sufficiently cricitally analyzed and discussed in class which is difficult as teachers may not be completely umbiased. Thus a book covering opposing views should be covered aswell to provide a full overview. However, all in all i believe reading these books are better at giving an understanding of these forms of governance  than just plain theory, films or fictional books.

It's just an appreciation of Huxley's world-building. As per me, we're being controlled yes, but without 1984's upfront and ruthless hate. 

 I'll let this quote by Neil Postman sum it up: 

""What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one. Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egoism. Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. Orwell feared we would become a captive culture. Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture, preoccupied with some equivalent of the feelies, the orgy porgy, and the centrifugal bumblepuppy.

In short, Orwell feared that what we hate will ruin us. Huxley feared that what we love will ruin us.""

7yx500,books,"13 years ago today Hunter S. Thompson committed suicide. My favorite thing he ever wrote is his ""wave"" speech.","“Strange memories on this nervous night in Las Vegas. Five years later? Six? It seems like a lifetime, or at least a Main Era—the kind of peak that never comes again. San Francisco in the middle sixties was a very special time and place to be a part of. Maybe it meant something. Maybe not, in the long run . . . but no explanation, no mix of words or music or memories can touch that sense of knowing that you were there and alive in that corner of time and the world. Whatever it meant. . . .

History is hard to know, because of all the hired bullshit, but even without being sure of “history” it seems entirely reasonable to think that every now and then the energy of a whole generation comes to a head in a long fine flash, for reasons that nobody really understands at the time—and which never explain, in retrospect, what actually happened.

My central memory of that time seems to hang on one or five or maybe forty nights—or very early mornings—when I left the Fillmore half-crazy and, instead of going home, aimed the big 650 Lightning across the Bay Bridge at a hundred miles an hour wearing L. L. Bean shorts and a Butte sheepherder's jacket . . . booming through the Treasure Island tunnel at the lights of Oakland and Berkeley and Richmond, not quite sure which turn-off to take when I got to the other end (always stalling at the toll-gate, too twisted to find neutral while I fumbled for change) . . . but being absolutely certain that no matter which way I went I would come to a place where people were just as high and wild as I was: No doubt at all about that. . . .

There was madness in any direction, at any hour. If not across the Bay, then up the Golden Gate or down 101 to Los Altos or La Honda. . . . You could strike sparks anywhere. There was a fantastic universal sense that whatever we were doing was right, that we were winning. . . .

And that, I think, was the handle—that sense of inevitable victory over the forces of Old and Evil. Not in any mean or military sense; we didn’t need that. Our energy would simply prevail. There was no point in fighting—on our side or theirs. We had all the momentum; we were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave. . . .

So now, less than five years later, you can go up on a steep hill in Las Vegas and look West, and with the right kind of eyes you can almost see the high-water mark—that place where the wave finally broke and rolled back.”"

7rou7e,books,"If you're familiar with George Orwell's 1984 and Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, then I think you'd be interested in Amusing Ourselves to Death by Neil Postman(published in 1985). Here's the intro:","We were keeping our eye on 1984. When the year came and the prophecy didn't, thoughtful Americans sang softly in praise of themselves. The roots of liberal democracy had held. Wherever else the terror had happened, we, at least, had not been visited by Orwellian nightmares.
But we had forgotten that alongside Orwell's dark vision, there was another - slightly older, slightly less well known, equally chilling: Aldous Huxley's Brave New World. Contrary to common belief even among the educated, Huxley and Orwell did not prophesy the same thing. Orwell warns that we will be overcome by an externally imposed oppression. But in Huxley's vision, no Big Brother is required to deprive people of their autonomy, maturity and history. As he saw it, people will come to love their oppression, to adore the technologies that undo their capacities to think.

What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one. Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egoism. Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. Orwell feared we would become a captive culture. Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture, preoccupied with some equivalent of the feelies, the orgy porgy, and the centrifugal bumblepuppy. As Huxley remarked in Brave New World Revisited, the civil libertarians and rationalists who are ever on the alert to oppose tyranny ""failed to take into account man's almost infinite appetite for distractions"". In 1984, Huxley added, people are controlled by inflicting pain. In Brave New World, they are controlled by inflicting pleasure. In short, Orwell feared that what we hate will ruin us. Huxley feared that what we love will ruin us.

This book is about the possibility that Huxley, not Orwell, was right.

edit: Woke up in the middle of the night to my dog jumping on my bed and licking his crotch and saw this post blowing up. Glad to see it resonates with so many beyond myself. I would also like to plug Infinite Jest and DFW's work in general, one of the reasons I found Neil Postman. Infinite Jest is about a Huxley-an dystopian future where advertisers buy the rights to name years, therapy tries to get you to release your inner infant, and a wheelchair-bound group of assassins tries to destabilize the world by disseminating a video that is so entertaining you desire nothing else in life but to watch it.

gv7kts,books,Friendly reminder that YA books are for teenagers.,"Now before you jump on me, this is not an adults can't read YA post. This is a adults who read YA need to remember who YA is for post. 

I've been floating around the arc (advanced reader copy) circuit for a while. Read some good stuff, read some bad, read some meh. This past weekend I had the privilege of reading one of the best books I've had the privilege of reading in a long time. YA fantasy that was beautifully written and equal parts dark, funny and suspenseful. The teenaged characters acted authentically like teenagers, which unfortunately is incredibly rare in YA. 

Edit: For those who are interested, the book is Remnants of Atonement by G.P McKenna. It doesn't release until October, so likely only available through netgalley, but if you have an account and enjoy ya fantasy, I highly recommend requesting it. 

Today I logged on to leave my feedback and thought I would nosey around in the reviews, only for my heart to sink. Everybody seemed to agree the plot was good and the writing was fantastic, but so many people were complaining that the characters acted too much like teenagers. One reviewer even praised the plot but only gave it one star because ""it was too obvious that the characters were 15/16 years old and that annoyed me.""

Again, these are YA books. They are intended for teenaged readers. If you enjoy reading them too, that's great, but understand that. If you find teenagers annoying, go read literally anything else. You have the rest of the book store, the rest of the library. Don't complain that the 16 year old character acts too much like a 16 year old because what happens then is -because as adults we have the money - the market will continue to push YA characters who are 35 year old accountants stuck in the body of a 17 year old assassin. The list of books teenagers can relate to goes down, isolating them from their own catagory. 

Long story short, let teenagers read teenaged characters who act like teenagers. Stop isolating real life teenagers by appropriating the ya catagory when you have every other book to choose from if you don't like the teenaged voice. Support young readers by letting ya characters be kids!"

I’m currently a college senior, and only recently started reading for leisure. The emotions that these books evoke while i’m reading is truly amazing, to the point where I find myself lying the book on my chest and relishing the messages that just pop out of the page. Books are a tool used to deepen ourselves and change the way we see the world around us, the authors of the past have so many great insights that I wish I appreciated earlier in my academic and personal life. Just do yourself a favor and read your Faulkner, Twain, Huxley, Sinclair, etc.

EDIT: Hey guys, after reading many of your comments, I realized I may have come off a bit strong in pushing what’s assigned to us in school. However, that wasn’t truly my intention. What I more or less meant to say is you should give the assigned readings a chance, because we may often overlook some good pieces of literature. With that, “try to read your Faulkner, Twain, Huxley, and Sinclair.” Also, I have nothing wrong with spark-notes, I shouldn’t have made that title. Spark-notes is a wonderful resource that definitely helps us better understand some really difficult reading material, but it should be a supplement and if you’re really really not enjoying the book, just spark-note the dang thing!"

The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire’s flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It’s not desiring the fall; it’s terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling ‘Don’t!’ and ‘Hang on!’, can understand the jump. Not really. You’d have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling."""

6mf2a8,books,The Animorphs were a lot darker than what you possibly remember as a kid,"Here are some of the spoilers you missed out on by not reading Animorphs:

Five children are forced to engage in guerilla warfare, espionage and repeated murder to protect their loved ones from alien parasites as they wait for the other, heroic aliens to finally arrive.



 When they do, the “good” aliens turn out to not give a shit about humans, caused the whole intergalactic war through their own shittiness and are willing to exterminate whole planets themselves to get at their hated enemies.


A child repeatedly experiences his intestines hanging out of his body while in various animal forms


A child is mentally tortured until broken and never gets better

A child in the form of a fly experiences getting splattered and smeared against a ceiling until his friends who are also flies at the time can peel his body off and take him somewhere he can transform back into a whole human before his insect mind fades completely


A child is shrunken and experiences having her eyeballs digested out of her head inside her friend’s stomach while she’s in the form of a tiny elephant


The heroes are forced to permanently imprison another child in the body of a rat because he knows too much and they abandon him on a tiny island with only other rats and garbage for company.


 Rumors circulate that the island is haunted but it’s actually his psychic screams reaching distant boaters.


A race of devastatingly powerful, violent aliens turn out to be mental toddlers who don’t know what they’re doing and are just bred to think they’re playing one big game before they’re killed at age three so they don’t learn the truth


An alien spends a few centuries hanging from the parasitic tentacle of a much bigger alien, surrounded by millions of rotting corpses attached to its other moon-spanning tendrils. They engage in mental warfare until one finally absorbs the other completely.



It turns out another seemingly “evil” alien race is simply driven to kill and eat everything in sight because it was separated from its original world where food was continuous and the entire specie’s life is the torture of perpetual starvation


A peaceful robot willingly removes its inhibition against violence to help in the war, only to slaughter a huge number of alien-controlled humans so gruesomely that nobody dares think about or speak of it again and it is the only thing left undescribed in a book series that already describes entrails getting torn out and skulls getting smashed


A child stays too long in the form of a flea and instead of turning back into a human, accidentally turns momentarily into one big, giant flea that can only writhe and moan because it shouldn’t exist and can’t live at that scale.


The kids discover Atlantis, then discover that Atlanteans are inbred mutants who paralyze any humans they find, dissect them alive to figure out how their organs work, then stuff the corpses as kitschy museum displays for their children.


An ordinary ant gets transformed into a human child. It has no idea what’s happening and is so overwhelmed by its huge new brain and sensory input that it can only scream until it dies

8ucqfw,books,Halfway through reading To Kill a Mockingbird for the first time; this quote made me tear up,"“I wanted you to see what real courage is, instead of getting the idea that courage is a man with a gun in his hand. It's when you know you're licked before you begin, but you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what. You rarely win, but sometimes you do.""

I don’t know why it hit me. I’ve seen that kind of motivational shit spread around all the time, but just the simple way such a harsh truth was worded so succinctly and the way it related to that point of the story really made me think. I struggle with a relatively mild bit of depression, and a lot of the time I struggle to even leave my bed because what’s the point? It feels like anything I try to do is just gonna fail anyway. I think reading that quote was just what I needed at this exact time. Life can be shitty, and a lot of the time you don’t get the things you want, but you still have to be courageous and at least try a little. I guess I’d kinda lost sight of that until now."

I just picked up $68 worth of books for $00.90 (like new condition, they were being sold because no one was checking them out).

Over the past year, I've picked up over $100 worth of books for about $3 total. But beyond picking up discounted literature, your library probably does much more, such as:

-offering discounted entry to local museums/attractions

-holding educational/arts events for kids/teens/adults

-holding (free) small concerts for local musicians

-lending books between themselves to offer a greater catalogue to residents

-endless magazine and newspaper subscriptions

-free tutoring spaces (provide your own tutor)

-notary services

-access to the internet for those without, along with printing

-career services resources/ test guides

-citizenship test classes

-weird things your library wants to offer (mine offered kids fishing pole lending for a year... I can imagine why they stopped)

And I'm too excited; like, I want to suggest this book TO EVERYONE! Damn! 

Crichton originally wrote this book in 1969. And the most wonderful aspect of this book (apart from the brilliant story) is its scientific accuracy. Being in the 6th semester, we've come across almost all the topics discussed in TAS— Microbiology, Biochemistry, Enzymology, Biophysics, Immunology...and it is correct in its assessment everytime.

Another beauty is Crichton's ability to blend in fact and fiction in such a way that it would seem as if it is actually happening, in real time. At moments I held my breath for as long as 20-25 seconds.

If anybody is keenly interested in biological sciences, this is a book for them. It'll make you 'scared-to-death' (spoiler?).

Happy reading!

7qxtz8,books,Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. Making a memory that will last forever.,"I want to preface this by saying that my daughter will be 12 in a week and is fully capable of reading herself.  

On Sunday evening I was looking through books available on my daughter's Kindle for her to download and read at her leisure when I say that ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" was available for free.  I grabbed it quick and hoped that she would begin reading it soon.  Then the thought occurred to me, why not read it to her?  I haven't read a book to my daughter in years.  I read the first chapter and she was enthralled.  Having read the series myself years ago I knew what was going to happen and reading it aloud I am able to put the right inflections into the parts as they are needed.  And to say she's enjoying it is not even close.

Since that night I have read a single chapter to her each evening, sometimes staying up past her bedtime to ensure she gets the prerequisite chapter finished.  When we get to the end of the chapter she is begging for more.

As a parent I know that in the future when she is much older and has kids of her own she will think back to this time in her life fondly.  It warms my heart to know that I am making a memory that will last her lifetime and it is even more special because I know it now.

(Prime price is 20 bucks) What a deal! I thought, and soon after I ordered, I got that feeling of dread you get when you think that something may be too good to be true. I immediately canceled my order and looked at the seller profile. It was all caps with a name ""JAMESHALEY"" I believe, and their profile was just recently created. Their items for sale included pretty much the entirety of best sellers on Amazon. 

I did a quick google for JAMESHALEY and found a blog post detailing the scam. Scammers will open up new selling accounts, listing almost every book imaginable at an unbeatable price, knowing that due to Amazon's 1-click purchase feature, they will get a lot of hits. Of course the shoppers will cancel their order, but more than likely they will already have your Name, Address, & Phone #, which is what the scam sets out to accomplish. 

I immediately contacted Amazon about the incident and reported the seller. They sent me a swift response and even credited $5 for my trouble. So today I am browsing for books again and lo and behold, a different seller name has a great price, same situation. This is happening all over the site in different categories with more and more accounts being created everyday.

I finally decided to read it after watching Doctor Sleep and loving it.  Decided to read them both. I know Kings books are often pretty different than their TV or Movie Adaptions, but this one...wow.  It feels so shallow now. Jack in the movie feels crazy from the start, ready to murder his own family at the drop of a hat.

In the book, his struggle is so heartwrenching.  His desire to be a better man. To resist the hotel. Seeing him ultimately lose in the end, knowing it was coming because of the movie and Dr.Sleep of course, I still was like ""Please don't do it Jack, resist!"", I couldn't help myself.

It really touched me on an emotional level, Jacks internal monologues.  I don't drink or have kids, but it resonated with me so strongly, the feeling put into those.

Instead Kubrick made it a generic horror movie."

[Here's a link to every book I've read, feel free to ask me about any book in this list if you're on the fence about it.](https://imgur.com/a/sOwySVE) PS: the link works best in browser, not thru a mobile app! 

**Science Fiction**: 

*The Three Body Problem trilogy, Cixin Liu* -- This trilogy is always getting thrown out whenever asks for a good ""alien"" or ""first contact"" book, for good reason. I dont think any other book(s) goes such in depth when it comes to character development and global politics than these. The books span from the cultural revolution in China, to many centuries in the future. 

*Dune, Frank Herbert* -- I dont think I've ever read a sci-fi book so beautifully written. From the dialogue between the characters to everything else. This book was one of those books you enjoy to actually read more for the writing style than the story itself (not that the story was bad, it wasn't) similar to the book Lolita. I loved this book and wish it was longer. 

*Extracted Trilogy, RR Haywood* -- This is a time travel trilogy where everything is very easy to follow. Its not one of those mindfuck reads where you have to do extensive mental gymnastics to keep up with the plot. You will immediately fall in love with the characters and their collective humor.

**Fiction**:

*The Goldfinch, Donna Tartt* -- I enjoyed this book more for the characters than the story itself. Boris to this day is still one of my all-time favorite book characters of all time. I dont think this book is as good as Tartt's other novel ""Secret History"", but I enjoyed this one more. The movie is set to come out next month as well!

*The Great Alone, Kristin Hannah* -- This book takes place in the late 70s and is about an abusive Vietnam vet and his family and their quest to ""start fresh"" in Alaska. This is a relatively new book, having been published last year but out of all of the novels I've read, this was one of my favorites. Good character depth and a long timeline of events that dont feel rushed or glossed over. 

*The Wind-Up Bird Chronicles, Haruki Murakami* -- This is by far my favorite Murakami book. There's a part in the book where a general is telling a war-time story, those that have already read the book know what I'm talking about. Its one of the best parts of the book and a story within a story that has stuck with me since reading it. If you haven't read Murakami yet, this is a good place to start. 

**Non-Fiction**:

*Missoula, Jon Krakauer* -- You probably know Krakauer from Into Thin Air (worth the hype), but in this book he tackles rape, rape allegations and the legal process of rape within Universities, specifically Missoula. This book was very eye opening to me because it delves deeper into victims and their experiences. Before this book, all I knew was what was said on television about rape trials, basically he said she said, and the trials' verdicts. Reading this made me much more sympathetic to victims/accusers. Given the current #MeToo movement and the empowerment of victims to come forward, I think if there's one book you take away from this post, it's this one. 

*Tribe, Sebastian Junger* -- This author is the mastermind behind the famous documentary ""Restrepo"" that followed Army soldiers in the dangerous Afghan Korengal valley. In this book he focuses a lot more on returning soldiers, PTSD and how to better understand combat and non-combat veterans. This is a very short read (45mins - 1hr) but you come away with such a better understanding of veterans and their difficulty of readjusting to civilian life.

*Fall and Rise: The Story of 9/11, Mitchell Zuckoff* -- This book on 9/11 focuses less on the actual terrorist actions, and what led to those actions, and more on actual people impacted by 9/11. I have to warn you though, this book is extremely heart-breaking. You learn a lot about victims and their final days, their final actions and final moments of life. It's a gut-wrenching read that gives you a whole new intimate understanding of the suffering that went on that day and the days, weeks and years that followed. I've never cried while reading a book but this book was as close as I ever got to doing so. 

*No Place To Hide, Glenn Greenwald* -- Greenwald is the journalist who broke the Snowden/NSA mass surveillance story in 2013. This book covers the events of before, during and after his Snowden meeting in Hong Kong. He also goes into depth of some of the NSA spying tools, how they work and who they target. Its a very digestable book and you dont need to be a computer whiz to understand the programs he lays out. Greenwald is one of my favorite journalists and this book further cemented that for me. 

*The Anatomy of Terror, Ali Soufan* -- Soufan is a former counter-terrorism FBI agent who in this book details exactly how radical Islamists think, operate and specifically on the rise of the islamic state in the Middle East after the US invaded Iraq. He also goes deep into the sectarian wars between terror groups themselves (Sunnis vs Shias etc). This book gave me a better understanding of how from nothing in 2009, IS rose to power.

**Science**:

*A Crack In Creation, Jennifer Doudna* -- If you've heard of the gene editing method ""CRISPR"" and the many many medical benefits it can have for humanity, it is because of Jennifer Doudna, the scientist who in 2013 discovered that CRISPR Cas-9 has the ability to edit DNA. This book was really fascinating and very easy to read. You dont need to have an interest in biology or genetic engineering to enjoy the book. This book led me down the DNA subject rabbit hole and I wound up reading books on Paleontology, ancient human DNA from Neanderthals and Denisovans, to evolution and ancient life. If you want to learn more about the benefits of gene editing, this is the book to read. 

*The Hidden Reality, Brian Greene* -- Greene is a world-renowned physicist most notably known for String Theory. This book is a layman's introduction into String Theory and the multi-universe theory. Again, you dont need to have an interest in physics to enjoy the book. I have never even taken a physics class before reading this book and deeply enjoyed it. If you like watching youtube videos by PBS Space Time, you'll enjoy this book. Greene does a good job in laying out all the information in a way anyone can understand it. 

*Homo Deus, Yuval Noah Harari* -- If you've read Sapiens by this author where he focuses on who we are and how we got here and enjoyed it, then you'll enoy this book that focuses on who we're becoming and where we're going. A bunch of broad subjects are discussed in this book and you'll walk away having digested a bunch of information. He's a historian so we wont dive too deeply into a subject but you'll instead get a broad picture of it. 

**History**:

*The Road To Jonestown, Jeff Guinn* -- Before I read this book, I always thought of the Jonestown event as a mass suicide by a bunch of religious cultists following a crazy ass religious/socialist zealot. I remember watching YouTube videos on the event as well and forming my opinion on it from them. But there's just so much more to it. It gives you perspectives from former members, how they were either brainwashed or coerced to remain in the 'Peoples Temple'. How the vast majority of the residents of Jonestown were actually lied to and fooled to going to Guyana to how those that did not commit suicide were either shot or forcibly injected cyanide. A very powerful book with insight on how cults operate.

*The Billion Dollar Spy, David E. Hoffman* -- This book follows Adolf Tolkachev, a soviet engineer turned CIA spy during the cold war. For years he fed military secrets to his handler, secrets that saved the US over a billion dollars earning him his nickname and the title of this book. I had never heard of this man until reading this book but I'm glad I did. The man had massive balls and risked everything to do anything he could to topple the soviet union. 

*House To House, SSG. David Bellavia* -- Of all the war related books I've read, this is the most gripping and exhilarating one yet. Its a memoir written by Staff Sergeant David Bellavia that takes place during the height of the Iraqi insurgency in Fallujah. If you read this book, you immediately think ""bullshit, this doesnt even happen in movies, this is obviously fake"" because of how crazy the events in the book are. But they're not only 100% true, but were all captured on film thanks to journalist Michael Ware. It was just a few weeks ago too that the author was awarded the Medal of Honor, the highest military honor in the US, for the actions he took which he laid out in this memoir of his. Great read. 

*Man's Search For Meaning, Viktor Frankl* -- Frankl is a psychiatrist who was sent to a concentration camp by the nazis during WW2. He observed and noted the behavior of his fellow prisoners and saw how despite the horrid conditions they lived in, they continued to find meaning in their lives. This book is very powerful and it is also a short read given the book is 2 parts. You can make do with only reading the first part, the second part he does a deeper dive into psychology and logo-therapy. Many people on this sub have recommended this book and its with good merit. This is a powerful book. 


**Books that live up to the hype**:

*Harry Potter Series, JK Rowling* -- Dont ask me why I like these books. Im a 24 year old dude who could not turn away for one second after picking up these books. I owe an apology to all those kids I mentally judged as a kid because they were really into HP. I thought the allure of these books would be lost on me because of my age but that wasnt the case. If you havent read them yet, you should at least give them a chance. 

*A Song Of Ice And Fire, George RR Martin* -- I am very glad that I decided to read these books before starting to watch the HBO series. I loved these books and although it was challenging, for me at least, to get into Martin's writing style where he goes back and forth between characters, it became easier as I read on and started to catch on to the plot and I grew to like the style. I've expressed to my family how much I like this series so I'm looking forward to getting Winds of Winter for my 40th birthday. 

*Anything by Kurt Vonnegut* -- I've read about half a dozen of Vonnegut's books and havent been let down by any of them. They're a treasure trove of quotes and analogies. There are those who are contrarians and say he's overrated because of how much hype he gets but dont be turned away by them. He's a good author who deserves 100% of the admiration he gets.

*The Kite Runner & A Thousand Splendid Suns, Khaled Hosseini* -- I read both of these books my senior year in high school and decided to re-read them because I thoroughly enjoyed them back then. They were just as good as I remembered them. Hosseini gets recommended a lot on this sub for tear-jerking books and rightfully so. His books take place or have root in Afghanistan given hes an Afghan native himself and he gives good insight on what it is like coming up as an Afghan youth. Great author.

*Dark Matter, Blake Crouch* -- You probably already read this book for the off chance you havent, you should. Its recommended here religiously for good reason. You get sucked in from page one and the story is very easy to follow. His new book ""Recursion"" is also worth a look if you read Dark Matter and enjoyed it.

**Overall favorite book**:

*East of Eden, John Steinbeck* -- Out of the 250 books I read, I have not enjoyed one more than I have East of Eden. This was a very easy choice to make, about one third into the book I knew I was reading something special. The characters, Steinbeck's way of writing, the story-line, everything. There's a very good chance that no book will ever dethrone this one as my favorite and that makes me a little sad. Nonetheless, I am very glad that I read it. Its a beautiful book that I look forward to re-reading. 


I should clarify that the above list is just my very humble opinion. I have a certain taste in writing and information that the previous authors knew how to struck. I've included a screenshot to all 250 books I've read at the top of this post, [and here as well](https://imgur.com/a/sOwySVE). Feel free to ask me about any single one of them, I remember them perfectly and will to respond to everyone :)"

It was my first time reading it, also. He loves all things to do with knights, castles, and dragons so I knew it would be a big hit.

Over the course of two months, for roughly 30 minutes a night before bedtime, I acted out, as best as possible, the adventures of Bilbo Baggins and Company. I immensely enjoyed voice acting the various characters and could slip into Hobbit, Dwarf, Elf, Smaug, and, most enjoyably, Gollum at a whim. 

We finished last night and today I overheard my son singing the Misty Mountain song (I got several requests to repeat that part and I was able to sing it well thanks to YouTube). That experience brought us closer together and it warms my heart to know how much he appreciated our Hobbit time each night.

6gryh0,books,Modern libraries are awesome and deserve a shoutout!,"Last year, I moved to a new city and my first instinct was to pick up a library card from my nearest public library. It's amazing how they have changed with the times! 

My library has three media rooms, a 3D printer (plus classes to take on how to use it), a video production library full of equipment you can check out, a teen game room, yoga classes, small business classes and more. I was really amazed at how much of a central community hub it had become compared to my old public library which was still a bit older and dated. 

You can even check out a kindle while you go on vacation! You can preload books to read and take it with you. Simply return once you get home. Now I live on the road and constantly travel. I use their online catalog to rent ebooks onto my kindle. I literally have a library with me wherever I go! 

I can't overstate how much I love my library! 

Edit: I also wanted to add for those who don't have a kindle, you can download the kindle app to your phone or computer for free! That's what I did before I was gifted my current kindle :)

Double edit: Since some people are curious, my main library is Library21c in Colorado Springs, CO.

Last Edit I promise: User r/Fartin_Van_Buren pointed out to me that the Colorado Library System is set up to receive donations from smile.amazon.com. Just search under ""Pikes Peak Library District"". "

Four full length books are already out with JK Rowling's permission, all completely free!","The series itself features a fascinating new plot line related to but not dependent on Harry's adventures at Hogwarts. The protagonist is Harry's son, James Potter, starting at his first year at Hogwarts. The characters are a good mix of characters you know and their descendants, and totally new characters. The conflicts are much more multidimensional, with a lot more moral ambiguity and complexity, without straying from the plucky adventurous tone HP fans will love. The books also delve more fully into the theory and origin of magic, the international wizarding community, the history of magic, and the founding of Hogwarts. The writing style is evocative of JK Rowling without attempting to copy it, with a good mix of humorousness, classes, and childhood antics to complement the main conflicts.

It's available as an audiobook/podcast by chapter for free, and there are free PDFs of all the books easy to find on Google. Hope you enjoy these books as much as I have!

EDIT: As some people have pointed out, turns out there are actually FIVE books! Even better!
EDIT: To be clear, JK Rowling gave the author permission to distribute the books for free, but did NOT endorse the series as canon."
e028z1,books,"4 years ago my dad passed away, today I finally receive the first copy of the book he wrote and never dared to publish","First of all, my dad was in love with books, really.. Reading was his life. I didn't know that writing was a part of it too...

4 years ago, I was 22, he passed away. Few months after that my mom gave me a 150 pages of text and told me it was written by my dad and one of his guilty dream was to some day be published. 

It took me few weeks, maybe months, to finally read it, some handwritten notes from my mom was also in the text, it was like I was having a last discussion with my dad. I decided to do everything I could to publish it even at a really small scale. 

At the beginning of this year my mom passed away too (she never really recovered from the loss of my father), I’m sad that I never had the chance to offer her one copy of the book, but today is a big achievement in my life and I wanted to tell my story here and share it with you, because a lot of my motivation and energy came from all the reddit community, so thank you everyone here for being such an awesome community.

EDIT: WOW! You guys are all amazing! Thank you so much for the support! Thank you for your kind words! Thank you for the platinum, gold and silver!! 

A lot of you asked where you can buy it, for the moment.. nowhere I made some copies by myself! Next step is to find a way to publish it and propose it in store :)

I’m french so the book is in French so if anyone here speak/read French, I will be honored to find a way to send you a copy when I’ll have more available! 

Many of you asked for the synopsis, it’s a novel, the story of a boy who lost his father in an accident, and few years later her mom died because of sadness of her loss (yes. It looks like my own life I swear to god that it’s incredibly weird but 100% true) and the book is about the life of this boy and how he will fall in love with books, books will save and maybe destroy him at the same time. 

I’ll try to answer to everyone, thank you so much again for your kindness and support!

EDIT 2: I saw some people talking about sales strategy... I swear it’s 100% true. 
And I want to say something: everyone here who wants a copy will have one for free (maybe digital one because I don’t have a lot of copies..) I don’t want to earn money from this, your support and kindness already help me so much, you can’t even imagine"

&#x200B;

(Personal Bias) Its in the format I like.  I prefer blog post summaries to extended scientific debates.  I enjoy short stories over novels.    Its easier to make a small decent quality meal vs a four course entree which ends up boring you. I can put this down and go to something else rather easily. This book is not a 4 hour course at a specialty cruise.  It's a row of specialty snacks...loosely arranged in the order it wants you to partake in them. You have quite a bit of personal choice in how you want to read this.

&#x200B;

The short stories are engaging and have a nice personal touch to them.    The wide variety of individuals with different jobs, backgrounds, and personalities have actually reminded me of the book ""Working"" by Studs Terkel.

&#x200B;

The best stories are, of course, about the people not involved with the military(At least, during the initial spreading outbreak).  Zombie stories are best done like survivalist stories. That way you can make the behavior of the people actually believable and gripping!  Quite a few of the military stories involve absolutely idiotic behavior and planning.  Mindless zombies with no strategy have no real hope of taking on an organized military...so the only way to make them win is to give the commanders severe mental deficits.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Once you forget about the above...the stories are well written!    Humans turn into cannibals.  Humans bring their gamecubes they cannot play to remind them of home life perks.   People get saved.  I ""liked"" the story of the Martin Shkreli pharma guy who made the fake zombie vaccine and raked in millions.  People gradually turn into metaphorical monsters in order to fend off material monsters. A trope, but one which at least makes sense. Oh, and the ""individual outpost"" military stories are actually also well done.

&#x200B;

Oh, and it has its cheery moments too! People reminding others to stay alive and upbeat.  People going back risking themselves to save others.  After the ""victory"" life seems to go back to normal...albeit a vastly reduced population and quite different architectural standards to ward off zombies. I would love to see a drawup of the new ""anti-zombie"" architecture ubiquitous in every city.

&#x200B;

One of the few 5/5 fictional books I have read in quite awhile! If you didn't know in advance that the Zombie genre simply has never done the ""military vs initial outbreak"" successfully you may rank it lower.  Instead, you simply have to take that as a given. Engage your suspension of disbelief for some key common and necessary tropes and this \*actually\* ends up fairly realistic.

&#x200B;

Here is a nice quote.

&#x200B;

""In the beginning everyone was friendly. We cooperated. We traded or even bought what we needed from other families. Money was still worth something. Everyone thought the banks would be reopening soon. Whenever Mom and Dad would go looking for food, they’d always leave me with a neighbor. I had this little survival radio, the kind you cranked for power, so we could listen to the news every night. It was all stories of the pullout, army units leaving people stranded. We’d listen with our road map of the United States, pointing to the cities and towns where the reports were coming from. I’d sit on Dad’s lap. “See,” he’d say, “they didn’t get out in time. They weren’t smart like us.” He’d try to force a smile. For a little while, I thought he was right. But after the first month, when the food started running out, and the days got colder and darker, people started getting mean. There were no more communal fires, no more cookouts or singing. The camp became a mess, nobody picking up their trash anymore. A couple times I stepped in human shit. Nobody was even bothering to bury it."""

gz26ts,books,"I'm a 23 year old, straight man who has recently fallen in love with contemporary romance novels and I think that it is important for other men to try them as well. Here's why.","I didn't know quite where else to discuss this, but I needed to get off this my chest and felt this would be a supportive community. In recent months, I have felt increasingly down and depressed due to being closeted indoors, as many of us did due to COVID-19. Days melded together and genuine human connection had become next to impossible as everything went virtual. For an introvert, like myself, I was able to cope with isolation better than most, but I still craved something deep and emotional that I could not easily achieve. This led me down the path to try my first romance novel, specifically a book called ***The Kiss Quotient***, and I fell in love nearly instantly.

Like many men, I have been taught by society that we should generally suppress significant displays of emotion and let actions speak louder than words. This can be seen in nearly every form of media/entertainment focused on male audiences from books, movies, and TV all the way to advertisements.  I would always find myself overwhelmed by the overly masculine protagonists that kicked ass and who's entire character development never centered around their growth with another individual in a romantic nature. Romantic partners were often seen as a plus to have, but never a key component to the growth of the protagonist. For this reason, when a romance took place and offered itself as a core part of the characters growth, it felt refreshing and always made me feel much better as a result (there are so few examples that I can't even think of one off the top of my head even now). Eventually, I realized that there was, in fact, a genre that offered this satisfaction, but not as a side note, as the main purpose of the story: romance.

Similar to the stigma that men should hide their emotions, I always felt that there was this unsaid truth that romance novels just weren't for men and those who read them often did so privately out of the desire to not be ridiculed or look unmasculine. Similarly, romance novels, at least these days, are thought to simply be erotica which older women can read in public (looking at you ***50 Shades***). These misconceptions has prevented me from trying them for many years as a result, something that I now feel was a missed opportunity for many more years of pleasure reading.

The book that changed this, as mentioned above, was ***The Kiss Quotient*** by Helen Hoang. This is a story of an autistic woman who hires a male escort to teach her how to be a more romantic person and be more skilled at sex. Naturally, as the story progresses, they learn more about each other and fall in love, despite their difference in social class, wealth, and family trauma. What I loved about the story was not the world, which often led me to other genre's like fantasy, but the characters. While many books focused on male audiences often offer huge casts of characters which have minimal change over the story, this book and many of it's peers had a small cast which gave the writer a chance to highlight their growth on a personal level in greater depth in less time than in huge series such as ***Harry Potter***, where Harry has very little growth in 7 large books (don't get be wrong, I love the series, but I'd hazard a guess that like many others it was due to the interesting world and huge cast of colorful, albeit flat, characters).

I have since devoured several other contemporary romance novels, each time enjoying the emotional character depth present for the two leads. However, the ever present stigmas have prevented me, until now, from really discussing the novels with other people, which as many of you know is half the fun of reading anything. This isolation has made me feel the need to write this post. I feel that there are many others out there that, similar to me, really want something that can provide some emotional based story telling and I believe that romance novels can provide just this.

Now don't get me wrong, these novels do suffer from similar problems in representation regarding men that other genres have towards women. For example, while many TV shows, movies, and books show women as physical goddess that can have the emotional complexity of a hunk of wood, romance novels often depict men as physical machines that have muscles so hard  you could shatter concrete against them while also being gods at sex. This can be very disheartening for male readers, as they can have an inferiority complex and can give the impression that this demigod form is needed to find the emotional happiness depicted in the stories. However, I believe that this provides men a chance to understand and sympathize with the way many women feel about how they are represented in nearly everything else! The solution to improve this stigma in romance novels is the same one needed to fix how women are depicted: more male writers. This in turn can only be done if romance gains a higher male readership who would demand more accurate representation.

In conclusion, I feel that more male readers should give romantic novels a try. It's my firm belief that similar to me, many would actually find a new medium that can proved emotional satisfaction that is so often left out in other genres despite the fact that romance is something nearly everyone will experience at some point in their life. Further more, it has opened my eyes wider to the pressure that women feel in from other media to accept the idea that your physique is core to your happiness, and understand how degrading it can be.

Thank you to everyone that read this entire ramble. I have been needing to get this off my chest for some time and I hope that this gave you some food for thought.

**EDIT:** I really want to thank everyone for all their support and recommendations! It really has meant a lot to see. I have been trying to comment on as many things as I've had time to and I will continue to do so, but please excuse me if I don't get the chance to read what you have to say :(. Also thank your for my first ever gold reward!

**EDIT 2:** At the request of some, I've written a *TLDR*

**TLDR**; Men should try romance novels in spite of social stigma's against displaying emotion as they offer highly satisfying character growth, but also provide a means to experience the inferiority women feel in other genres which can yield much needed shift towards true character representation in all forms of media.

**EDIT 3:** I really want to thank everyone again for their support and suggestions! I just wanted to comment on something that many people have been recommending to me, which is to try watching romance anime and manga. I love romance anime and manga! One reason that I discovered my love of romance in general started when I watch the anime movie **Your Name**. However, as I pointed out to one user, the thing that pushed me towards American romance novels was a significant lack of physical intimacy that is present in Japanese story telling. This is a result of the differences in culture and simply comes with the territory, but as a result, few stories have intimacy present prior to the final chapters or episodes. Also since it was a key topic in my essay, I should also mention that many Japanese anime and manga don't really help with the issues of normal physique in regards to women and can often have some very sexist caricatures of women that I honestly have been getting tired of. That being said, I do appreciate the recommendations and am loving the discussions that are taking place in the comments section!"

[A poem by](/r/books/comments/2ysvzb/terry_pratchett_has_died_megathread/cpcp6bg) /u/Poem_for_your_sprog


The sun goes down upon the Ankh,  
And slowly, softly fades -  
Across the Drum; the Royal Bank;  
The River-Gate; the Shades.

A stony circle's closed to elves;  
And here, where lines are blurred,  
Between the stacks of books on shelves,  
A quiet '*Ook*' is heard.

A copper steps the city-street  
On paths he's often passed;  
The final march; the final beat;  
The time to rest at last.

He gives his badge a final shine,  
And sadly shakes his head -  
While Granny lies beneath a sign  
That says: 'I aten't dead.'

The Luggage shifts in sleep and dreams;  
It's now. The time's at hand.  
For where it's always night, it seems,  
A timer clears of sand.

And so it is that Death arrives,  
When all the time has gone...  
But dreams endure, and hope survives,  
And Discworld carries on.

Also, sometimes I don’t like the character or their storyline, but I have to read through it to get to the storyline of the one(s) I do care about, which are normally the ones I chose to read the book for. 

I’ve been reading Red Rising, the first three books were phenomenal. The author didn’t jump between characters, it was just the one characters POV and I loved it. Now on the fourth book, 5% in and there’s already three characters to keep up with! I only care about the one from the first three books, that’s why I decided to read the fourth!"

I hadn't read anything from this author. From the moment I started the book, it was awful, like a high schooler's first attempt at a novel.

I kept reading until I reached this paragraph: ""Maybe he hadn't gone too far. Maybe he wasn't in deep doodoo. Who knows, he might even get to screw her"" on page 8. I closed the book and can't wait to re-donate it back to the library - at least they'll make another dollar if it sells again.

Anyway, the point is I always see posts about people who want to know how far in a book they should read before giving up. My advice: when you're not enjoying it. That's when you stop. Life is just too damn short to read a book that you're not enjoying (unless, of course, it's for a school assignment).

Edit: alright everyone, I didn’t expect this much of a response. I’ve taken photos of every page (41) and I’m going to post it a little later. I’m going to answer some of the questions that I’ve been seeing a lot.

-He’s been keeping the list since he was a sophomore in college

-No he doesn’t have a favorite, he laughed and said there’s no way to pick

-he’s read a total of 2,891 (approx)

-The numbers next to the title is the amount read for that year, I think the max he read in a year was 71

-he’s reread about 10% of the list

-He was an editor at a newspaper

Edit 2: Ok, so here is every page of the list: https://imgur.com/gallery/pIpRZDk 

Edit 3: So there seems to be a lot of interest in a digital list. I'm going to work on getting this compiled into a spreadsheet and I'll work on some visualizations of the data as well. Keep a lookout over the next week or so.

It's a book related to discarding excess of material things from life and thus living a life that is more clear and fulfilling, which in my opinion is Minimalism. I recently took up Minimalism and so I wanted to check this book out. I heard a lot about this book in the last few months.

But by the time I was half way through it, it got so annoying that I just couldn't take it anymore.

There are actually two reasons why I quit this book:

1. The book starts by author telling (rather insisting) that hers is the *only way* to follow minimalism. (I tend to have trouble with anything that says their way is the only way to do something.)

2. The tone of the narrator was so annoying, she always had that overreaching self-centered pride in almost every single sentence.

Combine these both and it was a real irritating experience to listen to this book. So, I told myself: *fuck it,* and scrapped the folder from my phone.

Did any of you ever had this sort of experience with an audiobook before?

**EDIT:** I really hope and pray that the audiobook producers and voice actors out there come across our discussion here so that they get a greater awareness on our concerns, and work towards providing better quality audiobooks for us all.  Peace!"

Do the rest of you actually see characters and events play out like a movie when you read?,"So I recently came across the concept of Aphantasia and that others can actually form complete pictures from the descriptions given in books. This is probably a reason why I've usually preferred more visual mediums like video games, tv shows and movies. 

For me, reading books tends to be a continuation of one of those mediums, rather than the launching point of interest. For instance, I'm currently reading the Witcher series after playing the games and seeing the Netflix show.


So for those with the ability to visualize, does it just happen as you quickly as you read? Or does it happen more after the fact as you recall characters and events? 


Is this why people seem to get so upset because they don't like the look of actors that have been cast in certain roles? I've always felt its far more important to get the tone of the character than their appearance."

92rgsi,books,I just want to thank you guys for getting me into reading.,"I'm 15 and I hated reading so much. 

It seemed so boring to me and I was constantly getting distracted. I'd read a whole page but wouldn't understand anything I've read, and thought I hated reading. It turns out that I never hated it, I just wasn't reading the right books. 

Some time last week, I saw a post on the front page from this subreddit talking about the book, ""When Breath Becomes Air"", and how it was the first story that made someone cry in 15 years. I didn't believe you could actually be touched by books; the stories I was forced to read in school never made me feel that way and I assumed all books were the same.

Before I even clicked on the post, I checked it out at the library to see what it was all about, and I finished it in two days. I was bawling my eyes out by the end of the book and since then I've been hooked.

I found out I loved reading on my own, at my own pace, peacefully in my room. Sitting in an overcrowded classroom full of kids who didn't want to be there, reading 20 pages a day, and having to stop in the middle of a chapter just to answer questions about the character is the reason why kids think they hate reading. And it doesn't help at all that teachers pick the slowest readers to read the longest paragraphs in the book. 

I looked up must-read books on Google and this subreddit came up, giving me a whole list of books that people recommended. I went to the library on Sunday and picked up 4 more books that were on the list. Today I finished reading The Alchemist, and tomorrow I will read Brave New World. 

I never thought I'd ever enjoy reading on my own time, but now I can see why people love books so much. Thank you guys for recommending and discussing great books, and for reading my post! Have a great day! "

I have seriously started just skipping names that are gibberish. I applaud your intention to put us in a fresh new world where everything is foreign, I get what the purpose is, but we as readers still appreciate names that we can remember and be certain we are pronouncing right. 

Shoutout to Pierce Brown and his character names and terms in the Red Rising books. Easy to remember, pronounce and unique (Gorydamn, goodman, pulseFist, Ephraim ti Horn, Lysander au Lune, Valii-Rath etc.)

Edit: Some people seem to be misunderstanding my post. There are difficult to pronounce names. It’s a fact. My point, however, is that if you are an author and want your work to become more than fan fiction, using names that are hard to remember and pronounce goes against your goal. Is it acceptable for you that people don’t remember the names of the places and people you spent hours, days, or weeks fleshing out? It shouldn’t. Would you feel better if your readers saw the ridiculous names, and then made their own versions of those names, because your names are so outlandish, that the readers refuse to play along?

I've grown up watching the movies because my dad is a HUGE Tolkien nerd (translated Sindarin on his own lol). He read me The Hobbit when I was little, and I read the Silmarillion a while back on his recommendation. But until now, I'd never read the actual trilogy because I thought the movies were good enough.

I was so, so wrong. I finished the last chapter at 2am last night after a 6 month journey through the amazing world that Tolkien has crafted. In that time, the world has fallen apart, I was broken up with, left college, and I've been searching for where I want my life to go from here. Perhaps it's the fact that my own journey has been so hard during this time that the books hit me with such enormous emotional power, but I feel as though the world has been changed. Last night, as I said goodbye to the characters and world, I found myself crying. So much of their journey has been my own in these last 6 months, and I could never describe the joy and sorrow I felt as I turned those last pages.

There is an element of safety in fantasy, since you know it isn't real. But for me, the journey has not quite ended, and it is real. This trilogy has given me faith in a happy end, however. And I can thank Master Samwise for that. ""It’s like in the great stories Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered. Full of darkness and danger they were, and sometimes you didn’t want to know the end. Because how could the end be happy. How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad happened. But in the end, it’s only a passing thing, this shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer."""

It made me cry, it made me laugh audibly; I loved it.","The writing style was so fluid and I was so impressed at how well the story moved along even though the content could've easily come across as dry and too technical. It was also clever and hilarious. Also really enjoyed how he figured out the sandstorm, even when it appeared nobody at NASA would know how. I couldn't help but find myself very attached to his character and rooting for him tremendously from front cover to back. Mark Watney was a hilarious, relatable character that I always felt was brilliant enough to find a solution to any problem with which he was faced, though so modest that he barely gave himself any credit.

The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy might not seem like the sort of book you would find comfort in when life is a little rough but for me it shows how absolutely absurd life is sometimes, if not most of the times. The way Arthur reacts to his life being changed so dramatically while at the same time being made to feel so small and insignificant in a universe that is chaotic and outright doesn't give a damn helps to remind that this bad period too will pass. And that I shouldn't give up trying to have a good time while I'm still around.

Sorry if this is just random. I have the 'Ultimate Edition' and it was the first thing I picked up after all these things just happened to happen in the span of a couple of days. Reading it has made me feel better. Has the Hitchhiker's Guide ever helped anyone else during bad times? If anything, even after having read all the book multiple times, they still make me chuckle.

My mother and father divorced in 2010, this is when my mother began doing meth. She was in an out of jail a couple times and in febuary of 2013 my mom commited suicide in her jail cell. No letter was ever left. No final goodbye to her 14 year old daughter. Nothing just silence. I may have discovered the last thing my mother ever left to me. So get this... when my mom went to prison the first time she was there for 9 months. After she got out she gave me a bag of books to read. Books that might help me get why she was there.  Or things she thought i would love. She would read them and highlight specific passages in pink highlighter. Things she wanted to say to me but didn't know how.  One of those books was the house of leaves. It was nibbled on in the right corner and had some paint on it. I carried the book for a while but never read it due to its complexity. I sold it to half price books on hulen in 2014. Last week i went to the half price books in Arlington one I had never been to. I bought the house of leaves. And it too was nibbled on in the right corner and had paint. I shrugged it off doubting it could possibly be the same book. I started reading it and now I can't seem to stop. There have been more than a few coincidences at this point. I started skimming thru the book out of boredom... and I found passages highlighted in pink... and one of the passages read.. ""I took my morning walk, I took my evening walk, I ate something, I thought about something, I wrote something, I napped and I dreamt something too, and with all that something, I still have nothing because so much of sum'things has always been and always will be you.
I miss you."" 



It may just be coincidence however I'm going to believe that somehow she knew I needed comfort. And somehow she got this book back to me."

My 84 year old grandfather is writing a novel, and has asked me to help edit it and give ""candid comments."" I'm 100 pages in, and objectively, it's a terrible book. The writing is bad, the dialogue is completely unbelievably, as are the characters, the story is uninteresting, the chronology is all confused, etc. I have literally nothing good to say about it.

My grandfather is a very smart man (attended Columbia and Yale), and he thinks very highly of himself and his writing abilities. He refuses to take a writing course or join a writer's workshop (""Why would I do that? I know how to write!""), and I know that he's going to ask me about it, expecting a glowing review. And I don't know what to do.

On the one hand, it'll never get published so it kind of doesn't matter if I tell him it's great to make him feel good. On the other hand, he does want to write something good, and I don't want to completely lie to him.

Anyone out there ever experienced something similar, or have any advice? Much appreciated :)

Edits:
1. Holy crap Reddit, thanks for all the responses! I really appreciate all the input, and couldn't have ever imagined that this would make it to the front page of Reddit.
2. The book is about four boys on a baseball team who become friends, and the ways that their lives remain entwined in their adulthood.
3. Part of the problem is that my grandfather did publish a novel a few years ago, which is partly where his ego in relation to his writing ability comes from. It wasn't great, but it was better.
4. I think what I'll most likely do is a combination of your various advice: lie a bit about it being better than it is, then soften my main criticisms as much as possible. Again, thanks to everyone! "
eore0q,books,Having a library card as an adult is one of the most liberating feelings,"The Parks and Rec department staff would hate me for saying this but I don't care, I *love* the library. 

I work a typical 9-5 job, 40 hours a week and between work, going to the gym, cooking my own meals, cleaning my home, attending social events and all else, life gets busy so fast. 

Being someone that adores reading, having a library card is THE BEST. I don't always have the budget to buy a brand new book, or the time and energy to find a good epub version of my to-read books but the library is a place I can go to and get free books at my leisure, FREE. Most of the time I can extend my loan and have the books for over a month. 

I don't know why people don't read more, it shuts down my crazy mind and allows for another world, another view, to take over for awhile and to me, that's freedom.

That's what the library gives me, free books and freedom. Seriously, everyone should go at least once a month. It's therapeutic."
gvt82y,books,"Every time I re-read Walden, I get more frustrated about the sheer number of high school english teachers who assign it to impressionable youth without even understanding Thoreau's points.","I've read Walden four times in the last ten years. I re-read it whenever I feel like I need recentering or if I need something to take me out of today's problems (many of them today which caused my fourth re-read) and it upsets and frustrates me thinking of the thousands of high schoolers who graduate every year being unintentionally (or intentionally?) misled about the points Thoreau was trying to make by clueless english teachers.

**This part of my argument is anecdotal**: in all of the english classes in my high school, and even in music history classes at undergrad, teachers and professors so readily dismiss and mock the points they think thoreau is making when in reality it's not what he's arguing. Some examples:

'It's just cabin porn''He tells everyone to be self-reliant then has his mom do his laundry'

'He tells everyone that he lived alone in the woods for three years but he didn't'

'He shit talks college despite having a degree from harvard'

'He just wants everyone to give away all their stuff and hoe beans all day'

I could go on, but I think enough people get my point and remember these sorts of dismissive, snide remarks about Thoreau. The reality is: none of these were points Thoreau was trying to make, and the worst part is that the misunderstood points he was making are actually proving to be the root of the problems of today's society. He has a whole freaking chapter dedicated to talking about visitors, his preface tells people quite clearly that his intention wasn't to go three years without human contact (quarantine is showing all of us this would be unreasonable for us to expect of someone anyway), he let his mother do his laundry because they had a loving relationship and she wanted to help him, and you know why he didn't spend all three years in the cabin? Because he felt that it was unjust to hide in the woods while people were still allowed to own slaves. He left to help fugitive slaves in Concord because Thoreau was also a fervent abolitionist.

So what did Thoreau want? Here are \*my\* five biggest take-aways from reading Walden

1. He wanted people to live more simply. He thinks we get too attached to the 'surface' of things and never question what's beneath which leads to materialism and sensationalist news influencing our world to a negative outcome. Sound familiar?
2. He believed people should spend more time in nature. Not once did he preach that we should all go live like animals forever and eschew society - he argued that people would benefit from living in nature fronting only the bare essentials of life so they may return to society as better, more sensitized people. Living with nature, we see what matters and what's important \*cough\* climate change\* cough\*
3. He believed education needed reform and rethinking as its the most important part of a child's development. He believed retreating to nature for truth was the most direct route to de-colonizing and that educating the youth in nature and village rather than schoolhouse and university was the most wholesome way to teach children to think for themselves and be liberated from capitalism’s death-grip on the educational system. Maybe this is why high school teachers tell us all to think he's a quack because of the reality that the educational system has some pretty glaring weaknesses?
4. He wanted everyone to speak truthfully. ""Rather than love, than money, than fame, give me truth"" he didn't want frivolties - he wanted everyone to only speak with sincerity and from the heart. He didn't want to hear about news from Texas while talking to someone in Concord, he wanted to hear what someone's dreams and ambitions were and he wanted all of us to embody the truth and honesty in life rather than the gilded edges.
5. He believed the way our economy was set up kept downtrodden people on the bottom without time to better themselves, because if people on the bottom had the time to learn how to better themselves then the whole system would collapse resulting in a better world. Same argument is used today: the bottom percent is unable to get our of the bottom percent, so bad people stay in power and good people stay in submission because they need money to pay bills.

My point here is not to have everyone drop what they're doing and read Walden or get a Thoreau bust to kiss every morning. My point here is that I really \*really\* dislike the way Walden is taught to impressionable youth. I have friends from all over the country who have had similar experiences with Walden in high school, then I get them to read it again in their 20s, and they get similarly frustrated with how their teachers mishandled his book as a way to shit talk breaking away from capitalism and the less-rosy parts of modern life as something for nutjobs.

The reality is that we need Thoreau's ideas now more than ever. If we had listened to Thoreau, maybe life wouldn't be shit wall-to-wall in America right now. He was against authoritarianism, he was against rampant industrialization for the sake of industrialization (""If everyone lives a simpler life then who will build the railroads?! \[paraphrased\]), he was a firm believer in living with nature, and he was a firm believer that living a simpler, literature and nature- based lifestyle would lead to a healthier society.

You can think I'm a quack too if you want, but Thoreau was right about almost everything and today we suffer the consequences of decades of high school teachers teaching Walden to our youth without even understanding the point of it. I would like to end with a great quote from Walden.

“I learned this, at least, by my experiment: that if one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours.”

I want you to tell me who needs to hear this more than a room full of teenagers. But please, let's keep telling our youth that Thoreau the abolitionist and environmentalist was full of shit.

Update: hold your keyboard if you're going to accuse me of generalizing english teachers, you're just gonna make yourself look like a chucklehead. Who should I blame for Walden being mis-taught? The math teachers?

Update II Electric Boogaloo: To those thinking I'm making stuff up and this doesn't happen - the thousands of upvotes seem to say otherwise?

Update III: The Updatening: I want to thank those of you who have shared your similar experiences to mine. When this post was a wee lad a lot of the earlier comments were rather toxic towards me accusing me of making this up. To quote one of my favorites down below - ""No one, anywhere, in the history of history, has taught Walden in the way that OP is claiming, so OP is just essentially offended by, and responding to, their own idea. Just ridiculous."" So thank you for keeping me from successfully being gaslighted (gaslit?... Gaslighted...? Gaslighted. Yeah.)"
9it4if,books,I just finished reading all of the Sci-Fi on Reddit's 200 most recommended books,"I have always been a sci-fi fan, but it always bothered me whenever I saw a list of the best Sci-Fi (according to whoever) and I'd read (or even heard of) so few of them. Over the better part of the past decade I've collected names of books and notable lists of best Sci-Fi and have been slowly increasing the number of books I've read that are considered the best of my favourite genre. It's been great and I have no intention of stopping!

About 2-3 years ago I decided to take on [Reddit's most recommended Sci-Fi](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/wiki/fiction#wiki_science-fiction). There were several books that I'd already read, and a bunch I'd never even heard of, and since I'm a Redditor, and the list overlaps with a lot of other lists that I mentioned above, I decided I'd go for completion. Ultimately It's a partial completion, since some of the recommendations are for a full series and there are some that I only read Book 1 rather than the whole series, but with that one caveat, as of the other day, when I made it to the last page of *The Book of Ler*, I have officially completed the list!

I just wanted to mark the occasion by sharing some thoughts, joys, and disappointments with everyone here:

**A Fire Upon the Deep** Is an absolute stand out. I had no idea what to expect. I'd never heard of Vernor Vinge so it's one of those books that when I'd see it on a list, it just never stuck out for me. Basically, it blew my mind. It's rare to come across the perfect triple threat of world-building, plot, and characters but I don't think I'd be over-stating it if I said this one got high marks on all three. It is now one of my favorite books.

**Book of the New Sun** inspires ambivalent feelings. I read *Shadow & Claw* which is actually 2 of 4 books in the series. If I'd stopped after the first book, I'd probably have just written it off as not my thing/overrated and moved on, but I finished the second, and while it never fully drew me, by the end I was interested in finding out more about what was going on. I might read the rest of the series, but it holds a weird place for me where I have interest without enjoyment.

**Cloud Atlas** is a great example of interesting writing. I'm probably not alone in having difficulty staying immersed with the frequent change in setting, but I can say that once I got through the first half, I couldn't put it down. 

**The Mote in God's Eye** was... interesting. I wanted to call it out because it has some issues that I've been running into a lot with sci-fi from the 60s and 70s that's increasingly difficult to ignore. *The Mote in God's Eye* features a single female human who serves 2 purposes: to be a love interest and to explain (a super conservative version of) human reproduction to aliens. I guess I'm supposed to overlook that and just enjoy the story about aliens, but I have a hard time believing that in 1974 neither of the two authors knew what they were doing when they included a passage explaining why there were no women allowed on space missions.

**Red Mars** is just awesome. I can't remember if I read it before or after I committed to this list, but it stands out either way. It's a legitimate must-read in the genre and since I've read the trilogy, I intend to read more by Kim Stanley Robinson.

**The Saga of Seven Suns** is one that I was not familiar with (although I've read several books by Kevin J. Anderson) and wasn't sure what to expect. I only read the first book, but I'm definitely open to reading the rest at some point. There's a lot of world-building and it promises to be a large epic the likes of which you typically expect in the Fantasy genre. It's not my favorite on the list, but it's certainly enjoyable enough and introduces some interesting ideas about aliens and interstellar diplomacy. 

Thanks for reading my mini treatise :)

"
hup36z,books,I'm dyslexic so reading has always been hard for me. I read half of a book to completion for the first time in my life yesterday and it felt amazing.,"I'm 35 years old and have struggled with dyslexia and ADD my whole life.  Reading for more than 20-30 minutes at a time often becomes both physically and mentally distressing for me.  I often have to re-read entire paragraphs or pages because I was thinking about something else, or I will mis-read a word that changes the sentence and confuses the hell out of me.  My eyes will often cross or go blurry which can sometimes lead to headaches.  Because of this, reading an entire novel will typically take me weeks or months to complete. 

Yesterday I sat and read the entire 2nd half of The Eighth Guardian by Merideth McCardle in a single sitting and it felt amazing.  Her 1st person writing style kept my ADD in check as it was constantly on to the next revelation, or experience, without feeling hectic.  I was so thoroughly engaged in the story of time travelling spies that I immediately went and bought the other two in the series.  Dyslexia still reared it's ugly head a few times but I was able to power through it for the first time in my life. 

After feeling like giving up on reading so many times in my life, it seems that all it took was the right book to make me realize that I could do it too."

Ebooks added this way will sync across devices like any ebook you get from Amazon. 



Please ask questions in the comments below if you are having trouble figuring this out - I plan to edit the instructions as I find where folks are confused. 


# 1 - Find your send to kindle email address

First you need to find your send to kindle email address. There are two ways to do this on your kindle or on the Amazon website, it’s way easier to find on your kindle.  


**Easy way: On your kindle: Click the gear icon -> All Settings -> Your Account -> your send to kindle email will be listed on this page.**


Harder way: Go to [Amazon.com](http://amazon.com/) then click Accounts & lists-> 

https://i.redd.it/up315qw13h721.jpg

 


under “Digital content and devices” click “Content and Devices” ->

If you are on mobile you will see a gallery of images of kindles and app icons - click a kindle and you will see your send to kindle email address displayed below.  

https://i.redd.it/id3hyxh83h721.png

 


(Do not be alarmed if you see a shitload of devices listed, every time you download the kindle app on something it counts as a device - I have “devices” going back for many years of phones) 

Your send to kindle email address will be some variation on your name + @kindle.com



 

# 2 - Make sure the email you will be sending emails from to your send to kindle email address is whitelisted. If the email you send books from to your kindle is not white listed you will never get the books.

 

On [Amazon.com](http://amazon.com/) click “Account & Lists” -> 

https://i.redd.it/6uzd07wj3h721.jpg

 

under “Digital content and devices” click “Content and Devices” ->

https://i.redd.it/0sbp037l3h721.png




click “Preferences"" in the top bar of that page -> 

https://i.redd.it/33gegntn3h721.png

 

Click “Personal Document Settings” -> 

https://i.redd.it/xv33a2eq3h721.png

 

find “Approved Personal Document E-mail List” on that page -> make sure the email you will be using to send books to your kindle is listed there.  

https://i.redd.it/cyzhtkor3h721.png




# 3 - Let’s send a book.  

 

Go to a book on [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/search/?sort_order=downloads) \-> click either Kindle (with images) or Kindle (no images) to download the version of the ebook you would like to send to your kindle. 

https://i.redd.it/8r8zroxw3h721.png

 

Now open a new email message - fill in your send to kindle email address in the to field, then drag the book file into the email. Click send.  

Go to your kindle library and sync to make sure the book downloaded.  

I typically send ebooks to my kindle from my phone or iPad - you will follow the same process but often when you download a file your device will ask you what you want to do with the file - just choose email and send away.

jc1p93,books,“Atlas Shrugged” Really Isn’t All That Great,"Let me explain.

I’ve been reading about 50 pages of it a day for a while now, and I gotta day, it’s not all that it’s acclaimed to be.

It’s not that I don’t dislike the ideology, per say. I mean, I don’t prescribe to Ayn Rand’s world views, but that’s not the reason I don’t like it. In fact, I often really enjoy alternative perspectives in writing. It’s just that she’s so blunt about it. I dunno - maybe that’s the reason a lot of people like it! I just find it so unsatisfying to read two or three times a page about how great monopolies are and how much government sucks.

If you want me to believe what you’re writing, you have to sell it to me. What makes George Orwell so great is his ability to clearly state a message, yet also thinly veil it in symbolism and metaphor. It makes it feel genuine, not forced. Ray Bradbury does the same thing with “Fahrenheit 451”. The world feels natural, as does the message.

For “Atlas Shrugged”, though, it’s just not. The line between good and bad is so black-and-white it’s cliche, and not in a clever way either.  All the characters speak in the same way too. They literally sound like they’re all the same person. Furthermore, it’s not just that the characters sound the same; all the protagonists practically have the same features!

I’m going to describe a character, and you’re going to have to tell me which one it is: They’re gaunt, have steely blue eyes, and a cold demeanor. Who is it? You can’t tell me, can you. THEYRE ALL THE SAME. 

It’s really frustrating because people kept telling me how good this book was going to be. I usually love political-fiction. It’s my favorite genre, in fact. So why is this so terrible? I mean, I’ve kept reading because it’s so bad it’s almost kind of good, but then it just keeps going back to bad. I’m honestly disappointed."

I sometimes miss on essential information because of that and I have to go back when I finish reading a chapter to get a fuller picture of what just happened. Does anyone else do the same?

Obviously, spoiler tag anything  would be a give-away for others i.e the final message in So Long and Thanks For All The Fish.

A few for starters:

&nbsp;

* *The major problem—one of the major problems, for there are several—one of the many major problems with governing people is that of whom you get to do it; or rather of who manages to get people to let them do it to them. 
To summarize: it is a well-known fact that those people who must want to rule people are, ipso facto, those least suited to do it. 
To summarize the summary: anyone who is capable of getting themselves made President should on no account be allowed to do the job.* - A critique of political office as old as the office itself
* *The ships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don't.* - A great early example of the unexpected to come
* *He hoped and prayed that there wasn't an afterlife. Then he realized there was a contradiction involved here and merely hoped that there wasn't an afterlife.* - This one always seemed to show a great understanding of some of the illogical parts of modern idicum.
* *This man is the bee's knees, Arthur, he is the wasp's nipples. He is, I would go so far as to say, the entire set of erogenous zones of every major flying insect of the Western world.* - I don't actually know why I like this one so much!

Watching my youngest reenact the battles of Ragnarok was magical.,"I really like Neil Gaiman as an author and look forward to all of his new books.  I ended up getting Norse Mythology because I thought it might an interesting read and my girls saw it and wanted in.  We ended up reading a chapter/story every night and they couldn't get enough of it.  Last night we came to the ending story of Ragnarok and they were totally entranced.  I try and do voices and act out things when I read to them and my youngest took it a step farther by acting out the battle in her room while I was reading.  Experiences like this make being a parent special.  

I found that the writing was really easy to get into.  It felt like I was an old storyteller relating long lost legends to a new generation (which I guess I was).  I really hope that he decides to tackle other mythologies because I would love to be able to share more old stories with my kids.  

Edit: This really blew up and I am so amazed by all of you.  I ended up creating a Twitter account to let Neil Gaiman know about this post and he responded with a big thank you.  This has gotten over 134,000 views and my inbox exploded.  I will try and respond to everyone as I can.  Thank you to all of you for being awesome!!!"

""After Oswald, men in America are no longer required to lead lives of quiet desperation. You apply for a credit card, buy a handgun, travel through cities, suburbs and shopping malls, anonymous, anonymous, looking for a chance to take a shot at the first puffy empty famous face, just to let people know there is someone out there who reads the papers.""

I loved the entire book but after reading that passage, it really felt like conveying that idea was the justification for the entire novel. Has there ever been a passage that made you feel that way about a book?

bz0kn1,books,People who discourage kids from reading books for dumb reasons,"I volunteer at my local library, and I've seen this happening a lot. A kid picks a book, and the parents find a reason to give it a fault. Either it has too many pictures, or no pictures at all, or it's ""not your thing"", or it's too long or too short. It's even worse when they say it mockingly.

From time to time I try to intervene and say something in the lines of ""hey, I happened to have read this book with my little sister, and I found it really good"" to try to convince the parents to let the kid read the book, but I don't do that too often because no one likes strangers bringing in their unsolicited opinions. 

I started reading when I was 11, and it was the diary of a wimpy kid. I was going grocery shopping with my family and instead of going to the toys aisle with my sisters as usual I decided to take a look at the books (even though I had no interest in books at all). I happened to find the book cover interesting and was immediately hooked in in the first sentences. It was funny and easy to read. Five years later I was reading the picture of dorian gray in english even though it was my third language.

Everytime we see a kid with a book, we should let them know they're doing good. I would say there are exceptions, but those refer just to objectively bad books. Outside of that, there aren't many bad books, *especially* for kids. Let them read what they find curious, let them find joy in it and let their interest grow. I'm not saying parents shouldn't do anything, but at this age it's important to let kids have fun with such a healthy hobby."

I find that many authors are obsessed with small details that can take up 100+ pages that have no actual bearing on the plot.

Here are the books that I read and the days that I finished:

Turtles All the Way Down, John Green,  February 22

The Rules of Magic, Alice Hoffman, March 6

Americanah, Chiamanda Ngozi Adichie, April 19

Her Body and Other Parties, Carmen Maria Machado, May 1

The Power, Naomi Alderman, May 19

Dark Places, Gillian Flynn, July 10

The Hate U Give, Angie Thomas, some time in August

Unaccustomed Earth, Jhumpa Lahiri, September 3

The Child Finder, Rene Denfeld, September 4

Sourdough, Robin Sloan, September 7

The Vegetarian, Han Kang, September 17

Baby Teeth, Zoje Stage, September 22


Highlights: 

Americanah: This was captivating! Achidie’s sharp observations were really great to read. It took me a good amount of time but it was so enjoyable and worth it. This was probably my favorite in the list!

Unaccustomed Earth: Simply beautiful. This book was such a treat. Lahiri’s ability to write with such depth and insight about people and their relationships made this really stand out.

Low: The Child Finder. Ugh. I live in a small town. I had trouble relating to the commentary on small towns and their dynamics. Simply put, this book seemed a bit shallow and was my least favorite.
 
Not a low but a CREEPY: Dark Places & Baby Teeth. I could only read these during the day. These will probably stick with me for awhile. They were excellent and it helped having some thrillers on the list.

What’s next? Keep reading!! Who knows, maybe I’ll get to 18 or 20 by the end of the year. 

Did you set out on a reading goal this year? How is it going? Where are you at? What has stood out to you so far?

Edit: I am overwhelmed! This community is a HUGE motivator for picking up reading again and staying interested. Thank you for all of your insights and well wishes. I’m reading all of them and will try my best to respond. Let’s keep reading!! 

Edit 2: The dates! Hopefully this will clear up any confusion."

ea39m4,books,"If you have any books you'd like to donate, please, please consider donating to your local jail","I'm far from being a perfect person, and I've ended up in jail a few times in my life. As flawed as I am, I love literature with all of my heart. The books that I've read and loved have become a part of who I am, a part of myself which I nurture and cherish. Something that cannot be taken from me.

My first time in jail, I was terrified. I was 25 years old, in a new state, and doing 30 days. Jail is cruel and dehumanizing but most of all it's boring. It was such a relief to find that my county jail actually had a decent little library! I read at least one novel, sometimes two, every single day I was in that jail.

It was there that I discovered Gene Wolf's *Book of the New Sun*, now a favorite series of mine. I discovered Faulkner and Southern Gothic literature, something that I adore to this day. I read Steinbeck, outside of the scope of what they had us read in school. Reading was just about the only self care I was capable of in that awful place, and despite the best efforts of the criminal justice system, I left that place having been enriched; a more worldly and nuanced person than I was when I went in.

I ended up in jail again last month. At a different jail now, I was disappointed to find that this jail had a far smaller library, mostly John Grisham and Nora Roberts books and very little actual literature. Then I stumbled across a copy of Le Guin's *The Wind's Twelve Quarters*. I very nearly cried when I found it. Le Guin is probably my favorite author, and finding this collection of short stories was like a revelation that I would be ok, I'd survive, I wasn't truly as alone as I thought. After some digging I also found her Earthsea series, which I hadn't read, as I generally don't read much fantasy. Escaping into those books allowed me to escape my circumstances, and again allowed me to nurture that eternal piece of myself. I also had the pleasure of reading what was supposedly the first novel ever written, *The Tale of Genji*. I got to have a little bit of a reading vacation, in a world where you are expected to be crushed and humiliated.

Please, if you have books you'd like to donate, consider your local jail. The people in those walls are suffering, they are marginalized people, the very people who can be most profoundly impacted by good literature. You may be saving a life, and I guarantee that if you donate even just one good book, you'll definitely be improving one. There is nothing as powerful as a good book that gets you through a bad time."

The complete lack of individuality that would exist as no one is allowed to create or consume real art. The way we perceive reality is completely dependent on language... How we express ourselves... Orwell completely understands this and even knows how to explain it... This has really been bothering me!!!

85dipg,books,"Carl Sagan's ""The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark"" might be the most important book I've ever read.","I've always been an avid reader of non-fiction books, especially those tailored around philosophy, the human condition, and nature. Naturally, I sought out work by Carl Sagan from recommendations and glowing reviews along the way, and I loved his work on the TV show ""Cosmos:  A Personal Voyage"" (as well as the book of the same name), but I **never** thought I'd end up reading a book *dripping* with insight into so many topics that I admire (I just finished reading today -- took me two sittings as I just couldn't stop). 

From the importance of skepticism in all things (not just in science, but life in general); the failings of human memory (false memories, implanted memories, and the power of hypnosis); the dangers of all kinds of dogma (witch-hunts, the inquisition, New Age healing, fundamentalist religion); the baloney detection kit (i.e. understanding fallacious arguments, or sensationally fallacious media stories, that use ad hoc, ad hominem, straw man, appeal to ignorance, etc... elements); and how all of this (plus more that I didn't mention) ties into the need for continual support of science, education and a literate social class that can apply these, and many other important rational methods, into our every day lives (while convincingly elucidating the wonder and awe that is all around us -- collapsing stars, quasars, pulsars, the human genome, the vibrancy of life found on Earth, etc..). 

Sagan does this in such an easy to read, down-to-earth manner that makes every topic he speaks of so easily approachable (right down to explaining the general relation between Faraday's law, electromagnetism, and Maxwell's equations, and the profound impact a couple of equations has had on our society -- things that I never thought about, or read before).

This book has re-invigorated my wonder for humanity, and our capacity to grow as a species in the face of ignorance, hatred, war, and dangerous credulity. I honestly can't praise this work enough. "

7ydjhu,books,"If the decline of Barnes and Nobel depresses you, check out Waterstones, a UK book seller which is going from strength to strength.","Waterstones is an example of how to sell books right from a national chain. Their profits jumped 80% in 2017 and that's because physical book sales in the UK are a growing market again.

The chain looked much like B&N back in 2011 but was turned around but a new CEO.  His big plan? Decentralised decision making and going back to traditional book selling practices. Here's some key quotes from the rather detailed wiki page:

> In September 2011, the bookseller announced that it intended to drop its 3-for-2 deal on books after a decade in place.[48] The offer was replaced with a 'bespoke offer', based on branches choosing their own pricing structures from available discounts.[49]

>2013 saw the start of an overhaul of the company's business strategy, with centralised decision making giving way to store-based decisions and a renewed emphasis on traditional bookselling techniques.[69]

>Waterstones launched a number of new partnerships through the year, including with the University of Derby to launch a professional qualification programme for its staff,[73] with the Folio Society to extend customer reach and stock selection in London-based bookshops,[74] and partnering with a new charity, BookTrust.[75] 

>In a 2016 interview with Daunt, he stated that Amazon ""defines how Waterstones acts"" and while Waterstones could not compete with the internet retailer digitally, it could offer a credible alternative, believing there was ""a future in physical bookselling."" [97] Waterstones continued to look at ""fixing the basics"" during 2016, such as adjusting store opening hours and harnessing data from the loyalty card[98] as well as refurbishment of physical stores, including the Canterbury branch,[99] and work on its e-commerce routes through improvements to product ranking.

Essentially, the company lets individual stores have a huge amount of autonomy for a national chain. This allows them to experiment and work out how best to sell books for their area. What works in one area isn't the optimal for everywhere else. They see their staff's knowledge on books as a critical business asset. Through this empowerment, they have turned the business around from a potential blockbuster to a growing business, both in number of stores and profits.

Physical books are a growing market again but you need to adjust your business model to innovate and keep on top of trends. This could be a model that B&N could use to avoid being a relic of the past.

#### Edit 2:

I chose most of my books from TIME magazine's list of top 100 novels of the century. Others were recommended to me by my professors or peers.


#### Edit 3:
Since many have asked about some other goals I have taken. Here's a list of my goals for this year, which is similar to last year.

One of my main objective for this year to learn to get consistent, for which I want work towards my goals everyday, and not in bursts.

Some of my goals for this year along with their daily targets are:

- To learn French good enough to read and speak with a bit of fluency by the end of the year. For that I am practicing it daily.

- Practice piano every day for at least an hour. Currently I am learning Claire de Lune, so, just want to finish learning it. Then record it and a piece by Chopin as soon as possible. As of now I haven't set my final goals for this year, just want to keep practicing.

- Read 60 to 70 novels by the end of the year for which I read a novel for at least an hour daily.

- Workout daily

#### Edit 4:

Many people seem to get an idea from my (bit misleading, which I can't edit now) title that I am now cured of depression. Which I already clarified in the post. To be clear, I still get depressed. But I have just found a way to not let it paralyze me like it used to earlier. I kept myself busy for the same reason. Hope this clarifies things a bit.

I don't claim that this is a cure for depression, I am just trying to learn how to live with it, and the thing is, it seems to work for me. People should learn to understand that what I have posted is an observation. What you interpret from it is left to you."
d4p5sp,books,"Agatha Christie was born today, 129 years ago. 8 years ago, a pretty girl and I flirted over dinner, plotting and one-upping each others (and Christie's) outlandishly complex homicides. We'll be engaged soon. We like to say we bonded over murder. Happy Birthday, and thank you, Dame Agatha.","My first Christie was ‘Murder On The Orient Express.’

I was 11, and, early one morning, helping a friend and his family move into his new place. The previous tenants hadn’t cleared out everything, including this huge, stinking old mattress on the 1st floor (that’s the 2nd floor for people from civilisations that haven’t yet unlocked the metric system technology). We tossed the ugly thing out of the window.

And there, hidden for god knows how long  between the fetid foam and splintered bed slats, was this slim and sorry looking paperback.

At that point I already fancied myself a ‘mature’ reader of refined tastes, having ploughed through about 80 volumes of the Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew mysteries, and ready to complete another 60 over the summer break.

Honestly, I was glad to find an alternative. It was beginning to strike me that I was increasingly frequently being able to predict exactly what was gonna happen to Frank and Joe and Nancy. It was like those books were formulaic or something.

Around 10am my friend’s parents ran out of things to give me to do., so they fed me some KFC and turned in to nap.

No one was expecting me anywhere, so I found an empty hammock at the playground and began to read. I remember hoping I’d find a racy scene or two.

I didn’t move for the next eight hours. Sun was pretty much about to set, and my bladder was about to burst. I whizzed into a large drain and walked home in a bit of a stupor. I honestly can’t remember any earlier instance of having my mind well and truly fucked.

No one’s seen me in eight hours, so they were just about to start getting worried.  I don’t think I really listened to the chewing out I got.  At some point Mum told me to go bathe before dinner.  I remember them knocking on the bathroom door, asking me if I was getting married or something coz I’d been in there for 20 minutes. I hadn’t even soaped myself.

At dinner I’m still spaced out so Dad finally asks wtf  is wrong with me and where’d I’d been.  I asked him if he’s ever heard of someone called Agatha Christie.

He, Mum and Gran all ask why at the same time.

I tell him she’s an author, and I’d spend the day reading a novel she wrote, and that she’s got about sixty more, and that I was done with those dumb Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew, and that she was the only author (other than Rowling) that I wanted to read anymore, and that it was the best book ever written, and that if they hadn’t read it then I was gonna make them, coz they didn’t know what they were missing out on, and then I went on to spell out and spoil the whole plot for them.

They politely wait for me to finish before they start sniggering. Gran tells me I’m obnoxious, and Mum’s starting to laugh her head off, and Dad takes me to the master bedroom, to the bookshelf he shares with mum (which up to this point I’ve entirely ignored because I’ve got my own bookshelf and it’s way more interesting), and tosses down five more Christies and says I can keep them.

I remember being amazed at the sheer coincidence that he’d have books by an author I stumbled across so randomly. It’d be a few more years before I realised that  the only one who’d outsold Christie was Bill Shakespeare, and that’s coz he had a 300 year headstart.

So it turns out Mom had been reading Christie since she was 16, Dad since 14, and Gran had been reading regional translated copies of Christie since she’d been 15 back in 1951.

Dad asked me to add the book I found to my library before I forgot. Way ahead of you, Dad, coz I just then realise I forgot it in the hammock.

Five minutes later I’m back at the hammock, nearly throwing up from sprinting on a full stomach. The book was gone. Not in the hammock, not near the drain, or at any point on the way home. Crushed, I was. Gran does her Gran thing and says that was probably what that copy’s fate or purpose was: to bounce from unwary reader to unwary reader to introduce them to Christie just like  it introduced me.

Yeah, nice story Gran, but fine, I’ll play.

I’m pretty sure I’m the only one of us who has read every single one of Christie’s murder mysteries though.

That was 19 years ago. Then, 8 years ago Christie served as the best wingwoman I ever had.

And earlier this morning my girlfriend and I were telling a mutual friend (who hadn’t read any of the books) what Christie meant to us. She seemed intrigued, and so my girlfriend and I are gonna buy her a book each. 

My girlfriend’s serving up ‘Death on the Nile’, and obviously, it’s ‘Murder On The Orient Express’ from me.

EDIT: Well, this became a thing overnight. What a wholesome and cool bunch you all are! Love you guys! Much gratitude for the gold, anon Redditor. 

A: Much gratitude for the many many engagement-to-be congrats. I guess this makes you guys the first to congratulate us, so you're all special to my gf and I now.

B: To those inspired by this post asking for Christie recommendations, check this list of my favourite dozen. If you like working up to the greatest stuff, read these in ascending order; read in descending order if you like starting with the greatest.

>Murder on the Orient Express 

>And Then There Were None

>Death on the Nile

>Evil Under the Sun

>Cards on the Table

>Nemesis

>Towards Zero 

>N or M?

>Appointment with Death

>A Murder Is Announced

>Taken at the Flood

>The A.B.C. Murders

C: To those saying this belongs on r/nobodyasked: Firstly, this was the only Christie-related post on Christie's birthday. Secondly, this subreddit isn't just about talking about books; it's also about how you relate to them. So the fact that this sub exists and we're all here... well... r/everyoneasked.

D: To those saying I'm a shit/obnoxious writer: I agree, if you're saying I'm have an incomplete sense of finesse or technique. But if you think writing well has nothing to do with creating a certain reminiscence-y mood or touching folks with the feels, then y'all don't know what you think you know it means to be a writer. Whatever. Beauty in the eyes of the beholder and all that.

E: For those asking for recommendations of writers 'Similar to Agatha Christie', there aren't any, but I've got two for you anyway. If Christie's 'hook' was **'Whodunnit?'** then these two authors had 'hooks' of their own:

> James Hadley Chase. His hook is ""What happens next?"" He did for general crime - robbery, kidnapping etc - what Christie did specifically for murder. Also, his stories are told from the criminal's POV.

> Erle Stanley Gardner's Perry Mason Series: His hook is ""GUILTY or *Innocent*?"" Dramatic courtroom pulp.  These are a bit of a guilty pleasure because they're most sensational and lurid things you'll ever read.

> Bonus: Sherlock Holmes, obviously, but I'd be amazed if people didn't know who that was."

Typically I show love by reading people the book... as it was read to me by the first person I fell in love with. So, as a gift to him I recorded myself reading it so he could listen to it while he’s away. Only took 10 hours, one minute, and 45 seconds. 

Please don’t rat me out if I’ve broken copywriter laws! It’s not for profit!!!

EDIT: thanks for the awards! I shall sit on my pile of gold and silver like Smaug on his - and relish it for evermore!!

Now, to those of you who have seemed to take such an offence that I read a book to him that I was read by an old boyfriend. Sorry you’re miffed. But that was 25 years ago and I’ve read the book (or parts of it at least) to lots of people - including my own kid. The ex’s parents used to read it to he and his brother, he read it to me, I’ve read it to others, I hope my son will read it to people. It’s a nice book to have read to you - it’s not a once in a lifetime opportunity. 

And, for the record, this guy knows how much the book has figured in my life, and that I’ve read it to others as it was read to me. And it wasn’t an issue. I, in fact, started reading it to him as he fell asleep one night and that’s when I thought I should record it so he could take it with him. My friends who know about the little project want a copy too. It’s a sweet gesture, not an original or sacred one.

EDIT TWO: many of you are asking how I recorded myself - I downloaded the app “Dictaphone” to my iPhone (but I’m sure android has a similar version). It was a pretty easy app to navigate and I’m pretty low tech). I recorded it chapter by chapter - some were ~10 mins, others ~50. Then I uploaded the files to my google drive and put them on a flash drive which I’ll give to him before he goes. And I’ll tell him about all this hoopla. He’ll think it’s funny - and in some cases, unwarranted. 

I’d recommend if you want to try something similar to do a dry run with each chapter of whatever book you’re reading - I think that would have made me goof less as it would have been fresher in my mind and in how the words flow. Granted that would at least double the time it takes to do any project. 

EDIT THREE: he really loved it. He thought it was the sweetest thing ever. And he thought people who had issue with it were dead wrong."

 Now to be clear if you if read only non fiction because fiction doesn’t entertain you then that’s fine. But if you are reading books for the sole purpose of bettering yourself then I feel these people are really missing a big opportunity  by not reading fiction. 

For me personally I get facts from non fiction books and fiction helps me improve my empathy and abstract thinking. 

Would love to hear everyone’s take on this!

Edit: whoa I did not think this would get as much traction. I think my point is getting misconstrued. This isn’t a post judging  people on what they read. I’m talking about the logic some people use for not reading fiction. That some people only read the self helps, finance books because they are looking for a direct benefit in their life such as being more likable or having more money.
I’m just trying to show with this logic you can also get a direct benefit from reading fiction as well.

7h2cce,books,One of my favourite passages in Kurt Vonnegut's [Slaughterhouse 5]," ""It was a movie about American bombers in the Second World War and the gallant men who flew them. Seen backwards by Billy, the story went like this:

American planes, full of holes and wounded men and corpses took off backwards from an airfield in England. Over France, a few German fighter planes flew at them backwards, sucked bullets and shell fragments from some of the planes and crewmen. They did the same for wrecked American bombers on the ground, and those planes flew up backwards to join the formation.
The formatioin flew backwards over a German city that was in flames. The bombers opened their bomb bay doors, exerted a miraculous magnetism which shrunk the fires, gathered them into cylindrical steel containers, and lifted the containers into the bellies of the planes. The containers were stored neatly in racks. The Germans below had miraculous devices of their own, which were long steel tubes. They used them to suck more fragments from the crewmen and planes. But there were still a few wounded Americans, though, and some of the bombers were in bad repair. Over France, though, German fighters came up again, made everything and everybody as good as new.

When the bombers got back to their base, the steel cylinders were taken from the racks and shipped back to the United States of America, where factories were operating night and day, dismantling the cylinders, separating the dangerous contents into minerals. Touchingly, it was mainly women who did this work. The minerals were then shipped to specialists in remote areas. 
It was their business to put them into the ground, to hide them cleverly, so they would never hurt anybody ever again."""

bzd5w6,books,Has anyone ever noticed how certain male authors talk excessively about their female character's breasts?,"I just started reading *Altered Carbon* by Richard Morgan, and I noticed how the introduction and description of one of the characters seemed to revolve around her breasts.

>Exuberant breasts strained the fabric of the leotard.

-

>She stood facing me, flushed, breasts rising and falling distractingly.

-

> Mrs. Bancroft’s breasts jiggled with her steps under the thin material of the leotard, and I took a morose interest in the art on the other side of the corridor.

I know it's because the author is trying to portray the though process of the main character, who is obviously focused on this woman's breasts, but it struck me as kind of funny, like ""Then a pair of breasts walked into the room. A head located somewhere above and slightly behind the breasts started saying something or other, which caused the breasts to jiggle a little bit!""

I thought about it and I've noticed that Stephen King sometimes does this too. I remembered when I was reading *Pet Sematary*, thinking it was weird how he kind of randomly started talking about an old woman's breasts:

> It occurred to him that once she had been seventeen, her breasts eyed with great interest by the young men of the neighborhood, all her teeth her own...

Then I wondered how often he talked about breasts in *IT*, so I decided to take a look:

>He struggled halfway up, leaning toward it, and then felt one of Beverly's breasts press against his shoulder as she reached over him to get it.

-

>He stood there for a moment, staring at her as if he had never seen her before. In a way he never had. Her breasts heaved rapidly.

-

>And suddenly—maybe it was because of the utter loathing on her face, the contempt, maybe because she had called him a tub of guts, or maybe only because of the rebellious way her breasts rose and fell—the fear was suffocating him.

-

>It was this latter Beverly who swung the belt for the last time—the belt he had used on her buttocks, her legs, her breasts.

-

>They are in bed together during this conversation. Her breasts are small like peaches, sweet like peaches.

-

>Her hands were folded just below her breasts, as if in prayer.

-

>She clasped her hands together between her budding breasts, fluttered her eyelashes rapidly, and then laughed.

This is where I got bored of this exercise and stopped looking - I was only 30% of the way through!!

So, has anyone else ever noticed this with any authors?

Edit: to the ~500 people who've said ""big surprise, men like boobs"", the point is that I like my characters to have depth. I want my female characters to be more than a pair of boobs walking around the room and I want my male characters to see female characters as more than a pair of boobs walking around the room."

hy2ngv,books,Why You Should Not Read More,"Reading more is a good goal, always. However, the way that I've seen ""reading more"" being discussed, especially on the internet is...just not good. The advice that people give on ""how to read more"" is almost always terrible, such as speed ""reading"", audiobooks, skimming etc. And these are fine methods when, say, you have to go through a textbook for a test and you don't have enough time, but for reading in general, as an activity, it's just bad.

It's almost as if reading has become an intellectual status symbol in the society, and the more books you read, the smarter you are perceived to be. So the end goal is to just read as many books as you can, without regard to the enjoyment and the actual reading experience.

You'd never find a cinephile saying ""Yeah, I generally skip over some parts of film to get to the meat and like read the Wikipedia summary to help, that's just so that I can watch as many films as possible.""

People forget that at the end of the day, reading is a consumptive activity. Can it, in general, be more demanding than other consumptive activities like watching films and listening to music? Yes, absolutely. But it's still a consumptive activity, so applying the kind of strategy that one applies for doing productive work -- like how to study more, how to work more, how to practice more (an instrument, for example) is not good, in my opinion.

The best experience is to go through a book slowly. Read each and every line, and let it settle in your mind. If you like a sentence/para, or if you don't fully understand it read it twice, thrice. It's better to closely read one book per year than to skim over a hundred.

What do y'all think?

EDIT: With respect to my point about audiobooks (including some of the comments), I apologise. I realise I have been insensitive towards certain groups, and that I need to educate myself better on their experiences, the problems they face and evaluate my own privilege. I'm sorry."

I sat down at the beginning of quarantine and finally started reading Fellowship very seriously, making sure I took it slow and read very closely. There were definitely parts of these books that I was more than a little bored throughout, but the parts that grabbed me REALLY grabbed me!

I had to take a good amount of breaks for a few weeks at a time, and once I even thought there was no way I was going to finish just cause it felt like way too big of a feat. So glad I pushed through cause the payoff was IMMENSE! I read the last 150 or so pages in one sitting which was so rare for me with these books. So happy I pushed through and took the time to read them, even with all the lulls I completely understand why they're held in such high regard, and everybody should give them a shot if they haven't!

Also, if you're struggling to get through a long book or series, it's totally okay - put the book down for a little bit, move on to something else, but come back to it. You'll find that a bit of a break is a really good refresher!

8ojp4y,books,A few lessons I've learned from reading 3 books about slave labor camps,"5) Humans Can Survive In Horrible Conditions

>“Like nearly all the camp inmates I was suffering from edema. My legs were so swollen and the skin on them so tightly stretched that I could scarcely bend my knees. I had to leave my shoes unlaced in order to make them fit my swollen feet. There would not have been space for socks even if I had had any. So my partly bare feet were always wet and my shoes always full of snow. 

— “Man’s Search for Meaning” Pg 27

The quote above comes from Viktor Frankl as he explains life at a Nazi concentration camp. He suffered from edema, which caused his tissues to swell up and made moving around torture. His feet were uncovered as he walked through snow and didn’t have a pair of socks–not that he could wear them anyway because his shoes were already tight due to his swollen feet. With barely any clothes or gear, he and others were still forced to mine the frozen ground for ten or more hours a day. 

The only nutrition prisoners were given was a bowl of very watery soup once daily and a small piece of bread. Sometimes they were given special extra allowances consisting of a piece of cheese or a slice of poor quality sausage. 
 
Life wasn’t much better for Alistair Urquhart at the Japanese labor camps. He was given only a cup of rice and water for each meal. From constantly working in the jungle with no shoes, he developed tropical ulcers. There was a doctor in his camp but he didn’t have any medicine so the best advice he gave Urquhart was to put maggots on his foot to eat the dead skin. 

As crazy as it sounds, it’s true:

>“I left the medical hut, shaking my head, still wondering if I were being had. Letting maggots eat my skin did not sound particularly appetizing but I was willing to try anything. I knew I had to stop the rot that was devouring my legs.” 

— “The Forgotten Highlander” Pg 171

And the craziest part is it actually worked. However, Urquhart said that even years later he would sometimes get the sensation of maggots eating his skin. An unfortunate side effect, but he did live to be 97 years old. 
Alistair Urquhart, author of ""The Forgotten Highlander.""

4) Survival Requires The Right Mindset 

>“‘It’s easy for these men to give up and when they lose hope the fight just seeps right out of them. On countless occasions I have seen two men with the same symptoms and same physical state, and one will die and one will make it. I can only put that down to sheer willpower.’ 

— “The Forgotten Highlander” Pg 170 

Urquhart writes that he could tell which men would die by simply looking at their faces. Those with a lost gaze in their eyes didn't last long. It was in that moment that Urquhart made the decision that he would not stop fighting–even if it required him to put maggots on his feet to survive. 

Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn learned a similar lesson. 

>“And the conclusion is: Survive to reach it! Survive! At any price!... This is the great fork of camp life. From this point the roads go to the right and to the left. One of them will rise and the other will descend. If you go to the right–you lose your life, and if you go to the left–you lose your conscience.  

— “The Gulag Archipelago” Pg 302

Solzhenitsyn notes that prisoners had to make a decision, do whatever it takes to survive or fall short and die. This didn’t mean kill other people to survive, but rather it was a change in mindset. 

In his book, Solzhenitsyn writes that prisoners were allowed to take baths–with only cold water–but then had to endure a trip back to camp in subzero temperatures. Yet, none of them got pneumonia, in fact, they didn’t even catch a cold. 

However, when one of those prisoners was finally released and he could live in a warm home and take warm baths, he got ill the first month. The mindset of surviving at any price was not there anymore. Changing one's mindset can have an incredible impact on the rest of the body. 
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, author of ""The Gulag Archipelago.""

3) Slave Labor–You Get What You Pay For

>“We made constant attempts at sabotage. Men whispered orders to impair the construction of the bridge wherever possible. Some charged with making up concrete mixtures deliberately added too much sand or not enough, which would later have disastrous effects.  

— “The Forgotten Highlander” Pg 188

Evil leaders have been under the assumption that slave labor is a great way to accomplish projects at little to no costs, but this is far from the truth. As Urquhart writes in his book, the prisoners did everything in their power to delay or destroy the project. They even collected termites and white ants and deposited them into the grooves of the logs that were meant to hold up the bridge. As a result, construction projects were often delayed or if it were finished, the quality of the project was extremely poor and didn't last long.

A similar conclusion can be found in the Soviet labor camps.

>“All they were on the lookout for was ways to spoil their footgear–and not go out to work; how to wreck a crane, to buckle a wheel, to break a spade, to sink a pail–anything for a pretext to sit down and smoke.  

— “The Gulag Archipelago” Pg 293

Just as in the Japanese camps, workers would constantly find ways to sabotage the project so they didn’t have to work. Solzhenitsyn adds that the material was so poor, people could break bricks with their bare hands. 

The prisoners did everything possible to quietly foil the project so that they wouldn’t have to work–after all, they weren’t being paid to work so they didn’t have any incentive to do so.

The prisoners were also constantly stealing project materials. Solzhenitsyn concludes the chapter by writing that the labor camps were not only ineffective, but they ended up costing the country more than if they had simply paid workers a fair wage. 

&nbsp; 

2) Life Is Unfair

>Viktor Frankl worked at a hospital as a psychiatrist, before being arrested and sent to four different concentration camps over the years.  
>Aleksander Solzhenitsyn was a decorated captain in the Soviet Army during World War II before he was arrested and sent to a labor camp for criticizing Stalin in private letters. 
>Alistair Urquhart was drafted into the army during WWII and shipped to the British outpost of Singapore before he was arrested by the Japanese and sent to one of their labor camps. 

 

None of these men were “evil” or actual criminals. They were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. None of them deserved to suffer in the labor camps. None of them should have worked 16 hours a day of physical labor on barely any food or water in horrific conditions.

Life is simply unfair at times. Viktor Frankl does, however, offer a piece of advice should anyone find themselves in a similar situation. He writes that everything can be taken from a person, except their attitude. 

>“Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms–to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way...It is this spiritual freedom–which cannot be taken away–that makes life meaningful and purposeful. 

— “Man’s Search for Meaning” Pg 66
Viktor Frankl, author of ""Man's Search for Meaning.""

&nbsp;

1) Man is Capable of being a Saint & a Swine

>“In the concentration camps...we watched and witnessed some of our comrades behave like swine while others behaved like saints. Man has both potentialities within himself, which one is actualized depends on decisions but not on conditions. 

— “Man’s Search for Meaning” Pg 134

That is a heavy truth to swallow. Even in the concentration camps, Frankl noticed some prisoners gave their daily piece of bread to prisoners in dire need of nutrition. He also saw other miracles such as a Nazi doctor buying medical supplies with his own money and smuggling it back into camp to help the Jewish prisoners. 

Frankl ends the book by saying that man is capable of inventing the gas chambers of Auschwitz, but man is also the same being that entered those gas chambers with the Lord’s prayer on their lips. 

Solzhenitsyn came to a similar conclusion in his book.

>“Gradually it was disclosed to me that the line separating good and evil passes not through states, nor between classes, nor between political parties either–but right through every human heart–and through all human hearts.   

— “The Gulag Archipelago” Pg 312

Solzhenitsyn spent countless hours thinking in prison–when he wasn’t being forced to work, prisoners sat in their cells and had nothing but their hands and their mind–and came upon the realization that good and evil exists inside every person, but they must make the decision within themselves. 

Inside every person is the struggle between good and evil, and although it is impossible to expel evil from the word, the next best thing is to constrict it within each person. That is a responsibility that falls upon each and every one of us.

8ut9rl,books,Books are keeping me alive,"I have been severely depressed for many years now and have done extensive planning surrounding Suicide . A few weeks after my most recent attempt I was walking around in a book store and saw the Ray Bradbury quote ‘‘You don’t have to burn books to destroy a culture. Just get people to stop reading them. ’’ This got me thinking that it would be a terrible thing to leave my beloved books unread. I made a deal with my self that I could not attempt again until I read all my books. This transformed my life. It made it so that when ever I started working on plans to kill myself I would remember that I had so much reading to do, this would sometimes pull me out or at least take enough time for the feelings to dampen. When I was in better states I would buy more books to strengthen my safety net. It made when people gave me books even more special, because even though they don’t know, they are helping to keep me around a little bit longer. It makes it so I am productive even in my worst states (though it makes me all the more upset when my cognitive function is t good enough to read) and so that I have to get into a good enough state to read in order to get closer to killing myself which in turn makes me farther from doing so.  it’s the best coping mechanism I’ve used so far.

It doesn't matter if it's a popular classic or if it's an underrated gem that feels like only you've read it, please just share with me the books you consider perfect and maybe a little reason why you think so. Feel free to post one book or multiple books.

For me, the books I consider perfect are Les Miserables, Don Quixote, Watership Down and The Iliad (there's bound to be more but for the time being these are the ones that pop into my head).

Les Miserables - it's tragic but also immensely life-affirming. You can't help but love Jean Valjean: for every wrong he does, he attempts to right it and throughout his life he sticks by that ethic even when it's the most difficult thing to do. There's so many characters that intertwine and interact with each other that it's hard not to fall for some of the relationships in this book too, especially Marius and Eponine. They're both clearly underdogs that were meant to be together but life just has its ways of complicating things.

Don Quixote - it's incredibly funny, with plenty of little jokes directly from Cervantes that criticises the author of an unauthorised sequel of Don Quixote that was published before Cervantes could finish the second volume of his novel. Don Quixote is both a fool and a genius. It's hard not to admire his constant determination to succeed even if his attempts are doomed to fail (the obvious example is the windmill charge but that's such a small segment of the large book: I loved the part where he confuses two flocks of sheep as two warring factions and decides to try and help both).

Watership Down - a beautiful look at environmental concerns, dictatorships, folklore and religion through the adventure of a group of rabbits in search of a new home. The adventure is full of intricacies such as stories of the great rabbit El-Ahrairah, the black rabbit of Inle, the social and gender roles of the rabbits, communication amongst different species, etc. Also that ending is going to stick with you. Very excited about the BBC series coming this December.

The Iliad - a little slow to start (but understandable as the ship catalog and soldier registry is almost like Homer's way of name-dropping the names of people in the audiences he used to orate to as well as their family members that were in the military) but once this beast of an epic poem gets going, it doesn't slow down. The violence is unflinching (two ways of tasting copper!) and it's full of Greek Gods throwing shade; soldiers' trash talking; interior politics and manipulation from both the soldiers and Gods; and an incredible tragedy (I won't spoil how the book ends for those unfamiliar with Greek mythology and The Iliad but even if you are aware of what happens, reading how it develops to that point in The Iliad is haunting and it still lingers with me a year after having read it).

TL;DR: which books do you consider perfect 10/10s? Not just the books you really like, but the books that don't seem to do any wrong at all!"

a7mocj,books,What's your favorite opening line to a book?,"Mine is probably the opening line to Salem's Lot: “Almost everyone thought the man and the boy were father and son.”

This line tells us so much. It tells us the relative ages of the two main characters, that they are not related, and that they are currently in a place where people don't know them (otherwise, why would everyone be wrong about their relationship?). This information then leads the reader to wonder why these two guys are away from their homes. What could have driven them out? Where is the family of the boy? Why would he travel without them? 

Almost immediately, this one line immerses the reader in a dark mystery that foreshadows a potentially evil ending. Simply amazing."

4mqard,books,Just read books 1-4 of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy for the first time ever. This is unequivocally the best book series I have ever read and I don't know what to do with my life now :(,"This is one of those series that I'd always heard about but somehow never got around to reading. Now that I have I'm wondering where it's been all my life, but also realizing that there's a lot of concepts and intelligent existential wit in it that I might not have caught onto if I had read it when I was younger. I haven't ever read anything that was simultaneously this witty, hilarious, intelligent, and original. In fact I haven't been able to put it down since I started the first book a week or two ago. It's honestly a bit difficult to put into words how brilliant this series is, in so many different ways - suffice it to say that if there was any piece of literature that captured my perspective and spirit, this is it.

I just finished the fourth book, which took all of Adam's charm and applied it to one of the most poignantly touching love stories I've ever read, and now I don't know what to do with my life. I feel like I've experienced everything I wanted life to offer me through the eyes of Arthur Dent, and now that I'm back in my own skin in my own vastly different and significantly more boring life I'm feeling a sense of loss. This is coming as a bit of a surprise since I wasn't expecting to find this kind of substance from these books. I had always imagined that they were just some silly, slap-stick humor type sci-fi books.

Besides ranting about the meaning these books have to me and my own sadness that the man who created them is no longer with us, I also wanted to create this post to ask you guys two things:

1) Should I read Mostly Harmless? The general consensus I've gotten is that it takes the beauty of the fourth book and takes it in a depressing direction, and I'd really much rather end this journey on the note it's on right now (as has been recommended to me more than a few times). But at the same time I want so badly to read more HHGttG. So I'm feeling a bit torn. Also, what about the 6th book that eion colfer wrote?

2) Are there any other books out there that come anywhere close to the psychedelic wit, hilarity, and spirit that this series has? I've heard dirk gently recommended more than a few times, and I'm about 1 or 2 chapters into it right now but it hasn't captivated me in the same way that HHGttG did. I'm going to continue on with it anyway though since Adams was behind it.

So long, Douglas Adams... and thanks for all the fish. :'(

Edit: Wow, wasn't expecting this to explode like this. I think it's gunna take me the next few years to get through my inbox lol. 

I've got enough recommendations in this thread to keep me reading for a couple lifetimes lol - but Pratchett, Gaiman, and Vonnegut are definitely the most common ones, so I'll definitely be digging into that content. And there's about as many people vehemently stating that I shouldn't read mostly harmless as there are saying that I should. Still a bit unsure about it but I'm thinking I'll give it a bit of time to let the beauty of the first four books fade into my memory and then come back and check it out. 

Thanks for the reviews and recommendations everybody! "

I hope to bring these texts to a readable, modern English while also attempting to explain certain cultural aspects that may appear.

I am beginning my project with children’s literature. I have already posted a translation of the story *Dubravka* (1957) by Radiy Pogodin, and am currently working on the translation of Arkady Gaidar’s 1938 novella *The Fate of a Drummer Boy*.

I can’t help but add the very first book that started the frenzy off. The story of a young girl who defected from North Korea was so riveting, I finished it in three days. She had a TED talk as well for those who are interested. 


**The Book Thief** by Markus Zusak

The WW2 era always fascinated me, and the story of a young girl in Nazi Germany shows a side to the war us Americans rarely see. Tragedy, love, and a passion for reading kept me entangled for too many late nights on this one.


**The Long Way To A Small Angry Planet** by Becky Chambers

I really should include all three of her “Wayfarer” series in this, as well as her latest fourth book. This was a Reddit Book Club section that I enjoyed SO much, I immediately bought the remaining two: “A Closed and Common Orbit” and “Record of a Spaceborn Few”. Chambers has a way of writing such believable science fiction without sounding dull or over the top. I wish she had more novels out.


**A Thousand Splendid Suns** and **Kite Runner** by Khaled Hosseini 

Both of Hosseini’s books take place in the tumultuous Middle East during times of peace and then times of conflict. The contrast between both time frames and how it affected the characters pulled some big ugly tears from me a few times. He writes with such depth I found myself ordering “And The Mountains Echoed” to read next.


**Where the Crawdads Sing** by Delia Owens

Don’t judge a book by its cover and don’t assume a “swamp rat” is just that. I was recommended this one and I’ve learned to listen to my friends; they clearly know what I will enjoy. Every recommendation I chose to read I was thoroughly entertained. 


**Born a Crime** by Trevor Noah

If you think Trevor Noah is funny in his stand-up comedy, you will laugh at his childhood memoir about growing up in South Africa. Definitely had me chuckling out loud.


**The Goldfinch** by Donna Tartt

I did not expect this to be such a long book. When it showed up at my door I wondered what I got myself into. The first few chapters I still thought I was crazy. But I have a rule: get halfway through at least before you give up. I maybe got a half dozen chapters in before I knew I’d never give it up. I’ve been told the movie was less than entertaining however so I probably will skip it. 


**The Huntress** by Kate Quinn

Another one recommended by a friend and sure enough I stayed awake far too late some nights because I couldn’t put this down. Told from the point of view of each of the main characters, the intertwining as it progresses is a style I’ve found I enjoy very much. I’m told Quinn’s other book “The Alice Network” is also one I need to read.


**Entire Harry Potter Series** by JK Rowling

I spent well over a decade refusing to read Harry Potter or watch any of the movies. I resisted purely because it was so trendy. I’m not a “rebel” or anything, I just didn’t want to get caught up in SUCH a strong craze. Well now I know WHY it was so immensely popular. Oh and yes, now I have seen the movies as well :)


EDIT: thank you so much for the support and for the shiny metal! This sub has been so informative and I’m so grateful for all the books it has led me to read. You all rock!

EDIT 2: lots of people have asked

1) How could I go so long without reading?! After high school life just got in the way and my time management was poor back then. I wish I had books as a refuge for some dark times though, and I hope anyone trying to get back into reading is successful.

2) How do I stay so focused or read so quickly? I used to wander off in thought a lot and it got worse and my list of worries grew as an adult. Now, I sit with the audio version as well as the physical book and it keeps me focused. 

3) Do I buy brand new books, used, library etc? I love the feel of real books. But this can be more expensive than an electronic reader for sure. Thrift stores, garage sales, used book sales, and Amazon have been my saving grace. I found my entire hard cover Harry Potter set at a thrift store in fact. Took a few trips to get it all but at $3 a book it was worth it.

PLEASE keep the recommendations coming!! Of all the books I chose to read this year maybe five were of my own choosing. Most were from Reddit, friends, family, and various articles online. You people have opened my eyes to some incredible books!"

If there was ever a book that held me so captivated for so long before, I certainly don’t remember. Rothfuss certainly has a way with words especially when establishing atmosphere and ambiance. His world is rife with character and depth and is as lively as our own, as well as adorably tongue-in-cheek at times. Each character I feel like I know on a personal level. I had legitimate difficulty putting this book down and that has not happened in at least ten years. 

One of my favorite things about this series is that there’s a sort of science to the magic the characters create, which called sympathy. This lets you more or less deduce how things take effect and sort of tally what’s happening magically, something I don’t think a lot of fantasy books have, in my experience. Rothfuss meshes magic with actual established science and reason making it just that much more believable.

Truth be told I’m nearly halfway through Wise Man’s Fear, the second book, and it’s just as great for further establishing the world at large. I anxiously await the third book, however I’m not really in any rush. Rothfuss should take all the time he needs to make everything just right. thankfully I have the rest of book two to tide me over until then. There’s an accompanying book to go with them that I will undoubtedly read as well because I can’t get enough! I cannot speak enough praise of the Name of the Wind.

EDIT: Hi, Front Page! Holy shit this exploded! i'll get to comments as i am able, but i'm not sure. i might have to fake my own death or something. maybe open an inn in some backwater town...

EDIT 2: can we get an 'upvote all responses' button? plz and thanx.

EDIT 3: Kingkiller seems to be a love/hate series, which is all well and good, but y’all need to stop judging people by what they read, ffs.

EDIT 4: just wanted to say that i am thrilled this post received so much traction and i'm elated that the grand majority love this series as much as i do. now, collectively, we play the waiting game. thanks so much for bringing me to the front page!!

EDIT 5 & 6: with regard to Rothfuss “taking so long” to write the third book, I learned after posting this that the dudes parents died while writing these books. So, lay the fuck off him and  let the man write in peace! This is why I say that he can take all the time he needs. How fucking hard is it to wait for something anyhow?! You’re doing literally nothing!

Holy shit!! Gold and PLATINUM!! thanks so much!!"

ahfcxf,books,When I replaced social media with reading,"A couple years ago I discovered my library has an ebook app I can download onto my phone.  So, as an experiment, I moved my Facebook app and put the ebook app in its place.  I normally used the Facebook app when doing things like waiting in the lunch line or at the bus stop or something.  I told myself that from there on out, I would read during those times instead of browsing social media.  The results were more telling than I expected.  Here's what I noticed:

1. I had been checking social media so often that it had become a muscle memory.  For the first few days, I would constantly reach into my pocket, pull out my phone, and open the app, all without realizing.  And then I would be startled to see a sea of words instead of Facebook.  Because I guess reading is something that calls for actual attention, which I wasn't prepared to give during those times.  But I had no idea how habitually I was checking Facebook until I was doing this.
2. I went to a presentation about criminal justice reform.  When it was getting wrapped up and conclusions were being said, I got bored, and was about to reach for my phone.  But then I thought: if I had a clunky book with me, would I pull it out and start reading it right then?  No, because that would be rude.  Cell phones seem like they're less rude because I COULD be doing something important, like answering an urgent text.  But is being rude OK as long as you're disguising it well?  Hmmm.... 
3. I found myself reading a lot more.  Finishing a lot more books.  Which is great!  Except, it means that I had previously been reading actual books worth of social media on a regular basis.  I find this disturbing to think about.
4. I came to like ebooks!  They're much easier for reading on-the-go, and since I'm using my library's app I can support the library without having to make the trip down there.

I hope I'm not coming off as some old guy who thinks that phones and social media are evil.  I still use social media regularly, including the apps, but this experiment shed some light on problematic habits I'd formed and how I can use this technology more wisely.  "

5. Descriptions and stories that outline what every position does.

6. Discussion of the importance and how a harpoon is cared for and used.

it7lh8,books,I have started reading to my wife and it is an awesome feeling,"Hi everyone,

Sometime last month I saw a post from this subreddit on the popular screen talking about how they only watched the Lord of the Rings movies and how the books vastly expanded the story. So I thought, why not, I love fantasy books and decided I would start from the beginning of the series when I could. Jump to last week, my wife and I head to B&N and pick up a few books. I headed straight to the sci-fi and fantasy section as usual and found the LOTR section. I picked up a copy of the Silmarillion among a few other books and headed out (obviously stopping by the board game selection before leaving).

Jump to 3 nights ago, I was sitting in bed reading and my wife was saying she was having a really tough time going to sleep and I said I could read to her. As a note, my wife doesn't prefer the time dedicated to world building that I enjoy, which is basically all of the Silmarillion for as far as I've gotten. So I started reading to her and about a chapter later she was out like a light.

So for the last couple of nights, our night time procedure has been to get ready for bed then for her to tell me to grab the book and start reading and I've got to say... It is an awesome feeling.  I plan to only read it before bed so I can make this last as long as possible."
kuendn,books,Do you ever start reading a book but don't get hooked so you want to read a different one but can't because you haven't finished the current one so you have to drag yourself to finish it because you just can't bear to DNF a book?,"I started the year on a fantasy-romance high with 'The Shadows Between Us' and after looking for suggestions from r/suggestmeabook I followed it up with Uprooted. Turns out the romance is basically a side plot and I've been dragging myself to read through it so I can get to the romance part (if there even is). This doesn't mean the book's boring or the story's bad - it's actually pretty good and I'll probably enjoy it more if I wasn't in the mood for something more romance-centered.

Ever read a book which made you feel like this?

EDIT: Read a lot of comments giving advice and I'd just like to say thanks for making me lose guilt over not finishing a book (and y'all did that in just an hour!). I see some people have had to figure this out on their own. I'm lucky to have been assured immediately on my first time experiencing this!

UPDATE: I DNF-ED IT WOOO AND ALL MY GUILT AND HESITATIONS ARE GONE THANKS TO Y'ALL WOOHOO All of us who struggle with the same problem would like to thank y'all so much!

EDIT: Jwu and this blew up! Thanks for the awards! I'll try to read through all the comments sometime and hopefully this post and the comments helped a lot of people!"

gfsd3y,books,I fulfilled my ambition of reading IT.,"Due to my autism I have never been able to read novels and was told I never would, it just never worked for me. All I see is a jumble of words that don't seem to go anywhere in my mind. I also have no internal reading voice (well I do but it's just flat and monotone and has no emotional connection to words at all missing all the range and cadence needed to read) and on top of that my mind doesn't form any images unless I have already seen what Im trying to imagine. As you can see these factors make it almost impossible to read fiction novels. 

Well it took me a lot of hard work and a lot of time and concentration but I did it! I finally fulfilled my ambition of reading Stephen King's IT.

This ambition all started in the 90s when the IT miniseries first came out, I instantly fell in love with the whole thing from the characters to the place of Derry, Maine. I watched it so much that I knew it inside out, but I always knew by word of mouth that the book was a million times better.

Ive tried on and off to read this book but have always failed at pretty much page 1. Well after the new movies came out I was adamant I was gonna read this thing even if it killed me. 

I thought about my problems for a long time and finally came up with solutions to get past them... Basically I used the audiobook read by Steven Weber to replace my inner voice, I invested in the first edition to read along with (thoughts being that if I invested money it would be further incentive) and I sat in a dark room to block out all stimulus other than the words (using a reading lamp aimed only at the book). 

So I started the audio book and read along with the voice and it worked, it started going in! His voice sort of became my own and because I'd seen the miniseries and movies I didn't have any issues knowing what things and people looked like.

Well it took me since December but I finally reached the end and **OMG** what an amazing journey. Its probably been one of the greatest feelings and experiences in my life! I really can't get across enough how much I loved it. I struggle very much with emotions but this experience made me feel what I assume people refer to as emotion. The book is so so **SO** much better than any movie. I loved it so much that I am in the process of reading it again 😊

I just wanted to share this hoping it might inspire someone else to not give up on reading, it can enrich your life so much if you invest the time and effort. I also just wanted to share because I'm just so proud of myself.

Sorry this has been so long (and probably hard to make sense of, not great at writing either), but thank you for taking the time to read it.


IT Fan.

**For anyone wondering, my next book will be The Stand and my ultimate goal is to reach The Dark Tower. I will keep everyone updated with my progress in further posts.**

**TWITTER EDIT** I contacted Stephen King on twitter as some of you told me to, I don't think he will reply but I tried. My twitter is @Autistic_IT_Fan if anyone wants to know. 

**edit** I didn't expect this much response, I'm blown away. Thank you everyone and I am trying my best to reply to you all. Sorry if I miss anyone but its very difficult to keep up. 😊

**edit 2** Wow, thank you for the awards everyone 😁 I never thought in a million years I would get this response, it's given me so much drive to continue my reading journey.

**edit 3** Thank you so much everyone, I have never felt this much support or praise in my whole life. Its overwhelming. Thank you all for being so kind.

2. The only things my friend told me about Flowers for Algernon was that it was a moving but incredibly sad book. I had no idea what the plot or basis of the book was, she didn’t want to spoil anything. 

So, when I was on my library’s website and Flowers in the Attic was on the available now list, I thought, “oh, yes, the flowers book. This must be it.”


I’m sure everyone has their opinions about Flowers in the Attic, but uh ... it was not the poignant, thought-provoking read I was expecting."

8q9z0x,books,Just read Harry Potter for the first time. It helps that I’ve forgotten most of the plot of the movies.,"I’m 22 and I can’t believe it took me this long - Sorcerer’s Stone was such a blast, I can’t wait to buy Chamber of Secrets tomorrow. I’m familiar with the characters but to be honest I barely remember anything from the films - save for a few of the major plot points.

But even then there’s big stuff I don’t remember like what was in the chamber of secrets, who the prisoner of Azcaban was, what the other horecruxes were, and what the triangle circle line logo thing was. I do remember quite a bit of Goblet of Fire though for some reason.

I think forgetting the movies kinda enhanced my reading experience because when I’ve tried reading other books of movies I’ve watched I have a hard time picturing things different from how I remember it.

Really excited to keep on reading ☺️

Edit: Just wanted to say I’m not trying to bag on the movies - just that forgetting the movies is helping me imagine things more freshly. The book made very vivid images in my head and that’s a testament to JK’s writing."

""You need to pick out the best book you've never read.""

So we went in and after some very careful deliberation I picked out *When the Killing's Done* by T. C. Boyle and he ended up with *The Party: The Secret World of China's Communist Rulers* by Richard McGregor. Once we revealed our selections he looked me in the eye and said ""Now switch!""

So now I have to read about China's Communist leaders and he has to read T. C. Boyle. I wanted to share this because I thought it was a clever idea for a first date between book lovers and an unusual way of getting to know someone based on their taste in books. 

Has anyone else done something like this? If so, how did it turn out?

I didn't like Potter movies at first because I always watched them after reading the books. Its been a while I read those books and now I really like those movies. You get my point?

I didn't even like the lotr movies at first and now I love them. 
Right now I'm on a Michael chrichton binge and watched Congo and sphere after reading the books and I hated every minute of it. I also thought Jurassic Park paled in comparison to the books and that's one of my favorite movies of all time.

I think it's something to do with human psychology. Even the slightest difference from books to movies makes me mad. Even if that change is for the better.
At least give it a few months before u watch the movie after finishing the book. 

End of rant.

Edit: I agree that there are plenty of movies as good as or better than the books, but my point is that it's not a good idea to watch them soon after reading the book. I think Jurassic Park and fight club are better than the books but when you see them after just finishing the books it always dissappointed me. Not because of the bad quality of the movie but because it wasn't the exact thing I imagined while reading the book. "

Now I’m trying to read Inferno - holy crap, it’s so poorly written. Maybe I’m just realizing now something that’s always been there, but Dan Brown’s writing style is so clunky that it’s ruining the book for me. The fact that he interjects with another art history fact twice a page just pulls me out of the story so much that it’s actually disengaging. And his cringeworthy over-use of adjectives just gets silly at times. While I try not to be a pretentious reader and just enjoy a book for what it is, I can’t deny that I just want to call it quits and never read a Brown book again.

This week's atrocity comes to us from Dean Koontz's bestselling 1980 thriller: *WHISPERS*. If you liked watching ""The Room,"" you'll love reading Dean Koontz's *WHISPERS*. It's kind of like James Patterson's *KISS THE GIRLS*, except the plot is completely different, and it is even more stupid.

SETUP:
 
Our protagonists are flying on a Cessna airplane in 1980.

THE SENTENCE:

For a minute, the three of them sat in silence, within the expensive, single-engine, overhead-wing, two-hundred-mile-per-hour, sixteen-mile-per-gallon, white and red and mustard-yellow, airborne cocoon.

CONCLUSION:

If you are Dan Brown, you are probably taking notes so you can imitate that fabulous sentence structure. It was very descriptive. You probably like the way Dean Koontz fit the word ""expensive"" in there, just in case his readers thought Cessna airplanes were cheap. 

I liked the way Koontz tried to set the world record for commas per character in a published sentence. I mean, I can totally picture that Cessna in my head. Can't you? I also like the way Koontz's name makes me think about vaginas.

Speaking of vaginas, the sex scenes in this novel would make Danielle Steele fingerbang herself in a heartbeat. Just sayin'.

Thanks for reading the inaugural episode of **The Worst Sentence**. Tune in sometime in the next six months, and I might get around to doing another one. 

Until then, 

Happy reading!

I'm actually really glad my english teachers assigned me books to read. Without them I never would have tried branching out and stretching my reading interests. Books I love now such as The Once and Future King, The Book Thief, Flowers for Algernon, and Dracula all were assigned to me in high school.

klnepp,books,"I'm a newbie to epic Sci-Fi literature, and reading DUNE has been an exhausting experience.","Ok. I know that this post is going to be downvoted to hell, although I never understood why people downvote a post that has a different opinion to theirs, but I will say it anyways.. Reading DUNE did not turn out the way I thought it would.
 
I liked science fiction ideas in general ever since I was a kid. It was mostly due to the influence of films and thriller novels with light sci-fi plot lines with the exception of Andy Weir's *The Martian* which I loved. But I wanted to pick up some classic sci-fi works for quite some time.

So, this year, I decided to give DUNE a go as I wanted to read this novel before watching the movie that was supposed to come out this December. I started the novel in August. 

It was going fine until the first couple of hundred pages, but soon the reading experience turned into a tough one. The world building was too complex, and the descriptions seemed to be too much.. of things, traditions, cultures, and whatnot. Additionally, I was having trouble creating the mental images of a lot of things.. example: all the equipment and machinery used on Arrakis.

I don't know if this is how all epic sci-fi is written or if this is specific to particular works but the plot felt to be moving either far too slowly or moving in far too uninteresting way. I think the latter. It was never really exciting to me the journey of Paul and Jessica across the desert and how they get adopted into the Fremen clan.. and the Fremen rituals of Holy Mother and etc...

Unfortunately, none of the things in the book made it a page-turner to me. I gave long break between readings. It took me months to finish this book. But I have to mention that I was reading the new paperback edition. I regretted not going for a kindle edition. That could also be a reason why I read it far too slowly.

I also couldn't connect emotionally to any characters in the book which is strange as there are SO MANY characters. The villain seemed too typical and there are specific plot points that made no sense to me.

Overall, I was quite disappointed that I couldn't enjoy it more. I came to DUNE with different expectations and minimal reading experience in hardcore science fiction literature which I believe to also be contributing to how I'm feeling about this novel. I was left fully exhausted by the end and didn't pickup another novel for this month.

ig9e06,books,I just finished 11/22/63 by Stephen King. The first book I've read from start to finish about 15 years.,"I was never much of a reader, the last book being something like goosebumps - probably one of those 'choose you're own adventure' ones aswell. Everytime I picked up a book I found myself having to read the same page about 3 to 4 times as I just kept getting distracted. Throughout school, I skimmed through the chapters of the compulsory reading books and half-arsed the essays that had to be written about them. 

Until I woke up last week with a craving to read something that wasn't displayed on a digital screen. 11/22/63 was recommended to me and from turning to the first page I was unable to put it down. I finished the book today and can easily say that this novel took me on an adventure that I never thought possible. It was such an immersive experience and I am emotionally exhausted, in a good way. It bought joy, laughter, fear, tears. It was frustrating and satisfying at the same time. I was almost tempted to start it again straight away after finishing, but instead I've picked up a copy of Pet Semetary which I'm about to dive in to.

Anyway, I've found a new hobby and just wanted to chime in and say hello!
Hello."
eixln2,books,PSA: Read books you want to read; not books you think you should read,"I was going to comment this in the other PSA for NY resolutions but, alas, I arrived late, and I doubt it would have been noticed by anyone. 

Anyway. 

I just wanted to tell you all that it's fine to read whatever you want to read. You don't have to read the classics just because they're there. If you want to read something else - something that interests you more, then go for it! 

I used to say 'I want to read X number of books this year/month' etc and usually I'd end up picking almost entirely from the classics. But I've got news for you - just because they're universally acknowledged as 'classics' doesn't mean they have universal appeal. Frequently, I'd end up abandoning the goal. 

You might find them slow or dull or you don't connect with the characters because you're a 30-year-old man who works as an engineer in Manchester and you struggle to relate to the woes of 19th-century socialites, soldiers and vagabonds. ^(That's not a description of me btw)

I used to find it difficult to read if I was reading something I didn't wholeheartedly enjoy. These days I pick a few books I believe I'll like and then follow it up with a classic I'm unsure of. 

But ultimately my message is that you shouldn't feel pressured to read certain things - read because you enjoy it not because it's something to check off. 

For me - this means my next 5 list looks like this: 

*Ayoade on Top* - Richard Ayoade

*Lanny* - Max Porter

*The Wall* - John Lanchester

*I, Claudius* - Robert Graves

*The Master and Margarita* - Mikhail Bulgakov 

(Yes, I know I'm late to reading those two from the BP longlist. I am always fashionably late.)"

Douglas Adams is also a very, very clever wordsmith. He tickled and tortured the English language into some very strange similes and metaphors that were bracingly descriptive. Helped me escape from my day to day worries, accomplishing what I usually hope a book accomplishes for me.

eah30f,books,The Iliad: I'm enjoying it so far but I can't help cracking up at the way these dudes will just pause in the chaos of battle to shit-talk their opponent for an entire page,"This happens a lot throughout the story, but I found this one in particular hilarious. Note, this is all happening in the thick of an intense battle with men fighting all around:

>Paris drew back his arm from the bow  
and shot. Not in vain did the arrow fly from his hand,  
but hit Diomedes' right foot, on the flat part: the shaft went through,  
stuck fast in the ground. Then, with loud laughter, Paris  
sprang out from his hiding place and shouted boastfully:  
""You're hit! Not in vain did my shaft fly! Oh, how I wish  
I'd caught your nether belly, and taken your life away!  
Then would the Trojans have had some relief from their troubles,  
who now tremble before you like bleating sheep with a lion.""

>To him, quite unafraid, strong Diomedes replied:  
""Bowman, foul-mouthed cursor, pretty-locks, ogler of virgins! --  
If you'd only make trial of me face to face, wearing armor,  
then your bow and your showers of arrows would not protect you;  
and even now your boast is just to have scratched my foot!  
I don't care -- it could well have been a daft child or a woman  
that shot me, so blunt the shafts of a weakling, a nobody!  
Very different indeed, if it only grazes its target,  
is the sharp spear sped by *my* hand: it brings a man instant death,  
and the cheeks of his widow are torn in death and mourning,  
and his children are orphaned, while he reddens the earth  
with his blood, and rots, more vultures than women round him.""

I think it's the fact that Paris basically pinned Diomedes in place with an arrow through the foot, creating the perfect opportunity to take him out while he's hindered, but instead opts to stand out of arms reach and boast about hitting him, that makes this passage so funny to me. I guess that's a part of Paris' character: He's got a loud mouth but not enough courage to take on Diomedes, even in this weakened state.

I would love to see a parody of The Iliad that captures this; all the soldiers around them pausing the fight to let them duke it out verbally, ooooooo-ing at some of the biggest burns."

* How do you get away with murder when some cops can read minds?
* Worth a read? **Yes**
* Primary Driver (Plot, World, or **Character**)
* Bechdel Test? Fail
* Science Gibberish? Minimal
* Very enjoyable - good, concise world-building.  And an excellent job making a protagonist who is a bad guy... but you still want him to win.  Romantic plotline is unnecessary and feels very groomingy.  Sharp writing.

1954 - They'd Rather Be Right by  Mark Clifton & Frank Riley

* What if computers could fix anything, even people?
* Worth a read? No
* Primary Driver (Plot, **World**, or Character)
* Bechdel Test? Fail
* Science Gibberish? Heaps
* This book is straight up not good.  An almost endless stream of garbage science mixed with some casual sexism.  Don't read it.  It's not bad in any way that makes it remarkable, it's just not good.

1956 - Double Star by Robert A. Heinlein

* An actor puts on his best performance by impersonating a politician.
* Worth a read? **Yes**
* Primary Driver (Plot, World, or **Character**)
* Bechdel Test? Fail
* Science Gibberish? Minimal
* A surprisingly funny and engaging book.  Excellent narrator; charming and charismatic.  Stands the test of time very well.

1958 - The Big Time by Fritz Lieber

* Even soldiers in the time war need safe havens
* Worth a read? No
* Primary Driver (Plot, **World**, or Character)
* Bechdel Test? Pass
* Science Gibberish? Plenty
* A rather bland story involving time travel.  Uninteresting characters and dull plot are used to flesh out a none-too-thrilling world.  Saving grace is that it's super short.

1958 - A Case of Conscience by James Blish

* What if alien society seems too perfect?
* Worth a read? No, but a soft no.
* Primary Driver (Plot, **World**, or Character)
* Bechdel Test? Fail
* Science Gibberish? Plenty
* Not bad, but not that great.  It's mostly world building, which is half baked.  Also the religion stuff doesn't really do it for me - possibly because the characters are each one character trait, so there's no believable depth to zealotry.

1959 - Starship Troopers by Robert A. Heinlein

* Welcome to the Mobile Infantry, the military of the future!
* Worth a read? **Yes**
* Primary Driver (Plot, World, or **Character**)
* Bechdel Test? Fail
* Science Gibberish? Minimal
* Status as classic well earned.  Both a fun space military romp and a condemnation of the military.  No worrisome grey morality.  Compelling protagonist and excellent details keep book moving at remarkable speed.

Edit: Many people have noted that Starship Troopers is purely pro military.  I stand corrected; having seen the movie before reading the book, I read the condemnation into the original text.  There are parts that are anti-bureaucracy (in the military) but those are different.  This does not alter my enjoyment of the book, just figured it was worth noting.

1959 - A Canticle for Leibowitz

* The Order of Leibowitz does its best to make sure that next time will be different.
* Worth a read? **Yes**
* Primary Driver (Plot, **World**, or Character)
* Bechdel Test? Fail
* Science Gibberish? Minimal
* I love the first section of this book, greatly enjoy the second, and found the third decent.  That said, if it was only the first third, the point of the book would still be clear.  Characters are very well written and distinct.

I'll continue to post each decade of books when they're done, and do a final master list when through everything, but it's around 200 books, so it'll be a hot minute.  I'm also only doing the Novel category for now, though I may do one of the others as well in the future.

If there are other subjects or comments that would be useful to see in future posts, please tell me!  I'm trying to keep it concise but informative.

Any questions or comments? Fire away!

Edit!

The Bechdel Test is a simple question: do two named female characters converse about something other than a man.  Whether or not a book passes is not a condemnation so much as an observation; it was the best binary determination I could find.  Seems like a good way to see how writing has evolved over the years.

Further Edit!

Many people have noted that science fiction frequently has characters who defy gender - aliens, androids, and so on - looking at you, Left Hand of Darkness!  I'd welcome suggestions for a supplement to the Bechdel Test that helps explore this further.  I'd also appreciate suggestions of anything comparable for other groups or themes (presence of different minority groups, patriarchy, militarism, religion, and so on), as some folks have suggested.  I'll see what I can do, but simplicity is part of the goal here, of course.

Edit on Gibberish!

This is what I mean:

""There must be intercommunication between all the Bossies. It was not difficult to found the principles on which this would operate. Bossy functioned already by a harmonic vibration needed to be broadcast on the same principle as the radio wave. No new principle was needed. Any cookbook engineer could do it—even those who believe what they read in the textbooks and consider pure assumption to be proved fact. It was not difficult to design the sending and receiving apparatus, nor was extra time consumed since this small alteration was being made contiguous with the production set up time of the rest. The production of countless copies of the brain floss itself was likewise no real problem, no more difficult than using a key-punched master card to duplicate others by the thousands or millions on the old-fashioned hole punch computer system."" - They'd Rather Be Right

9a8upk,books,I finished Stephen King’s 11/22/63 last night. I’m still shaken up.,"This book is unbelievable. I think I took 4 or 5 days to finish it, but I think this book is best savored rather than binged.

I loved every single page of this ridiculously well-written story. Characters floored me. Dialogue floored me. The *story* floored me. I don’t give a singular shit if the historical accuracy isn’t there; I’m an American and I read this strictly as fiction. In my eyes, the people who write off this book because they disagree with King’s interpretation of the assassination are fools.

And dear God, that ending. Yeah, I’m a guy who sheds tears a lot—I mean a *lot*—while reading or watching. Just recently, I probably cried during like 3 or 4 movies. And during this book, my cheeks were soaked during the performance of *Of Mice and Men.* It was such a heartwarming and simultaneously heartbreaking moment. Maybe I’m wrong, but I also saw it as a little foreshadowing for this ending. Now, for the ending itself. I didn’t cry at all. I have no idea why. The opposite of George, I was dry-eyed in those final pages but not so during the rest of the book. It was so weird, I can’t explain it, especially considering that the ending was incredibly heartbreaking and should bring anyone who resonated with this story to tears.

This is the best book I’ve ever read. Now that I’m finished with it—it’s the morning after—I have no idea where to go next. I know I’m going to read another one of King’s books, but just the thought that there won’t be another chance for Sadie and George will haunt me for a while, I think.

Then book 2 came out. It's bad. Like...*really* bad. Almost unrecognizable. I'm super bummed out. And there is going to be a third book. And strange as it sounds, I'm 100% confident book 3 will be better than book 2.

Why? Because I've seen this SO MANY times. Great book 1, but the writer is obsessed with making it a trilogy, because that's what so many other writers are doing. So you get a book 2 were very little of note actually happens. The writer needs to fill up space so it can become a proper trilogy. And it's nothing like book 1 which you loved so much. But then book 3 is all fire and lighting, because everything gets squeezed into it for a climactic ending.

There is no shame in having a series be 2 books. And if you have a story that has so much to tell it needs to be 3 or more books, by all means. Just don't make it a trilogy for the sake of it being a trilogy, because readers will notice very fast that it actually shouldn't be 3 books content-wise."

* Yes, Twilight is there.  I have read them and enjoyed them.  I did it before the movies and I have no regrets.  I have read and enjoyed many books that fall all over the continuum of quality.  I'm not a fan of bagging on books even if I didn't like them. You can keep yelling at me about it but is it really worth your time?
* I estimate, roughly, that there are 1,200 books.  I have read somewhere between 70-80% of the whole library.  It's closer to 90% if you just count SciFi/Fantasy books.

kwc9ij,books,Books set in the covid-reality are going to start appearing and I don't want to read them.,"I've just realised that I won't be able to read most of the new books - because I'm not ready to read about people wearing maska, people isolating etc. Not yet, at least. Maybe one day in the future. But I hate this reality and I don't cope with it well. I just hate the thought of reading about it, it's just too fresh.

Of course I have a lot to read. Books published before 2021 or new books set in the past, fantasy/SF etc., that's more than enough. But I would love to just be able to pick up a new thriller or mainstream novel without plunging into the same shit I have to live in.

Of course I didn’t recently discover them, but I hadn’t actually been to one since I was a kid until just recently, because I have a 1 1/2 year old kid who just wants to be read to all day. Me and her mom can’t afford to buy her new books often, so I googled library branches near me, just so we could get her new books to cycle through on a regular basis, but I did not remember what a tremendous resource libraries could be. They are cool AF. And librarians know everything. 

Also, taking my baby to the library twice a week got me and my wife back into reading. We’ve always liked reading, but we would always buy new books whenever we wanted to read something. Now we’re both reading multiple books a week. 

Anyways, that’s it. I just needed a soap box so I could tell everybody they should visit their libraries. And donate to their libraries. And fuck anybody, especially any politician, who tries to convince you libraries aren’t essential. Libraries are an epicenter for knowledge and culture. Visit and support your local libraries in any way you can.

bo55fr,books,To parents who are really restrictive of what their kids read: why?,"I work in a library and it's a regular occurrence to hear kids upset that their parents won't let them take out a certain book. They always give the same few excuses:  

""This looks too difficult for you."" So what? Kids need to be challenging themselves. It's never the case that these kids wandered into the adult section and picked up a Henry James book or a 50 Shades knockoff. It's usually a popular children's chapter book they pick up. If they're interested in the story in the first place, they would power through the difficulties and just maybe become better readers. Or you can spend some time reading the book with them and helping them become better readers.

""You've read this before."" Is it so bad to read the same book multiple times? Even adults who claim to love reading think it's silly to reread books. Getting to know the story better means you'll understand it better and get a deeper insight into it. Obviously if they want to read a book multiple times it means they have a deeper connection with it. Why take away that pleasure?

""We have enough books already."" Our limit's like, 50 books. Are you worried you won't be able to keep track of them all and accidentally return them late? Then do what some of my coworkers do and come up with a system. Teach your kids some responsibility. Are you worried they won't finish it all before they're due? Well, I guess they'll learn the hard way not to splurge and get too much at the same time. 

""This just doesn't look good."" Now this I genuinely don't understand. Why force your own unfounded opinions on your child? Why would you teach them to be judgemental and literally judge books by their covers? Why would you limit the wonderful world of books and reading?

""AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!"" AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!"

My collection was just over 1100 books, and I truly loved every single one of them. I went through every identifiable item in the house with the inventory specialist our insurance company sent, because I don't really have an emotional attachment to any of the ""things,"" whereas my wife sobbed at even the thought of seeing it. Fast forward to Christmas. Behind the boxes of Legos for our son, and the princess gear for our daughter, were stack after stack of books, lovingly picked by my beautiful wife. Stephen Ambrose, Aldous Huxley, Ken Follett, William Golding... 35 books in all. Hard to explain to her why I couldn't muster a single tear in the hospital when our daughter was born, yet couldn't stop the biblical torrent streaming down my 38yo cheeks because of a few King novels. 

Update: Thank you all so much for the responses! I didn't expect this much outpouring of support and well-wishes, and don't really know how to process it. It feels wrong to, for lack of a better way of putting it, mourn the loss of ""things."" We were out when the fire happened, so no one was hurt (our two cats were home but came out of it unscathed), and grieving over possessions leaves me with an overwhelming feeling of guilt. I guess that's what led to my post in the first place. Having an emotional response to this beautiful gift has left me feeling more things than I know how to process, and writing about it has, surprisingly, helped. 

Thank you all again.

Not only that, but it was written by William Steig--who you might recognize as 1. A super prolific children's author ([Dr. De Soto](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fa/CoverofDoctordesoto.gif), Sylvester and the Magic Pebble), or 2. The most-ever published author and illustrator in the [New Yorker](https://images.fineartamerica.com/images-medium-large-5/new-yorker-february-15th-1964-william-steig.jpg) (in 73 years he worked for them, he produced 2600 drawings and 117 covers).

In short, the guy who wrote Shrek! in 1990 had some serious literary chops.

Curious, I picked up a copy. It’s great, and not what I was expecting. Here are the best parts:

1. **Shrek has super powers.** He gets bit by a snake. The snake dies. He breathes fire, and can spit a flame 99 yards and vent smoke from his ears. He cooks a pheasant with his eyes. He eats lightening.
2. **The art is UGLY in an endearing and iconic way.** I’ve never been a fan of “ugly art” a la Ren and Stimpy, but there is [something endearing about the way Shrek and his malevolence](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/41/36/39/41363963004818debd4c2269b3464ebd.jpg) are depicted. The art fits the theme.
3. **The Verbs are great.** Toddled, spit, cowed, convulsed, hissed things over, kicked, hatched, cackled, crowed, cried, scythed, mumbled...that’s in the first few pages.
4. **It isn’t Disney-fied.** Shrek does not look for redemption. He is a monster. He is hideous. He hates kind things. He still finds a princess (just as hideous), and gets hitched.

And I think that’s the best part. Steig doesn’t use the ogre to make some point about inner beauty, or redemption, or grace.

In the book’s climax, Shrek has to confront his own horrifying visage in a hall of mirrors. This is the perfect spot for Steig to shoehorn in a lesson--for Shrek to look at what he is, reflect on his journey, and learn the error of his ways. Instead, Steig writes:

>***“He faced himself, full of rabid self-esteem...happier than ever to be exactly what he was.”***

Then he marries the princess.

So Shrek has literary origins! Who knew?"

I couldn't ever understand it reading it all in a week. Every few pages gives me enough to think about. 

I explained to them that cellphones and social media and the like also contain letters and that this constitutes ""reading material"". The owners response was ""I don't want to ban cellphones"" and the General Manager added ""it is against corporate rules"". As in, cellphones are also banned.

Edit: I drunkenly posted this and missed a key part of information. The general consensus is that I was coming back late from lunch and that's why books got banned. 

Before Thursday, you were still expected to work and assist customers and go on deliveries. I bitched about having to do all of that and try to eat. I had Sat down to eat at 210 or so and 320 rolled around and I had only ate about a third of my food since I had to get up constantly. 

Anyways, Friday I'm told they're going to try and give us a ""guaranteed 30min break"" to sit down and eat. Once you're done eating you're supposed to get back to work. Once your meal is done so is your break. Physical books are banned because they don't want me to eat to use the full 30min break time. Most other employees can scarf down their food in 10min or so, it usually takes me about 15min to eat a meal regardless if I read or not.

cguogh,books,I don't like Harry Potter (Unpopular opinion by a landslide),"I think J.K Rowling was always a better storyteller than a writer. I read the Harry Potter series recently and I kept seeing so many plotholes. So, so many plotholes. Why would they guard the philosopher's stone with riddles, not locks? Why didn't Fred and George ever say something about Ron being with a man named Peter throughout book 1 and 2? The final book also wasn't as good of a payoff either. The hallows just came out of nowhere, instead of focusing on the horcruxes like it should've (in my opinion). I still enjoyed reading it when I first read it as a non-enthusiast, but as the years went on I began to not like it as much. I think the way characters interact is really great, until the 5th book where Harry becomes an edgy angst lord. There are just so many things I realize isn't all that great about this series. Please tell me what you think.

Edit: A lot of people are trying to defend the guarding method of the stone, but I'm sorry. You're wrong. First of all, by locks, I mean things that would lock it up. Not literal locks. So don't go on about Alohomora, even though it is explained that Flitwick put on a spell that would make Alohomora useless in the room with the flying keys. Yes, a giant plant monster works, but how about something that isn't taught to 1st years? Why put the key that opens the door in a room with said door? Why even let anyone go through if they could solve a riddle like the one snape made? Just have it so that the fire is guarding it. Don't have the way to go through it lying in front of it.  Why should anyone even be able to get through the wall of fire, whether they are smart or not? Why have the key to unlocking every obstacle in front of you? It doesn't matter it's difficult to do it, why even have it in the first place? The possibility of getting through the obstacle may be slim if the key is difficult, but if the key isn't even there in the first place, the obstacle is impossible to go through. Which was the entire point of the obstacle's existence.

Another Edit: Because this keeps coming up; HPMOR. I read it. Liked it, but not enough to look at it again."

Footnotes explaining nuances may also be a good means to overcome the language barrier.","I get the price would sky-rocket, but I think of all literary genres, poetry is the most reliant on cultural aspects and especially linguistic ones.

Translating poetry must be one of the hardest things to do. I remember this anecdote my literature teacher told us, about this Hispanic-Chinese woman (Marcela de Juan) who translated Ancient Chinese poems into Spanish by using Medieval Spanish vocabulary and I remember it being a hugely different experience. Translated poetry almost acts as a different version to the original poem itself, and there's something beautiful and odd about it. That's why I think we should be ‘forced’ to enjoy both.

Edit: I believed it to be unpopular since I kind of said they ‘must’ be translated (i.e. compulsory for all copies), apparently I was wrong and most people share this opinion. In my country however, most poetry books are solely published in its translated version; I am aware there are quite a few publishing houses doing it like this, even Penguin Classics with texts written in older forms of English, but didn't know it was as ubiquitous as people here point out. I'd just like it to be the general rule."
6zmr28,books,Reasons that reading replaced video games as a hobby for me," My whole life I have been an avid video gamer and book lover but as the demands of adulthood stacked up with parenting, work responsibilities, and other things I have found less time to devote towards personal hobbies. For years I gave up reading. But of course in my busy life it was hard to find time to game. I frequently stayed up till 2 or 3am to play. In the end I realized my current stage of life just does not allow me the luxury to sit down and game for uninterrupted hours at a time. A year-and-a-half ago I picked up a novel for the first time in a very long time. I fell in love with reading again, and have found the portability and flexibility of reading fits my lifestyle so well. You can easily read snatches of a book at a time without needing to devote large tracts of time to it. Plus audio books have been great to fill in commute time and make yard/house work more fun. Lastly, novels provide more satisfying and rich narrative than a lot of games do. One day maybe I'll game again, but I'm glad to rediscover reading.  
  
Tldr: Books are portable and can be accessed anywhere, unlike my console/gaming pc  
  
Edit: A lot of people have asked what book got me back into reading. It was **Something Wicked This Way Comes** by Bradbury. 
 
Also, wasn't trying to knock gaming as a hobby. If that's what you enjoy go for it. "

c4sd6f,books,"Newer dystopians are more story focused, as opposed to older dystopians written for the sake of expressing social commentary in the form of allegory","This is a long thought I’ve had bouncing around my brain juices for a while now

Basically in my reading experiences, it seems older, “classic” dystopians were written for the purpose of making complex ideas more palatable to the public by writing them in the form of easy-to-eat allegorical novels.

Meanwhile, newer dystopian books, while still often social commentary, are written more with “story” and “character” than “allegory” in mind.

Example one- *Animal Farm.* Here is a well thought out, famous short novel that uses farm animals as allegory for the slow introduction of communism into Russia. Now, using farm animals is a genius way of framing a governmental revolution, but the characters are, for lack of a better term, not characters.

What I mean by that is they aren’t written for the reader to care about them. They’re written for the purpose of the allegory, which again, *is not necessarily a bad thing.* The characters accomplish their purposes well, one of many realms *Animal Farm* is so well known. 
(I will say my heart twinged a bit when you-know-What happened to Boxer.)

Another shorter example of characters (and by extension books) being used for solely allegory is *Fahrenheit 451.* The world described within the story is basically a well written way of Ray Bradbury saying “I think TV and no books will be the death of us all.” 

(*1984* is also an example of characters for allegory.)

On the other hand, it seems newer dystopians are written more with the characters in mind- a well known example is *The Hunger Games.* Say what you will about the overall quality of the book, I think it’s safe to say it does a pretty good job of balancing its social commentary and love triangles.

Last example is *Munmun.* It’s only two years old, but basically it’s about poor siblings Warner and Prayer, who live in an alternate reality where every person's physical size is directly proportional to their wealth. The book chronicles their attempts to “scale up” by getting enough money (to avoid being eaten by rats and trampled and such.)

Being an incredibly imaginative book aside(highly recommend it), the author does an amazing job of using the story as a very harsh metaphor on capitalism, class, wealth, etc while still keeping tge readers engaged and caring about the main characters.

In short, instead of the characters being in the story for sake of allegory, the characters and story are **enriched** by allegory.

I have a few theories on why this change towards story and characters has happened:

**-** once dystopians became mainstream authors realized they could actually tell realistic human stories in these dystopian worlds 
**-** most genres change over time, dystopian is no exception 
**-** younger people read these dystopian books and identified with the fears expressed in them. Seeing this, publishers or authors or someone then wrote/commissioned new dystopias, but with the allegory and social commentary watered down and sidelined for romance, character, and story, in order to make it more palatable for younger readers.

([Here’s a link](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/c9okhi/new_dystopias_are_more_story_focused_because/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) to where I go into more depth in this last thought)

If you’re still reading this, wow and thanks! What do you think? Anyone had similar thoughts or reading experiences? Anyone agree or disagree? Comment away and let me know!

Edit: to be clear, I’m not saying it’s a bad thing older dystopians use characters for allegory purposes, I’m just pointing it out. So please no one say “it doesn’t matter if the characters are flat!” I know, human. I know.

Second Edit: someone linked this article, it talks about what I’ve noticed, the supposed [decline of dystopian/philosophical novels ](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/20/books/review/whatever-happened-to-the-novel-of-ideas.html) (I can’t remember who linked it, so whoever did, claim credit!)

6kt05j,books,Three Men in a Boat is one of the funniest books I've ever read.,"I often read comedy books, Douglas Adams, P.G Wodehouse, Oscar Wilde, Spike Milligan etc. and have always enjoyed them, but rarely do I find myself laughing out loud while reading. *Three Men in a Boat* is in a class of its own where comedy novels are concerned.

What surprised me so much was how fresh many of the jokes are for a novel written 128 years ago. There were so many great moments, the hedge maze at Hampton Court, the taxidermy trout in a pub in Streatley, or almost any time Montmorency is mentioned.

I cannot recommend this book enough, but if I go on I'll spoil many of its best parts, so I'll leave you with my favourite passage:

>*It always does seem to me that I am doing more work than I should do. It is not that I object to the work, mind you; I like work; it fascinates me. I can sit and look at it for hours.*

>*I love to keep it by me; the idea of getting rid of it nearly breaks my heart.*

>*You cannot give me too much work; to accumulate work has almost become a passion with me; my study is so full of it now that there is hardly an inch of room for any more. I shall have to throw out a wing soon*

>*And I am careful of my work, too. Why, some of the work that I have by me now has been in my possession for years and years, and there isn't a finger mark on it. I take a great pride in my work; I take it down now and then and dust it. No man keeps his work in a better state of preservation than I do.*

EDIT: Too many replies now for me to answer them all individually. I'm very glad so many of you already know and love the book. If you're looking to read it, as others have pointed out, there is a free version on Kindle and a free audiobook version on Spotify, though apparently the Hugh Laurie version is abridged.

If it's not your cup of tea, hey that's fine too. Horses for courses.

down the son of Anthemion, Simoeisios, 

in the full bloom of youth. On the slopes of Ida

descending, by the banks of clear Simoeis, 

his mother had conceived him, while she kept

a vigil with her parents over the flocks; 

he got his name for this. To his dear parents

he never made return for all their care, 

but had his life cut short when Ajax’s shaft

unmanned him. In the lead, as he came on, 

he took the spear-thrust squarely in the chest

beside the nipple on the right side; piercing him, 

the bronze point issued by the shoulder blade, 

and in the dust he reeled and fell. 

A poplar growing in bottom lands, in a great meadow, 

smooth-trunked, high up to its sheath of boughs, 

will fall before the chariot-builder’s ax, ...

and, seasoning, it lies beside the river. 

So vanquished by the god-reared Ajax lay

Simeoisios Anthemides.

- Homer’s *Iliad*, Book IV

One of my very favorite passages in all of world literature is the death of this random Trojan soldier, Simeoisios, who isn’t mentioned anywhere else in Homer’s epic outside of these brief few lines. The fragility of life, the cyclical nature of conception and birth and death, the violence of war and the death of young Simeoisios juxtaposed with the violence of the ax and the gradual, languid rotting of the poplar... In a few lines, we see an entire life from beginning to end, and it’s not cheap or distracting but ethereally beautiful. The descriptions are just enough that you can picture his parents conceiving him on the banks of the river that gave him his name, his parents realizing they will never see their son again, the blood and dust of the fields of Troy, and the slow decay of a felled tree, each scene a perfect successor to the previous. Plus, a major theme of Homer’s epics is that quest for immortality which in our mortal, corporal world is only possible through glory, honor, and legacy. A premature death in battle is the secret to life-everlasting in the minds of men. And this unremarkable soldier achieved it in these few brief lines, and now his death is still read about eons later. It’s probably one of the most perfect pieces of writing I’ve read, and I can’t imagine anyone having a more beautiful or emotional elegy."

Some of the picks were ridiculous (The Bible?), and some a little heavy-handed (*The Prince*?). I guess my problem with lists like these is that they are so long and sprawling. What do I do when I read them all? Grow a beard and barbecue a pig? What's the end goal?

I think these sorts of lists should be smaller and less preachy. So what I am going to do is share a list of books that profoundly influence me as the human being, adult, and man I am. My goal is to share some good stuff. Hopefully people read this, get into these books and writers, and are touched by these stories and ideas. One of my professors said we read fiction to learn how to live better, which is kinda corny but also a little true. So here is my list. Trying not to go too far into summaries. 

1. *Fight Club* by Chuck Palahniuk. Tough lead here. It's a book that's as much about alienation as it is about machismo and nihilism. It's scary that many of us in the early throes of adulthood are lost in the sense that we hit a certain age, get a diploma and/or a job, and stop and say ""now what? Is this what the rest of my life is going to be?"" Tyler Durden is like the manic pixie dreambro, an agent of chaos who can save the world by breaking it, or so he has you convinced. This is a book that speaks to the disenchantment of my generation, built to reach the stars only to graduate into a much colder world, and the thing about *Fight Club* is that it shows how badly insecure people want an answer, any answer. 

2. *Ask the Dust* by John Fante. Arturo Bandini is a young man in his early 20s trying to make it as a writer in LA in the 1930's. It's so easy to relate to him, because as a narrator, he's so candid. He makes his guilt, shame, pride, ego, failure, success all so palpable that it's like I'm right there beside him. It's a good counter to *Fight Club* because it's less cynical, more hopeful, and yet cripplingly tragic in a very soft-spoken way (read the book and that will make sense). This is the second in the ""Bandini Quartet,"" four novels featuring Fante's alter ego. You don't need to read the first for any context here--they all stand alone very well. What's the book about? The reality of chasing one's dreams. 

3. *East of Eden* by John Steinbeck. I really wanted to avoid the run of the mill classics here, because duh, if you are a reader, you should read the classics. This book transcends a classic. It's about fathers and sons, heroes and whores. It's a tome, but it really picks up steam about 200 pages in, and it's so gripping. It's about growing old, and family, and trying to make things right, pride, honor--it's got so much important stuff, and Steinbeck can be subtle, I love the man, but he has no problem hitting you over the head in this one from time to time. 

4. [""Winter Dreams""](http://www.gutenberg.net.au/fsf/WINTER-DREAMS.txt) by F. Scott Fitzgerald. This is a short story, and I linked to a crummy PDF. Heart wrenching tale about love. This is one of the stories he wrote while he tried out a bunch of the Gatsby ideas. It's a growing up sort of story. 

5. *Sirens of Titan* by Kurt Vonnegut. I love me some Vonnegut. He's so very good. This is one that falls outside of his ""classics."" He fools around with time being a set single line, Tralfamadorians, and his general absurdist take on everyday life. This is a novel about hope, failure, loss, and redemption. A man (and his dog) who has come unstuck from time figures out a way to save the world and humanity. It's Vonnegut's second novel, and I think it's his best, but I also think all of his stuff is incredible. 

So that's my list. There's lost more, but those are 5 good ones. I don't pretend to say these are some definitive texts. Just really good ones that I like and have inspired me. 

Happy reading. 

EDIT: I am glad this post has taken off a bit. Keep sharing these poignant novels and stories. If you do ""Winter Dreams"" and like it, follow it up with ""Babylon Revisited."" "

 I used to read constantly, every single day I'd be reading from when I woke up, during class, when I got home, at night. For 6 years, I have barely touched a book. I have so much time on my hands but I've wasted it with TV shows and movies and games which barely catch my interest. Just passing time.

 (edit: I don't mean that video games, tv and movies are a waste, I just have been watching garbage because I've already watched all the movies, shows and played all the games that I enjoy.) 

 About two weeks ago, I downloaded a reading app on my phone, got about 300 ebooks. Books I've wanted to read for years, every genre that I love, and got right into it.

I finished my first book, The Last Wish in three days, then I started the Long Walk, which I also finished in three days, then Annihilation which took me about a full day of reading.

These books made my imagination swirl and my heart felt tense, I was absolutely enamoured with how much I loved reading them. How intense they felt compared to movies and tv shows, it reminded me of why I loved books. 

Now I'm reading Paradox Bound, I opened the book and read for 8 hours straight, barely taking a break for food or water. I got about half way through the book in a single session, unable to put it down. I'm absolutely  loving it. It just gets better, the first few chapters I slogged through but once I got to a point where my interest catched, I was hooked and I cannot stop reading.

I've organized all my books, both physical and digital, I've created spreadsheets for Page Numbers, Read Order, Series Orders. I've set goals for myself. Every book I read, I'm writing a page long review for my favourite parts, my dislikes, the parts I hated. 

I'm still depressed but now I can read, so that makes it better :) 

All I want to do now is read more.

The bookstore wasn't perfect, it didn't have much room to move around in nor did it have a lounge area where you could sit down like some new bookstores are doing. But the owner and the employees were helpful with a wide breath of knowledge and very happy about their job, willing to share everything.

I remember around 10 years ago I was very into detective novels and wanted to read Arsene Lupin but couldn't find it anywhere online in Sweden or any bookstore. But I went there and they managed to find a copy, ordered it for me and let me check out the contents for a few minutes before I had to pay. I read that book around the time my great grandmother passed away and I won't forget about either of them for as long as I live.

There was no new owner of the bookstore and we won't be getting another one. With the online stores being so simple to order from and with a large variety of books I doubt people will want jsut another run of the mill bookstore. 

Why didn't the owner of the bookstore try to innovate you might be wondering? It all comes down to rent. We even had a bakery close down due to bancruptcy and that just sounds absurd to me. Our city centre have a handful local businesses left, every other store is a large chain.

My only real let down was the ending, dont get me wrong the big assault on the Emperor's ship was awesome but the way the book just says Paul's son is dead and not showing us and how he gets the Emperor's Court to come to the old Atreides palace just to kill Feyd-Rautha and demand the Princess Irulan, I just thought the book could of had more there. Another thing that let me down was Paul in the end becoming almost a monster and nothing like the way his father ruled, his own mother was afraid of him and she was a badass; also Gurney not getting to kill a Harkonnen was a bit unsatisfying. All these things made the book all the more interesting and I loved them but they were still a little disappointing. This book and all the interesting aspects, like still suits, Mentats, the Bene Gesserit, the Makers, will always be apart of my mind. I'm now going to move onto Dune Messiah and Children of Dune and I have no clue what I'm getting into. I'd like to know what some of you guys thought of Dune."

876e81,books,"After 3.5 years of college killed my ability to read for fun, I finally challenged myself to read one book each month and have been loving it!","As the title says, college has really killed my ability to read for fun. With a really intensive major/minor plus being in our honors department as well, any time I spent reading for pleasure I just felt guilty that I wasn’t doing homework or reading assigned readings. Now that I’m about to graduate I was looking back and realized I only read 1 maybe 2 books each year for fun, and those were usually during the summer when I actually had time. For my New Years resolution I decided to give myself a break and re-read my favorite series that I haven’t read since 8th grade, The Sword of Truth series by Terry Goodkind. There are 12 books in the main series and 12 months in the year so I figured one book each month for the year would get me back on track with actually reading for fun and it is really working! This last weekend I sat down and read for 7 hours STRAIGHT before I realized just how long I had been sitting there. I feel like my vocabulary has improved so much, not to mention I’m spending less time on my phone since every time I notice myself wasting time on social media I think to myself “man why am I not using this time to read???”

Just thought I would share! I haven’t posted here before so sorry if this type of post isn’t allowed or whatever! If anybody has had a similar experience I’d love to hear about it, or tips to challenge myself further once I graduate and have more free time!

EDIT: this post blew up way more than I expected! My first gold!!!

ko1vsu,books,Oh my god ‘and then there were none’ by Agatha Christie had me throwing the book across the room 🤯🤯,"Just finished ‘and then there were none’. That has to be the most ingenious and best mystery book I’ve ever read. I have been sitting here for half an hour trying to compute what I just read. I cannot express in words how bloody amazing it was. You all must read it! Christie really is the queen of mystery. 
🤯🤯🤯🤯😭😭😭😭

For those of you who aren’t aware, it is a mystery story where 10 strangers are invited to an island, on which they become stranded, and they start getting picked off one by one. 
I also thought it was so incredibly chilling, more so than most of her other books too. The way she wove the web of mystery, skullduggery and suspense was masterful. The nursery rhyme also added a sense of impending doom to myself as the reader. Really clever utilisation of dramatic irony. And the ending was just a punch to the balls! 
I am not surprised in the slightest that this is the highest selling mystery book of all time!

Edit: thank you all so much for the other recommendations. Once I’ve finished all the other books on my list - I’ve got 40 - I’ll get round to all these. They all sound amazing!

Edit 2: I’m so glad I convinced so many of you to pick the book up. I hope you all enjoy it and be sure to return to this post and leave your thoughts when you’re finished! However, I recommend starting on ‘The Murder of Roger Ackoryd’, if you haven’t read any Agatha Christie before - it’s a better introduction to her work. Then read ‘And Then There Were None’.

Edit 3: some people thought i included a spoiler when it wasn’t so to shut them up i’ve removed it. and also, to the trolls - shush.

Edit 4 (god I’m doing a lot of these 😅): thanks to those of you recommended the BBC/Charles Dance adaptation. It was good. I wish they had made it more true to the book, but it was still enjoyable viewing. Charles Dance was excellent. After you’ve finished the book, you ought to watch it. Felt that it wasn’t as chilling as the book, but that might just be because I know the ending lol."

8gt5m8,books,In Defense of Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy,"This started off as a reply to someone who said he had read Hitchhikers Guide and didn’t really get it. I looked at the comments and there was a mixture of agreement and defense of the books.  But as I read further, although there were a decent number of comments, I realized that nobody who had replied really saw the books the way I do. 

Now, I don’t claim to be a superior intellect or any kind of literary critic of note, but in seeing those comments, i realized that a lot of people, even those who enjoy it, seem to have missed the point entirely (or at least the point that I took away from it). So, here is my response reproduced in its entirety in the hopes that it will inspire people to read, or reread, these masterpieces. 

So I’m responding to this maybe a month late but I guess I have three basic thoughts about how I’ve always seen Hitchhikers that I feel like most respondents didn’t capture. 

The first, and most simplistic view of it is that there’s just general silliness around. The people get into silly situations, react stupidly, and just experience random funny stuff. 

The second, still fairly easy to see bit is Adams just generally making fun of the sci-fi genre. He loves to poke fun at their tropes and describe them ridiculously. 

The final bit though is why I think this series is a true masterpiece. In a way, even though Earth gets demolished in the first few pages of the first book, the characters never really leave. All the aliens they encounter behave fundamentally like humans, with all of our foibles and oddities. 

The first time he does it, he really hammers you over the head with it to try to clue you on what he’s on about. A rude, officious, uncaring local government knocks down Arthur’s house - where he lives - in the name of efficiency. The government doesn’t care about the effect on Arthur’s life. What happens next? A bureaucratic alien race demolishes our entire planet, with all of its history, art, and uniqueness, to make way for a hyperspace bypass that literally doesn’t make any sense and isn’t needed anyway. 

In a lot of ways Arthur’s journey reminds me of The Little Prince, a fantastic book in which a childlike alien boy travels from meteor to meteor and meets various adults like a king, a drunkard, or a businessman. They all try to explain themselves to the little prince who asks questions with childlike naïveté that stump the adults. 

Adams is doing the same thing. The Vogons he used as a double whammy to attack both British government officials and awful, pretentious, artsy types. What’s worse than awful poetry at an open mic night and government officials? How about a government official that can literally force you to sit there and be tortured to death by it!

My absolute favorite bit in the entire series is in the second book which you haven’t read (yet, hopefully).  In the original version of the book he uses the word “fuck”. It was published in the UK as is, but the American publisher balked at printing that book with that word in it. 

Adams’s response? He wrote this entire additional scene in the book about how no matter how hardened and nasty any alien in the Galaxy was, nobody, and I mean nobody, would ever utter the word “Belgium.” Arthur is totally perplexed by this and keeps saying it trying to understand, continually upsetting everyone around him. The concept is introduced because someone won an award for using the word “Belgium” in a screenplay. The entire thing is a beautifully written takedown of American puritanical hypocrisy and the publishing industry’s relationship with artists. 

Adams uses Arthur’s adventures to muse on the strange existential nature of human existence. He skewers religion, atheists, government, morality, science, sexuality, sports, finance, progress, and mortality just off the top of my head. 

He is a true existential absurdist in the vein of Monty Python. The scenarios he concocts are so ridiculous, so bizarre, that you can’t help but laugh at everyone involved, even when he’s pointing his finger directly at you. 

Whether it’s a pair of planets that destroyed themselves in an ever escalating athletic shoe production race, their journey to see God’s final message to mankind, or the accidental discovery about the true origins of the human race, there is a message within a message in everything he writes. 

I encourage you to keep going and actually take the time to read between the lines. You won’t regret it. 

EDIT: This is the first post I've written on Reddit that blew up to this extent. I've been trying to reply to people as the posts replies roll in, but I'm literally hundreds behind and will try to catch up. I've learned a lot tonight, from both people who seemed to enjoy my post, people who felt that it was the most obvious thing in the world to write, and people who seem to bring to life one of the very first lines of the book, ""This planet has—or rather had—a problem, which was this: most of the people living on it were unhappy for pretty much all of the time.""

In retrospect maybe I shouldn't have posted this on a Thursday.

I've also learned that I should spend more time in a subreddit before posting on it; apparently this book is quite popular here and a lot of people felt that I could have gone more out on a limb by suggesting that people on the internet like cats on occasion. This has led me to understand at least part of the reason why on subreddits I'm very active on I see the same shit recycle a lot... I'm gonna have a lot more sympathy for OPs who post popular opinions in the future.

do5jqy,books,Has anyone read Harry Potter as an adult for the first time and recommends it?,"Even thought I’m exactly the age in where Harry Potter peaked, I never read the books. Not because I wasn’t a reader, but precisely because of that. I remember being kinda mad at everyone adult telling me “oh, you read all the time? You must have devoured the HP books like my son did”. HP was so ubiquitous that a contrarian spirit grew in me. Also, I was at that age in where I was feeling proud of reading “mature” books and reading stuff for children (even though that’s what I was) felt beneath me.

So, the whole phenomenon passed me by. Never saw the movies either. Now in my early 30s I feel like I’ve missed out on a big cultural touchstone. 

Would it make any sense to go back and pick up the books from the start? Do they hold up as an adult?

This book completely changed my perspective on how I view society, as well as, our own government.  The Party seeks power entirely for its own sake. It is not interested in the good of others; it is interested solely in power. In a way, this is not far off from our own government systems, leading me to believe we are not as ""free"" as one would think. 

To this day, my thoughts on these matters have never been the same prior to reading this book.

While Harry Potter is the norm for what most people in my generation grew up with, I was far fonder of Artemis Fowl - although I did read the HP series.

One of my favorite parts of the series was the end of The Eternity Code where Artemis emerges victorious in the battle of wits over his stolen technology.

*“And one more thing. About my name — Artemis — you were right. In London, it is generally a female name, after the Greek goddess of archery.

Calvin was like me, kinda: a bratty kid who liked to learn, but who didn't want to learn what was taught to him in school. I used to try to emulate Calvin in elementary school, often with negative results (but when you're lost in your imagination you tend not to notice as much.) Bill Watterson I don't think realized how much his readership extended beyond hip college-aged people, to adults (seniors, even) and the kind of kid (like me) who read the funnies over their bowl of cereal in the morning. I still love them, still read them. In that way, the entire collected series is in itself like a ""book"" in the sense that we know them. Hell, I dated a girl with kids, and not one of the books they read had even 1/2 the imaginativeness of a single C&H strip. I see people who don't know any better with their bootleg shirts and just have to shake my head, knowing how hard he fought for creative control over his creation, and it bugs me, but not so much that I can't look past it. Now we live in a world where the written word has become such an ""old concept"" that it's barely used, but back when I was a kid, you'd read a strip and have to look up a word in the dictionary and that made the strip that much funnier.

I’ve been reading a lot lately, and buying big stacks from Thrift Stores. Thought I’d give it a shot because it was short, probably light, and something that has always felt “unread” to me. Beckoning to me. 

I was floored. This book is incredible. One-sitting, a couple hours, and I looked up and was not the same as I was when I first looked down. I was expecting something very childish, but this is a real dystopian story that follows a boy I’d describe as a hero. It is a more accessible, less “fantastical” version of the Neverending Story in its theme, it’s got a dash of Fahrenheit 451 which has always been a favorite, and I’m seriously peeved I didn’t read it as a kid but extremely glad I finally made the decision as an adult. 

If you haven’t read it, read it. Beautiful, beautiful story, deserving of all its acclaim. If I was an English teacher I’d be psyched, knowing this book existed. It teaches every literary device. Need to show someone Imagery? The whole book is about appreciating real imagery, and the words you use to describe it. Need characterization, static vs dynamic, need symbolism, need foreshadowing? It’s all there and some of it even defines itself. 

Dark, too. Surprising, poetic delivery of some very disturbing scenes. I almost can’t appreciate a book unless there’s an element of darkness and this satisfied.

l0lope,books,I didn't think Lolita would mess me up so bad.,"Sorry if gushy posts about how a book made me cry aren't allowed, but Jesus Christ man. 

I knew what Lolita was before I read it. I knew it was about a sick, evil man ""falling in love"" with a little girl and taking advantage of her after her mother dies. But I think going into the book with this knowledge actually made it MORE difficult to come to terms with. 

I hated Humbert. He's evil, he's deranged, and I wanted to feel happy when he died. But I couldn't. When he killed Clare Quilty and drove recklessly, covered in his blood, so detached from anything, I cried. I hate Humbert, and the book was so wonderfully written that I actually empathized with him, and I was lowkey disgusted with myself for it. I know he's the epitome of an unreliable narrator and that he spends the duration of his confession lying to himself and the reader, but I actually caught myself feeling sorry for him. He's a deranged man, destroyed by an obsession that drove him to destroy the lives of others. 

But then I realized... I was falling for Humbert's trap. That is what Humbert WANTED me to feel. He made me feel his suffering, his fear, his pain so deeply that I nearly forgot about Dolores, the real victim of the story. He destroyed her. He completely destroyed her and I was almost too blinded by Humbert's misery to see it, and yet it's plain as day. When he was killing Clare, I caught myself feeling like Humbert was a man, hopelessly in love, destroyed by that love, and he had that love torn from him and was left with nothing. Humbert wanted the reader to feel that way. 

Humbert didn't love Dolores. He loved the idea of her. He was so obsessed with his sick idea of ""nymphets"" that he completely forgot that they were just kids. He was so obsessed with Dolores, put her on such a high pedestal that he completely forgot that she was a person, a HUMAN BEING who he utterly destroyed. And I was so blinded by the tale of a man losing himself in insanity, to the point where I was crying because I FELT SORRY for this miserable sack of shit, that I too forgot for a moment that Dolores was a person, a child, and she was the one who was actually the victim in all of this. That probably sounds insane to anyone who hasn't read the book and that's because it is. Dolores lost her mother, her friends, her innocence, her WHOLE LIFE and it was old poor Humbert that I caught myself crying for.

a month goes by and i end up in the same book store to buy a magazine, and i saw the book again and i was like ""screw it ill just buy it"". Boy am i glad i did. I read 100 pages as soon as i got home. my mind was literally blown with every page turn. I cheered in some parts, out loud, over a book....lol. It just astounds me how a book written primarily though the 1940s is still SO relevant today. The theories of psychohistory are so well fleshed out they nearly sound like they could be a legitimate statistical mathematics. The idea that man has gathered so much data over the 12,000 year reign of the empire that they can use that data to accurately predict futures is just such solid foundation for a story. Then how it kind of just flips into the future with totally new characters that relate to the old ones. The excerpts from the Encyclopedia Galactica.

3l1epw,books,How to scam amazon customers out of $100k a year.,"Do you know Dagny Taggart? She's a character in Atlas Shrugged. She's also a best selling author of language learning ebooks on Amazon. She speaks 15 languages apparently. According to her bio, she spends her life traveling and picking up languages along the way.

There's just one problem, Dagny Taggart doesn't exist. Her bio is fake, her profile picture is a stock photo. The books she writes are full of errors because they are written by a person (or perhaps a group of people) that doesn't actually speak the language and is just copying and writing in her own words what she learns from free language learning websites. 

Despite the glaring errors in her books that are obvious to anyone that can actually speak the language, her books are well reviewed, 4.5 out of 5 stars on almost every single one. There are the top selling books in every language category. How could this be? Dagny Taggart is paying for fake reviews, and it's working.

I am an indie author. In full disclosure, I must inform the reader that Dagny Taggart is my direct competition. I am losing to her, and not just her, most of the best selling language learning ebooks are actually just scams. 

It's a relatively easy scam. Go on the internet, look up some topic, usually one where a lot of general information can be learned online (languages, travel, diets, exercise, cooking) write it up in your own words into an ebook, get a professional cover, pay a company to write fake reviews for you, and BAM, you have a steady income stream. I estimate from my own sales that Dagny Taggart's books have scammed hundreds of thousands of dollars out of people in this year alone. 

So why hasn't Amazon put a stop to this? Why are fake reviews so rampant despite Amazon's best efforts? Amazon has taken a few actions. Recently, they have weighted the reviews of verified purchases, which is a good step, but can easily be overcome in the ebook world. Amazon has also brought lawsuits against the companies that sell fake reviews, another good step, but if there is a market for something, it will always exist.

There is actually an easy fix to this scam. Something that Amazon has missed completely: **average number of reviews over sales**. My own book was downloaded over 5000 times in a three month period, which netted me 15 reviews. That's about 3 reviews per 1000 downloads. I imagine other products are similar, but the true statistics only Amazon knows. Some of Dagny Taggart's books received ten reviews on the very first day of publication. This past week, another scammer's book has received over 100 reviews (and counting). Could it be that they each had thousands of downloads on the very first day of publication, or during this past week? No, of course not. They paid professional reviews to astroturf.

The simple solution is to red flag products that receive reviews in excess of the R/S ratio (reviews over sales), investigate the authors that are scamming the system, unpublish their works, refund their customers, and ban them from publishing again. Of course, there is a flaw in this as well, someone might pay a company to write fake reviews for their competition in order to get them banned, but if that competition were to contact Amazon and agree to delete the fake positive reviews, perhaps they could be forgiven. 

The big joke is, many of Amazon's top reviewers are professional astroturfers. The criminals have been given badges. It's easy to spot an astroturfer. Just click on their name. They write about ten book reviews a day. How many of you buy more than one book a day on Amazon, let alone buy and review it? They must be the fastest readers in the world! 

**Ultimately, the problem lies in the consumers themselves.** All the information I have told you in this article can easily be found out by anyone who takes the time to check the reviews of a product. In fact, for most of Dagny Taggart's books, the top review is a one star review that tells you all about the scam. A simple glance at the dates the reviews were published will tell you if a product received ten reviews in one hour. Unfortunately, the majority of ebook consumers don't take a few minutes to do their due diligence, they just look for the stars, and so the best selling books remain the ones with the most positive reviews. You may say it's their own fault, buyer beware, but in the end this will hurt all indie publishers when readers realize their purchases were a scam, and lead them to trust Amazon's review system and indie publishers less and less. 

What can we do to get Amazon to implement the simple fix of red flagging works that receive too many reviews per sales? What other solutions do you think would be a good idea? 

**Edit:** Dagny's lawyer has contacted me, thoughts? Can I actually be sued for reddit posts?

I just finished the chapter where Sirius dies, and I'm crying again. 

But, I'm realizing, I'm crying for a different reason this time. 

When I was child, I cried for Harry. I cried for the loss he felt, how he'd wished to live with Sirius and have a real family. I was also abused as a child by a step parent and I clung so strongly onto the books of a child that was in a similar situation to me, but could still make friends and practice magic and go on adventures. I was often left in a closet with a flashlight and 1 book of my choice for hours at a time, and I always chose a HP book. 

Today, I'm crying for Sirius, and for Remus. I'm crying for the intense isolation they both struggled with after Lily and James died. For the couple short years they got to see each other again. I'm crying for Sirius and how much he struggled to stay in one place, alone in the house where he was abused by his mother. How depressed and lonely he was, and how deeply he wished to have a home to share with Harry. I cried for Sirius, because for one jubilant moment, he felt like he was fighting alongside his best friend again after 15 years. And then, in the same moment, he was gone, falling behind a veil of death. I cried for Remus, who the next moment *needed* to be strong for Harry and to talk some sense into the teenager that would have mindlessly followed into the veil. 

I'm still deeply attached to these books and am currently considering how much I have changed as from a girl to a woman, and how this has changed my perspective of these books. The characters I relate to, the situations they're in, etc. 

I just wanted to share this small moment of vulnerability with this sub.

Edit: 

To all the folks telling me to read another book, why are you assuming I am not? I only reread these every few years. I'm also reading Dune, and 1984 right now as I'm catching up on things I wasn't exposed to as a kid. But sometimes I need to go to something more comforting from my past."

hlpjdj,books,I find The Fault in Our Stars overrated,"I was in college when I borrowed this book from a schoolmate. This novel by John Green used to be really popular and I figured that I might give it a try. My dorm roommate even told me to prepare some tissue when she saw me reading this book because she believes I would cry after reading it.

Much to my dismay, this book did not make me shed even a single tear. It is just some typical young adult love story where boy meets pathetic girl, they go on an adventure revolving on making every second count because the girl doesn't have much time left and by some plot twist, it is the boy who dies in the end.

I think it is overrated or have I missed anything?

EDIT: I read this when I was 16 (yes, I was already in college). So, saying that it wasn't for my demographic would be irrelevant. Objectively speaking, I recognize that it is a good point that Green has raised cancer awareness through the book. However, it won't change the fact that the plot is cliché."

60d6gi,books,"A year ago, I spent a week collecting the extracts featuring the worst examples of sex scenes in literature and it was totally worth it","The issue: Since 1993, the Literary Review has been running a now world-famous ‘Bad sex in fiction award’, which aims to highlight and ‘honour’ authors who produce outstandingly bad scenes of sexual description in otherwise good novels. The purpose of the prize is to draw attention to poorly written, perfunctory or redundant passages of sexual description in modern fiction, and to discourage them. 

Quite simply, the award offers a good helping of light, literary-based entertainment. Winners include award-winning writers like Sebastian Faulks and Tom Wolfe. Perhaps the most famous winner was Morrissey in 2015, for the extract of his book ‘List of the lost’, which features barrel-rolling breasts and “otherwise central zones”. 

(Full Morrissey quote/extract here: “At this, Eliza and Ezra rolled together into the one giggling snowball of full-figured copulation, screaming and shouting as they playfully bit and pulled at each other in a dangerous and clamorous rollercoaster coil of sexually violent rotation with Eliza’s breasts barrel-rolled across Ezra’s howling mouth and the pained frenzy of his bulbous salutation extenuating his excitement as it whacked and smacked its way into every muscle of Eliza’s body except for the otherwise central zone.”)

Now, one thing that is curiously lacking on the internet is one full ‘compendium’ where you have all the winning extracts in one place. Perhaps an oversight on the part of the Literary Review, or simply because no one has yet got round to cataloguing all the extracts stretching back well over 20 years. 

Enter, moi. 

Now, I love a good bit of bad sex as much as anyone. And so one Sunday afternoon I decided, since nobody had done it before, it would be a good use of my time to sift through decades of literary archives in search of extraordinarily badly written sex scenes. 

The thing is. I didn’t actually expect it to take as long as it did. 

At first, it was relatively easy. Over the last few years (from about 2013), sites like The Guardian have been publishing the extracts religiously around the time of the awards (November each year). So it was just a case of googling, and copying and pasting. 

Between the early 2000s and 2012, however, things got progressively more difficult as I worked backwards through time. Stories about the awards still existed, but instead of publishing entire extracts, news sites tended instead to just run a news story along the lines of ‘X famous novelist has won the bad sex in fiction award’, and then choose one or two stand out quotes from the novel in question and perhaps add in a quote from the judges at the literary review. 

This wasn’t a major stumbling block, because, thanks to the internet, it was generally possible to use the ‘search’ function on a PDF of an online copy of the book (I had to pay to download the e-book version of one or two novels), and then simply copy the key phrase from the quote of the online news article, and that would bring me to the page of the extract in question. Still, it added a considerable amount of admin, research and reading time to the process – and at this point my Sunday afternoon had become Monday lunchtime and my boss was asking why I hadn’t written that morning’s marketing blog (I was, at the time, working as a marketing content writer). 

Still, I wasn’t prepared for the amount of work that was still to come. 

See, the problem with awards that predate the internet is that the years in the mid to late nineties in which the award was running simply weren’t picked up by any online news outlets. All I had to go on was a list on Wikipedia of the winning authors and the names of the books that won the award. 

This meant the only route available to me was to rent or purchase copies of the outstanding novels. Que a trip to my local library (the wonders of your local library!) and an online book spending spree, (Amazon Prime 15-day free trial, anyone?). This was followed by an intense round of speed reading, running my eyes frantically over each page of text looking for the telltale signs of bad sex: “bulging trousers”, “moans”, “throbbing penises” and “love truncheons”. 

The intense nature of this reading spell had some ill-wanted effects, including the Wednesday evening train journey during which I exclaimed “yes! condom!” with relief as I found the winning passage in Nicholas Royle’s The Matter of the Heart.  

By the end of the week I had (skim)-read six full-length novels and found the ‘winning’ sex scenes of all the books to have won the award at that time (22 in total). I wrote the article, published it, and haven't looked back. 

This might in part be because, on a personal contextual note, this week came during a rather torturous month in which I was breaking up with my SO of three years (whom I also lived with), after discovering she cheated on me. The mind does strange things when heartbroken. 

Whatever the reason, it remains the best time I've ever spent reading about bad sex. 

You can check out the article here - https://nothingintherulebook.com/2016/03/19/bad-sex-in-fiction-awards-the-connoisseurs-compendium/

d36lzm,books,Why aren’t all books which are part of a series clearly labelled as such on the outside?,"It annoys me to no end when I buy a book or borrow it from the library and find out 50 pages in that it’s actually part 2 or more of a series of books. What does the author or publisher or whoever decided to not write something like „Part 2 of the X series“ on the outside have to gain from that? Do they think it will make me buy the earlier part(s)? Because it won’t. I’ll either rely on the callbacks to the earlier book(s) to understand the story or, if it is entirely to confusing, I‘ll just stop reading the book entirely and never buy anything else from the series.

Also, tangentially related, what’s with book series which are labeled as such, but without a number? How am I supposed to know with which book to start?"
4vpvxq,books,When Chuck Palahniuk Sends You A Gift.,"Backstory: 

When I met Chuck Palahniuk at his book signing, I broke down like someone who was meeting their hero, because, honestly, of the top ten people that I admire, he's way, WAY up there. 

During the meet and greet, Chuck and my daughter had their heads together, and hatched a plan. Chuck asked her to write him a letter about me, what I liked, what my dreams were, and who I was as a person. 
She wrote him an amazing letter, and seeing her write such wonderful things about me was honestly a wonderful gift in and of itself. 
During the cover of night, she wrote the letter and passed it on to my husband to mail. 

Today: 
I get a text from my daughter that I have a package waiting at home. I was confused as I had not ordered anything. 
(And trust me when I say today was an awful day.)

I get home and see the box with a note in front of it that says ""This Was Our Secret"". The return address was from Chuck. 

After the tears stopped, the items I began to pull out of this glitter-packed box were each more hilarious and poignant than the next. 
He sent me soap (of COURSE), candles, incense and lots of candy. He sent me birthday candles and miniature sparklers. He sent me funny pens and copies of his tour CDs. 

And the two most important items, a personal letter and a ""bookmark"" that he made himself. It's got to be 4 feet long at minimum, made of pieces of his own mother's jewelry, carved jade and rocks he's picked up during his travels wrapped in the most ridiculous box I had ever seen. 

Knowing that he thought enough of me to give me things that belonged to his mother, things that he's cared enough about to collect, is completely overwhelming. 
  
He literally sent me a box of rocks and glitter, and I couldn't have asked for more. 

Truth be told, he didn't HAVE to do anything. 
I would be just as thrilled to have met him, shook his hand, and moved on. 
He didn't have to find out anything about me. He could have sent me a leftover bookmark from one of his old signings. 

He wanted to know one of his fans. 

I'm not his target demographic. I'm not a weightlifter with a Fight Club tattoo that thinks Tyler Durden was just a guy that fought a lot. 
I'm a middle-aged mother of a teenager that lives in the suburbs with a two car garage and a cat named after a cow noise. 

He CARES about his fans as well as being one of the most brilliant minds of our times. 

And he uses the same brand of soap that we do. How awesome is THAT?

(I suck at posting on Reddit, so I'm adding the link to my imgur below. It's all pictures of us meeting Chuck and of the package and letters. There's only one other picture there, of a hilarious snowman cookie I made a couple of years ago.) 

Enjoy my Chuck Bomb. 

P. S.  Sorry, Chuck, I'm never eating that candy. However, when I finally do open my candy store, it will go in a special display case. 

https://imgur.com/a/cKIVN


Edit:  Ok this is so cool!  I'm loving all the stories!  Thank you everyone. 

Couple of things that I keep getting: 

- I do realize that the ""target demographic"" is different than what I mentioned. That comment was strictly tongue-in-cheek and a bit of a jab at myself and the fact that Tyler would be very disappointed in me as a person. 

- Apparently, some of you think I'm a ""MILF"". I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a bit flattered. It's the makeup. However, I did not ""fangirl over Chuck because he was hot"". They've been teaching women that good book learnin' for at least the past twenty years or so. 
He also did not send me this because I'm a decent-looking female of the species. He does this for MANY fans. 

- Yes. My daughter is awesome, and I have no idea how I've raised such an incredible kid. I can barely keep a houseplant alive.  

- I'm happily married. Regardless of that, please don't make jabs at single mothers, or single parents in general. It's a very difficult job with too little credit. You probably have no idea what it takes. 

- By request:  My Cat's name is Moo. I explained in the comments somewhere where her name came from. I will try with my limited knowledge of imgur to add a picture of her, because cat pictures are awesome.  Yay, I think I've got it. Here's some pictures of Moo with a couple of our hedgehog Edgar thrown in. We lost Edgar earlier this year to old age, and it still makes me sad. https://imgur.com/a/AbKke

- I've tried to respond to everyone in the messages, but no, I do not have his personal address. Or his phone number. Even if I did, I would not violate his privacy that way after he did something so amazing for me. 

Thank you everyone, again!  I've almost forgotten my face being thrown up on today, but not really. That was gross.

Looking back, I am pretty sure what I loved about it when I was younger was the idea of being singled out in your community to receive all the knowledge of society. The passing along of memories and wisdom. But that isn't really what the book is about. Its about being the only person in your society that is awake to the choices you are being denied. Its about population control, thought control, behavior control. 

I have never been a fan of post apocalyptic stories. I much prefer the optimism of bringing humanity back from the brink, or defending goodness in the face of evil. So the fact that nothing in the community can change, and Jonas' only option is to run away and save himself leaves me feeling desolate."

I simply posted an idea from an author who is no longer with us. Whether you agree or disagree with passages in Robert Heinlein's book, Starship Troopers, I believe it is worthwhile to remember the human behind the book. He was a man who, like many of us, served in the military, went through a divorce, shifted from one area to another on the political spectrum, and so on. He was no super villain trying to shove his version of reality on others. He was a science-fiction author who, like many other authors, implanted his ideas into the stories of his books. If he were still alive, I believe he would be delighted to know that his ideas still spark a discussion to this day."

It hooked me up from its very beginning and I enjoyed it to the end.

When I think about it, I find that not only is it a tale, but also a guide, to face adversities and overcome them with whatever resources one may have at hand. From the beginning, it was clear to Mark Whatney (the protagonist) that he had an option to commit painless suicide by taking morphine pills he had with him. But he chose to put up a fight.

And he does not fight his situation in some vague manner. He does it very systematically; by analysing his options and the outcome. He puts his log to good use. Everytime he incurs a problem he writes about them. When there are too many of them (on many occasions he had too many problems to deal with) he takes them one by one rather than getting overwhelmed by all of them together.

When there's something to be worried about, from the future, he puts it to hold until he comes to that moment. He is very specific about his problems and equally specific about their solutions.

That's how I have been facing my own problems. I write them down in my diary. I try to take them one by one. 

Although it is a work of fiction but I believe that it still manages is to teach how to face problems."

I love those books; the dog eared pages, scribbled notes in the margins, and ancient library stamps.  They bring history and character to my classroom, and my children know that real people somewhere cared enough to send them books, and their own books at that.  In addition to these well loved, amazing books, your donations allowed me to order an entire classroom set of novels, over 75 different books that range over so many different topics and areas of the literary world.

hrajzl,books,I read Too Much and Never Enough (Mary Trump's book) and finished it today! [review],"Hey friends! This was my day today- at a mere 250 pages/6 and a half hour audiobook, it didn't take too long for me to finish this! I know some folks were curious so I wanted to share my thoughts!

How do you nurture a sociopath?

If you were not aware, this book is written by Donald Trump's niece Mary. It is a VERY short book, but it is very good and entertaining 100% of the way through.

So let's break down a little bit about what this book is exactly. You aren't going to find any state secrets here. For anyone asking ""Why Didn't Mary speak out earlier"", this is addresses, but this is isn't a political expose. At it's heart, Too Much and Never Enough is a story about an extremely twisted family, that is much about the other Trumps as it is Donald.

Nothing in this book would sway a true believer. Nothing here is going to rock the world of an undecided voter- because this is a book about who the Trumps are as people. We have already seen Trump mock women, non white folks, disabled people. We have seen him do so many evil things. If you don't know who Trump is by now, I don't really know what to say about you. Too Much and Never Enough is this woman's catharsis- its a way for her to release her trauma. Her book chronicles essentially, how she was became disenchanted with her family before 45 ever decided to run for office, how she was disinherited, and where Fred Trump comes into play as a lynchpin at the center of it all.

Mary's father, Fred Trump junior, was an outlier. Not necessary a good man, but a complicated one who had made a number of visible mistakes before she was even born. She describes his dark relationship with his brother, and her father's slow physical and mental decline as he falls out of favor with Fred Senior. Much of this book is really told through her father's eyes, and through the stories he told her before his passing.

Mary's grandfather Fred is also hi lighted as an abuser that gaslit and traumatized his children, saw the evil in his own younger son, and then raised him as an ideal son to take on the family name. Fred Senior's cruelty towards everyone around him, and shady business practices help shaped the monster we now know today as 45.

As for Donald Trump- Mary uses a number of personal and family stories to paint a picture of Trump's youth. Trump's behavior doesn't come out of thin air, and Mary is really able to paint a picture of 45 at his darkest, which started at a much earlier age than some may expect. These personal stories are chilling and callous- often reflecting his relationships with the American people during his four years as president.

You get some interesting little tidbits about ""modern"" behavior from the family as well, from small squabbles to election night anecdotes. Imagine the literary families of Long days Journey Into the Night or Haunting of Hill House. The Trump family in Mary's book is almost laughably literary ""broken wealthy"". The story of the rise and fall of the Trumps plays out like a screenplay. Later on in the book, Mary talks a lot more about contending with Donald and the family personally as she is disinherited. 

I highly recommend Too Much and Never Enough, even if you don't find yourself often drawn towards non fiction- if only because this is a simple and easy to follow biography that helps us understand how we got where we are now. How Donald Trump, against all odds, rose in the ranks of his own family from a younger ""second son"", and ended up making all of us pay for his neurosis.

I think most folks would go into this worried that Mary is providing excuses or sympathy for her family, and I can assure you that is not the case. Mary is an exceptional author and intelligent woman who makes no excuses for her family, and manages to tell a hard and painful story with striking objectivity and honesty."
k5dtp1,books,Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents by Lindsay C. Gibson is a must read for all of us who grew up with toxic parents.,"Having grown in a pretty toxic environment, I was always confused by the vast difference between the communication my friends had with their parents and I had with my parents and this book helped me understand why.

The book gives an indepth information about how different types of emotional toxicity impacts kids.

This book made me look at my parents from an objective  point of view and not take it personally and that their behaviour towards me doesn't have to define me. 

One thing I'd have loved is if the author could have included an in-depth chapter on how we can overcome those same toxic behaviour in ourselves, which we find in our parents, but she did include few points on how to effectively communicate though.

All in all this is a must read to people who want to break free from their parents toxic cycle and get an understanding of the trauma they faced in their childhood. 


As a child of an abusive father and an explosive mother, I had very hard time understanding my past. I had so many whys and what-ifs and regrets and you know what, it doesn't matter anymore. What's happened has happened and what's going to happen is in our hands and we owe it to our childhood self to be better."

So why is the book so very different from popular cultures interpretations of the book and its monster. 
Am I not understanding it? 
It seems the monster is not a monster at all. He feels and thinks. 

Not to mention a load of extra story that I’ve never seen in the movie or media on the book. 

So are the movies based on other things? Did they just change it all for some reason?"
a263ff,books,An Open Letter to Libraries and The People That Run Them,"As a kid I loved going to the library, getting a bunch of books and reading them, and returning for more. I loved them to the point that one of my “saddest” moments as a child was my mom breaking a promise to take me to the library. We went the next day, but as a kid who had nothing to judge it against, it was rough. Eventually I began growing up and like many people my library usage dwindled. I still had positive feelings towards them, but it wasn’t convenient for me or I was distracted by other things. I just stopped having a need for it. Since I stopped going to the library, my reading dwindled. While my family got the Harry Potter books as they came out, I didn’t do much reading beyond that and required reading for school. 

Fast forward to 16 years old and me moving from California to Canada, and I was nearly cut off from reading completely, that is until I learned my school had a library, and I began reading at a pace I had never done before. I read 31 books in 3 months, a couple I had read before but most were new. My school had AR reading Points, and while we were required to get 25 points, I got 469. However girlfriends, videogames, and reddit took me away from reading. I read very little after that for a few years. Until I learned of Overdrive (now Libby), which allowed me to download books from my local Library straight to my phone. Again my reading use climbed. I think at this point I should mention that while I grew up middle class, by this point I was firmly poor, as I continue to be today. 

At the end of High school I had a crazy idea. I decided to walk across the US. 4,500 miles of walking over the course of roughly a year. I spent anywhere from 8-16 hours a day walking and would often go a few days without talking to people. My journey was about more than travel it was about self-improvement and experiencing things I’d never gotten to before. To that end I would download audiobooks and I listened to many of the classics I had never read before. It made many days pass by quicker and helped me retain my sanity. I would have never been able to afford those audiobooks myself. When I finished my trip, I had crossed 18 states, worn out 8 pairs of shoes, and listened to/read over 40 books from The Count of Monte Cristo to His Dark Materials, to the Art of War. 

When I returned home I began to follow my local library and would occasionally see new programs it would have in the news. A couple years ago they got 3D printers and so, redditor that I am, printed off a Snoo to bring to meetups. While I was there, there was about an 8 year old girl who was 3D printing some little plastic keychain tags for her friends. I was amazed that she even knew how to do that. Then earlier this year they started loaning out GoPro Kits and so on Labour Day, a friend and I hitchhiked up north a bit to go camping and made a video of the trip. As someone who is low income, the Library has helped me to do things I would never have been able to do, and in some cases, never would have thought to do. My library has also put a recording studio in one of the branches and has many other programs such as a podcast listening club (book club but for podcasts), they allow you to digitize old photos, move VHS and CD’s to digital files, give help on research, allow you to read magazines and newspapers from around the world (literally as the stuff is published), borrow museum/regional park passes, and so much more. While I had thought that being able to download ebooks/audiobooks to my phone would mean I’d never have to go to the library again, all of the other offerings my library has makes me keep going back. My life has had many periods of off-and-on again library usage, and it may continue, but I know that when I need it, it will be there for me. 

I would like to say thank you to all the librarians (and library technicians!) that have helped me. Some have helped me find books, some have kept the library organized, some have gotten added books I recommended to the collection, and some have ensured the Library continues to grow, evolve, and keep bringing me back. I can say with certainty that my life would be genuinely worse without the Library. Keep up the good work and I’ll see you tomorrow when I have to return The Marrow Thieves.

>What he feared more than anything else was that she would simply change her mind if he did not get in touch with her quickly.

>...Then for three dreadful days she did not appear at all. His whole mind and body seemed to be afflicted with an unbearable sensitivity...

>...Even in sleep he could not altogether escape from her image... 

>...He had absolutely no clue as to what had happened to her.  There was no enquiry he could make. She might have been vaporised, she might have committed suicide, she might have been transferred to the other end of Oceania: worst and likeliest of all, she might simply have changed her mind and decided to avoid him.

>...On the following day he very nearly succeeded in speaking to her. When he came into the canteen she was sitting at a table well out from the wall, and was quite alone....

>...He walked casually towards her, his eyes searching for a place at some table beyond her. She was perhaps three meters away from him. Then a voice behind him called, 'Smith!' He pretended not to hear. 'Smith!' repeated the voice, more loudly. It was no use.
He turned round. A blond-headed, silly -faced young man named Wilsher, whom he barely knew, was inviting him with a smle to a vacant place at his table. It was not safe to refuse. After having been recognised, he cold not go and sit at a table with an unattended girl. It was too noticeable. He sat down with a friendly smile. The silly blond face beamed into his. Winston had a hallucinations of himself smashing a pickaxe right into the middle of it. The girl's table filled up a few minutes earlier.

While Winston struggled to make contact with her because of fear being caught by the Thought Police, I could not help but have flashbacks when I was in Middle and High School, when I couldn't stop thinking about that cute girl and finally gathered enough courage to make the first move, only to have my friends fuck it all up...

fxtzpo,books,"Just Finished Lolita, Could this book have become a classic if published today?","I thought it was a really interesting story, a page turner where I wanted to find out what happened next. 
However, man oh man is it disturbing. Ultimately, it’s about a Man who kidnaps and rapes a 12 year old girl repeatedly and showers her with lavish gifts in return. And the whole thing is told from his perspective, very rarely does Dolores speak and we’re never granted an entry to her thoughts. Instead, we are subjected to the perverse mind of H.H. and the justifications he provides for his actions. 
I wonder how this book would have been received if published today. Would it be more controversial,  would it still be lauded as a great work, would it be doomed to obscurity? Curious to get others thoughts."
dufsfe,books,Ender’s Game by Orson Scott Card,"I just finished Ender’s Game not even five minutes ago and I am astounded. The ending was so peaceful and perfectly contrasted with the violence that took up most of the story. It’s also interesting to note that one of the main characters was Maori, something I’ve never come across in a book before. The decision to have a character of Pacific Islander heritage is in no doubt due to Orson Scott Card’s time spent in Utah. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I will definitely be scouring the local used book stores here for its sequel.

Edit: Apparently, Orson Scott Card’s remarks towards homosexuals were far more viscous than I first believed. I was not aware of the racist and sexist remarks he had made as well. Pretty eye opening, tbh."

ebf6mb,books,Unpleasant revelations and reading fantasy with my 10-year-old...,"My son is turning into an avid reader, but he still likes to hear me read to him before bed. I've been using that as an opportunity to introduce him to some of my favorite books. He's already read Harry Potter and the Percy Jackson series himself. Together we read *The Hobbit* and *The Lord of the Rings*. It took some time reading it a chapter a night, but we both enjoyed it.

So...at the used book store, I picked up a book I remembered reading when I was much younger...*The Source of Magic* by Piers Anthony. (Yep, some of you are probably already knowing where this is going.) My rose-colored memories of Xanth remember the silly puns and personal quests of the protagonists. What I didn't recall so much was the blatant misogyny. Anthony seems to hate women, if the regular insults to their character, intelligence and worth are any measure. I've had to tell my son several times that I find any reference to women in the books to be awful. I'm trying to use it as a teaching experience...but it has soured some of my remembrances, and it makes me wonder how terrible some of the other stories I read in the 70's and 80's were. (I'm not reading a 10-year-old Heinlein, so don't worry about that.)

I guess the moral is that sharing something you love with your kids can sometimes make you realize that your memories tend to be filtered by your understanding at the time. I think I need to be a bit more cautious in the future.

UPDATE:  Wow...I disappeared into a meeting for 7 hours (don't ask), and came out to find this explosion. So...

1) Thank you very much to everybody who has recommended alternates. Pratchett and McCaffrey are two that I'm seriously considering...and I'm going to look into some of the authors I haven't read to see if they're a) appropriate and b) stuff that I would enjoy. Thanks to the person who gave me a silver, too.

2) My primary issue with Robert Heinlein is how some of his works are a little TOO into the whole free love agenda, and what I perceived as some really racist aspects of his writing. Some folks here have convinced me that the latter may just be really inept attempts to address the topic. Still not planning on talking twincest with my kid.

3) My son is mature enough to not take to heart sexism or racism in reading. It was more embarrassing to me to realize that something I enjoyed and even recommended was so obviously against my personal feelings as an adult. I appreciate the concern, but this is more my issue than his."

kee9h6,books,Women writing gay men,"I'm a gay guy, just wanted to express frustration with the state of gay fiction, especially romantic gay fiction. There was a post about this a month ago, but bringing it up again.

On the one hand, I'm grateful that many women have written gay fiction that I enjoy. A lot of these works have changed the way I relate to my own sexuality in a very positive way.

On the other hand, I think many women write gay men just as poorly as the stereotype of men writing women poorly, and it's frustrating to read. Sometimes gay men are written as an expression of how some women wish straight men would act. Stereotypically soft, not status driven, not very sexually active, surrounded by supportive and protective women (often self-inserts). The villains are traditionally masculine characters.

There are some dick-brained, stupid ass gay guys out there. There are hyper-masculine gays and stereotypically feminine gays straight out of anime or something. I have personally behaved in stupid and gross ways because of thinking with my penis, just like (some) straight guys. I have also sometimes acted like the gay stereotypes I listed above. But those stereotypes are over-represented specifically in gay fiction written by women.

To give you an example of unrealistic behavior: In one comic I read, when the two love interests were finally ready to have ""their first time"" with each other -- I kid you not, they sat down next to each other and googled ""how to have gay sex,"" clothes on, seemingly uninterested. This is the perfect expression of a sort of calculated, slow-burn sexuality that is rare in gay guys and more common in women. It's definitely there. I personally know some gay guys who maybe wouldn't do *that* but would do things in that ballpark. But it's usually all you see from women writing gay men.

So whatever, maybe that fiction just isn't for me. It's written by women, for women. I think I'm allowed to be annoyed by it, though...

Edit: Just to be clear. Pasting a comment I wrote.

>I’d  even say it’s good to write stereotypically flamboyant gay men. Those  people are real, I know plenty and they probably need more  representation too.  
>  
>These  characters I’m talking about are like... female stereotypes inside of  gay male bodies. Flamboyant gay men are still men. Hard to explain.  These characters lack a sense of maleness even behind our traditional  ideas of masculinity.  
>  
>That’s ok to be in real life, and those people exist and I think they’re interesting. Just over-represented in fiction."

I've read (almost) every Stephen King novel, novella, short story, and non-fiction under his name - I'm missing the *Gwendy* works, the book about the 2004 Red Sox season, and when he puts out a short story as a part of a multi-author anthology.

What I have come across is people voicing their opinion about how ""Classic King"" is better than ""Sober King."" They can't stand works like *Insomnia*, *Cell*, the Bill Hodges Trilogy, etc. I think it would be easier to think of King's career as smaller careers instead of one big omnibus, which has been done for other artists, usually musicians.

For example, Aerosmith had a successful career in the '70s - early '80s, and had a separate career starting with their RUN-DMC collaboration remaking ""Walk This Way."" AC/DC is broken up into the Bon Scott and Brian Johnson eras by fans. Most of this is done so that fans of the artist can explain what they enjoy more to other fans or newcomers.

Era I - *Carrie* (1974) to *The Dark Half* (1989) - What is largely considered ""Classic"" King, including his releases as Richard Bachman. King was drinking and drugging *hard* through this era. In *On Writing*, he admits that he doesn't remember writing *Cujo*. This is when King was the ""King of Horror"" that marketing professionals the world over will never let us forget.

Era II - *Needful Things* (1991) to *The Dark Tower* (2004) - This is when almost everything King wrote was pulled into The Dark Tower. This is where I think King's least-appreciated works lie. My favourite King novel is *Dolores Claiborne*. There are some stumbles here, too. *Dreamcatcher* doesn't need to be talked about and *Rose Madder*'s antagonist is so one-dimensional that [DoodleBob](https://spongebob.fandom.com/wiki/DoodleBob) could do it better. What is lacking here is King's quality output regarding novellas and short stories. What he put out isn't bad in this time but the limitations and focus on novels hampered his creativity, in my opinion. 

Era III - *The Colorado Kid* (2005) to present - After finishing *The Dark Tower*, King had some shaky recovery work (*Cell* isn't his best effort). When the releases began to truly satiate King fans is debatable. For me, *Just After Sunset* and *Full Dark, No Stars* should be thanked for reminding him to exercise all of his creative muscles instead of focusing solely on one set. 

If you've made it this far, thank you for indulging me. I'm curious if you agree with the eras as I've defined them, and what your favourite book/short story collection from each era would be. Or, if you entirely disagree with the concept, I'd like to hear about that, too."

I don't want to have any negative ideas about women, as I believe that all people are equal, but how else would I have missed that part of his story telling? So I'm hoping that I can get some examples from the stories related to women and how poorly GRRM treats them, and I'd love it even more if I could also get an analysis of why the scene in question is problematic. But that may be asking a bit too much. Either way I love reading ideas and I really hope someone or someones can respond to this so I can learn and perhaps better myself a bit. Thank you for your time."
lwfmp4,books,I have a VERY specific favorite genre. What about you?,"I'm not sure if you could really call this a genre, maybe just a type of book. But anyway -- I love fishing horror.

I know that sounds weird. But I find nothing more genuinely creepy than a horror book/movie/game that is involves fishing. 

My favorite book that fits in this category is, of course, The Fisherman by John Langan. 

I like lots of other kinds of books too but there's something about aquatic and specifically fishing horror that just really does it for me, y'know? So my question to you guys is this: do you have a really specific, niche kind of story or theme that you love?

Edit: if you have any good scary fishing books/stories please send them my way

Edit two: wow, thanks for all the replies, youbguys! I can't respond to all of them but I will read each and every one, and they all make me smile! :)"
gwqzsw,books,"Reading has allowed me to become more open minded and empathetic, do you guys feel the same?","When I began reading I used to only look at novels where the author is a man in his teens/twenties (such as myself). I was able to relate to the narrator quite easily and enjoyed seeing the parallels between his life and my life.

&#x200B;

However, I recently picked up a copy of Sense and Sensibility, and boy am I having a blast with it. It's really fun to look at life through the lens of people belonging to different eras, cultures, and obviously, taking a look at female perspectives on life.

&#x200B;

I know this seems obvious to some of you, but as someone who really hasn't stepped outside of my 'bubble' before it's really exciting and I've felt a shift more towards open mindedness and empathy."

afbpy1,books,"Does anyone understand those ""movie in your head"" readers? Are you one? Did you become one?","It's always rather mind-boggling to me whenever someone tries to sell me on why they love reading so much on this idea. I've never felt like there was some movie playing internally while I had all the description of novels to take in, there's no sound, no vision.

Usually when I'm reading books it feels more like a stand-in for a storyteller (that's what it is, ultimately), with my reactions mirroring how I would respond to an actual person telling me about what's happened. Taking ""show don't tell"" and telling it right back. All like:

>Book: ""Still, it was difficult to recognize her original features beneath the reddish scabs and sparse hair. The skeleton of her body made a distinct impression through the thin blue hospital sheet. Even in her condition, she could not keep from flirting.""

>Me: *""Woah, what happened? She got diseased? This terminal?""*

>Book: ""Only her voice had not changed. It was difficult to know if she was teasing or not. *""And I thought you were coming back to me. You will marry her, won't you? Of course, I will try to forgive you because I know you loved me first.""*

>Me: *""That's a real possessive attitude right there. Not that I can blame her, you told me she doesn't have anyone else in her life, and now what? You telling me she's practically on her deathbed after a life about having things done to her rather than one about what she could do? Goddamned reality checks.""*

Audiovisual mediums in contrast feel like they give me some kind of first hand experience of being a witness of the events, which tends to be supported further by how they tend to lack things like a convenient narration to inform me what's going on. I thought that was kind of like, the point. What is the point of having invented movies if we've got 'em playing right in our brains seeing text? I thought it was the other way around: pictures' worth a thousand words.

Is my imagination just straight up stunted? Did you use to be like me, but developed this ability over time? Maybe I just need to read a more artfully written book..."

gickne,books,"Last night I, someone who’s watched LOTR countless times, finished reading the trilogy for the first time. Here are my side-by-side thoughts:","**Brief Background**: My brother introduced me to the movies at 11. In the past 18 years I can’t tell you how many times I’ve seen them all. My best friend used to have LOTR Sundays during college and play them in the background while we studied (she could always maintain studying, I never did). I’ve seen these movies an absurd amount of times.

**My Comparative Thoughts**

- Tolkien’s a true storyteller. So much so that he makes his characters natural storytellers, too. This at times fell a bit flat when characters told their experiences to other characters instead of us seeing them live. It felt very against the “show don’t tell rule” of good writing. It made me appreciate how the movie captured those scenes fully. But honestly, by the end I really found appreciation for this stylistic choice.
- With the movies, I tend to prefer the Aragorn/Legolas/Gimli scenes, but in the books I found a lot more interest in the Frodo and Sam parts. Book 4 just may be my favorite overall. Definitely the one I read the fastest. **Edit**: Lord of the Rings is technically three volumes (FotR, TT, RotK) separated into 6 books, 2 books per volume. So the 4th book of LOTR solely focuses on Frodo, Sam, and Gollum’s travels up to Shelob.
- A bit specific, but Denethor’s death is **significantly better** than in the movies. The movie version seems so hokey now whereas the book truly captured his devolving to madness. Don’t think I’ll ever watch it the same. **Edit to specify**: Denethor’s running through Minas Tirith on fire vs him clinging to the palantír on the pyre is what makes it pretty cheesy for me. The latter is chilling and a better way to close his character’s arc.
- Last night I was prepared for the last 80 pages to drag, but I flew through them. There have been many times watching the trilogy where I’ll opt out after Aragorn’s crowning ceremony because it’s just a slow fizzle out, but the wrapping up in the book was so pleasant, intriguing, attentive and gave me the best sense of closure. I was gushing by the time I closed the book because I sincerely loved the way Tolkien brought the fellowship’s story to a close. 
- **Edit** because I keep getting screamed at about it: Tom Bombadil is certainly a cool character. He’s whimsical, thoughtful, truly loves his wife (aw), got songs4days, and he’s subtly (to be read in an Always Sunny Mac voice) *badass*. To be the only character (even including Sam) to casually throw on the ring and be like “Oh this ol’ thing?” and throw it back to Frodo is fuckin cool, man. **But** I really have no problem with him not being in the movies. If they threw him in for 5 minutes pre-Bree it wouldn’t have been justified enough. If they gave him a proper 15-20 minute scene, it would’ve taken the *Fellowship* overboard. That’s it y’all. That’s just me.

**Potentially Embarrassing Confessions**
- The number of times a non-movie character was spoken of and I thought, “ehh that’s probably the name of one of their horses” was too many.🤦‍♀️
- Why did I *always* think Théoden was Eowyn and Eomer’s dad?! I’m sure the movie acknowledges he’s their uncle, but I’ve overlooked that many, many times.

**Dumb Side Note**
- I can no longer read Lothlórien without singing it to the tune of the Pixies “Velouria.” 🎵My Loth-ló-rien. My Loth-ló-rien🎵"
jicl1z,books,Do you ever get tired of the story trope where the protagonist is considered an outcast but their traits of what makes them outcasts also subsequently make them special and change the world?,"I see this a lot in young adult novels and I can understand the reasoning behind this theme - young adults learning to grow and learn more about themselves and realise that they are different than what they might appear, and/or perceive themselves as different from their peers.

Then they realise that they are different or unique in some way and fear that this makes them feel ostracised or unable to fit in.

&#x200B;

Even I experienced this when I was young and I still struggle with this and I am sure that many people still struggle to find acceptance amongst others or amongst themselves, whether child or adult.

However, in reality, I feel that this is also damaging and quite cliche that it makes the whole idea of change and embracing uniqueness meaningless.

I get that this trope is meant to make the reader feel empowered and embrace and become wowed by the world that is around them but I feel that sometimes comes across as shallow or not geniune or authentic.

&#x200B;

I like this idea of embracing uniqueness in some way because even I struggle to accept myself as who I am, warts and all.

I do not consider myself to be different from others or the outcast but I do have qualities that makes me unique or identifiable from those around me.

And even when I was growing up, I realised this even though I also had trouble to understand it or embrace it.

But as I grew older, as much as I have learned to embrace my individuality, I realised that these individual traits do not make me special or incredibly unique.

Yes, I know that many parts of human society provoke me and everyone else to follow the status quo because of peer pressure or follow some form of group think or taboo and every one of us experiences this in some shape or form.

But in many aspects, these are things that make me human and the things that make us want to fit in.

And ironically, once you fit in with someone else who also identify as ""different"" or ""unique"", you realise that you are not so unique or different after all - you are just a mixture of many traits just like everyone else and you might fit in or become accepted in mulitple different groups.

&#x200B;

Yes, there are things in human psychology and/or human society that are either unhealthy or need to be updated but it is not that simple as flipping a switch and make a change. In reality, either these things have a purpose or are so integrated in how human beings function that it is difficult to replace them.

&#x200B;

I think that most of these subliminal messages about change, revolution, individuality and noticing the stuff that is happening underneath are either empty messages, or are not as impactful as they are meant to be, or are mostly empty marketing to exploit people's insecurities or desires to make an impact.

If you do not give people the right message about the positives and also the consequences, repurucssions and complications about change, uniqueness and revolution, then you are giving an ironic message about the whole idea behind the message and it is basically the same message as everything else - a message of little substance that has a lot of things happening underneath that are meant to provoke a certain group of people to behave in a certain expected way

&#x200B;

This is not a means to attack any kind of movement or an advocacy to represent change. It is just a means of saying that if a story wants to advocate this type of message, it should be made in a way that is both impactful and human."

laqc6l,books,Do you also have to recover from a book before starting a new book or am I just weird?,"When I finish a really good book, I will 'quit' reading for a while. My brain is like:""Hey buddy, let's not start the next one now. Let's wait a little.""

I feel like I have to recover. So many things go trough my mind about that book that if I would start another one, I just wouldn't be interested in it at all.

The better the book, the longer it takes to recover. My longest 'recovery' has taken months. But most were about a week or two. The one that took months was so intense. I felt like would never experience such a book again.

A few books that gave me that experience:

>Name Of The Wind (Patrick Rothfuss)

>Animal Farm (George Orwell)

>Maus (Art Spiegelman)

>Surely You're Joking, Mr Feynman! (Richard. P. Feynman)


Do you have it too or am I just weird?

Also what books gave you this experience?

Edit:
It is called a Book Hangover!

There seem to be 3 kinds of people:

The first one experiences it like me. When a book is really good, they need some time!

The second one never has these experiences and always starts a new book right after the previous one. Even if it was their favorite ever.

The last one and pretty rare one reads a book and tries everything in their power to get that experience."
dqr1m7,books,Books you thought were amazing...until you tried reading them again.,"One upon a time I picked up a book in W H Smiths and read the blurb on the back.  It sounded sort of interesting, but maybe not enough to totally grab me.  I was about to put it back when a fellow next to me said something like, “That’s an amazing series.  I can’t wait until enough time has gone by that I’ve forgotten about it enough to read it again.”  He kinda sold me on it right there and then.  I picked it back up and they rung it up at the till.  The book was Lord Foul’s Bane, the first book in the Thomas Covenant fantasy series.  I read it, I loved it, and devoured the next five books.

By the end of it I felt like that guy who had, once upon a time, told me he couldn’t wait until enough time had gone by so that he could read them again fresh.  I waited years.  Then...holy shit...news came out that Stephen Donaldson was writing a final four book series!  Holy shit!  I can wait until they’re all written, right?  Wait, and then read all ten glorious books one after the other.

Ten years later I feel like I’m finally ready to finally dive back into this glorious world that scored a lightning strike through my adolescence.  What a beautiful, nostalgic return to a long-treasured memory-world.  Only what I come back to after a life lived, books read, is a messy pudding of 2D characters (excepting Covenant, I suppose), and so-so world-building. 

Dammit, it’s good.  I remember it being so good.  I plough through Lord Foul’s Bane and The Illearth War.  But halfway through The Power That Preserves I just can’t go on.  Those golden memories have been tainted by going back.  Damn.  If only I had left it where it was.

Have you ever gone back to a beautifully remembered book, and found that the transit of time has ruined it for you completely?"

Here's a recording, should anybody be interested (the reading starts about at around 8:30 in): http://mixlr.com/happy-tentacle-radio/showreel/the-stories-we-share-the-little-prince/

Let me preface this post by apologizing if it breaks any rules in this sub. I did read them, but I feel this post is in a grey area. It goes without saying, I understand if you delete the post if I trespass on the rules. I would appreciate a recommendation to a suitable subreddit if that is the case.

That out of the way. As the title says, I feel the age old tradition of reading to each other has faded away, and I think it's a tragedy. There is something about having someone read or tell you a story. There is this magical combination of the way the story is told, shaped by the tone and tempo if the voice, and your own imagination. The magic is that something happens that would not have occurred if you ""simply"" read the story yourself. It comes to life in another way, and for many it's less straining on your concentration. Others don't like to read by themselves.

Audio books are a great way to get a similar experience, but to me they lack the feeling that the book is read, in this moment, to you. You miss the facial expressions of the reader, or the gestures that underline certain points.

I personally read very often to my family. Whether that be a night time story for the kids or something more fitting for my wife after we've gone to bed. It's a kind of quality time I wouldn't miss for the world.

Besides storytelling, another big passion of mine - that used to be me my professional occupation - is music. I love finding new and obscure music and especially - sharing it with others. 

I've combined those two passions in a hobby of mine, where I do live recordings from passages of books, poems and such, while I at the same time mix music that matches the mood and the progression of the stories I read. It's a hobby that consumes a lot of time, because I insist on doing it all live. I literally put days into the preparation... And I've been told it shows. 

I realize it's dreadfully presumptuous of me to assume any of you might be interested, but the whole sharing part is one of the main pillars that drives this hobby. Which is why I invite anyone interested to join me, and my regular listeners this Sunday at 21:00 CET (15:00 ET I believe) for a live reading of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry's ""The Little Prince"".

This book is to me something of a miracle of a short book. The layers of meaning and the depths of its wisdom make it a book you cannot read or be read to too many times. There's always something new to learn.

Let me underline this is hobby-based. There is **no** profit-making, advertisements or the like involved. Nothing. I'm just some dude who loves books, storytelling and music, who'd like to share that love with other people.

So the oblig links are as follows:

Thanks for reading. I hope I get a chance to read for you in turn.

Edit: I'm a bit overwhelmed with all the heart warming, fun and super interesting messages people have posted here. I've tried to answer as many as I can, but it's Friday night, the kids are in bed, and I'm going to spend some quality time with the wife. I'll come back tomorrow.

jyvh8v,books,I've Completed my 2020 Reading Challenge of reading 20 books!,"Hi, everyone.

During Covid break, I wanted some new hobby. So I started to read but I was less interested in ebooks. So at the end of May (on my 31st birthday) I purchased few books & started a reading challenge in goodreads. Today I completed the challenge.

[Books I've Read:](https://i.imgur.com/VMVoMPA.png)

* I started with **The Godfather** bcoz it was my favorite movie, It was beautifully written by Mario Puzo, I only read it before bed & finished it in 6 days. Really wanted more sequels.
* Next, it was Classic Sci-Fi **Dune**, I'm a big fan of Sci-Fi everyone recommended Dune, it started of bit slowly & then I was blown over, what a great story, A Jihad in Space! (I will reread it later before the sequels)
* **1984**: I had already watched the movie but reading the novel made me depressed, I never enjoyed it.
* **The Martian**: I've watched the movie, but Novel was better than the movie & never had a dull moment, I would probably read it again.
* **The Girl with a Dragon Tattoo**: I've watched the Millennium Trilogy, Extended Mini TV series, American remake, still the novel was good, one of the best thriller.
* **The Hobbits**: I've watched the Trilogy, the studio had milked it for greed & ruined the whole story with unnecessary love interest & I liked the novel it was better.
* **The Lord of Rings**: The Classic Fantasy, Tolkien is the god of Fantasy novels, there are no words to explain it.
* **Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind** is a ambitious book by Yuval Noah Harari, I had never read an non-fiction or historic book, but after reading this book I want to explore them.
   * I read Homo Deus, but it was OK but not ground breaking like Sapiens.
* **Stories of your Life and Others**: **Ted Chiang** is a Genius, I had already read the Stories of your Life short story epub after watching The Arrival it was great. Tower of Babylon, Seventy-Two Letters were also great & Understand was my favorite.
   * I've read **Exhalation: Stories** also, I really can't stop praising Ted Chiang, particularly The Merchant and the Alchemist's Gate was so good, I want more, probably a full fledged novel in that universe. Even Exhalation & Anxiety is the Dizziness of Freedom were great stories.
* **I, Robot**: A classic novel with lot of good short stories. I really like Issac Asimov's robot universe, so I had ordered rest of the books from Robot & Foundation Series.
   * I've read **Caves of Steel**, **Naked Sun** & **Robots of Dawn**, they are lit bit slow but worth it, I liked the ending of Robots of Dawn finished it today.
* **2001: A Space Odyssey**: A great novel, probably the best Sci-Fi novel & movie, when i first watched the movie, I knew Kubrick was a Maverick Genius, probably one of the greatest minds in movie industry. Finally after reading the novel, now I can say that I understand 2001: A Space Odyssey. I'll reread it again before the sequels.
* **Station Eleven**: A Post-Apocalyptic novel by Emily St. John Mandel, I was probably bit disappointing with the ending, I was waiting for a final standoff or something, even though I had guessed who The Prophet was, still a good novel. My favorite thing was how the story-lines were connected to Arthur.
* **The Road**: A Post-Apocalyptic masterpiece by Cormac McCarthy. It is one of saddest, most bleakest novel, I had watched the movie but reading the novel gave me chills!
   * Cormac McCarthy writing is beautiful, this paragraph briefly explains the state of post-apocalyptic world:

>At the farther edge of the town they came upon a solitary house in field and they crossed end entered and walked through the rooms. They came upon themselves in a mirror and he almost raised the pistol. It's us, Papa, the boy whispered. It's us.

I have watched lot of movies & tv series but nowadays I'm bit bored, the quality of stories have dwindled, now its quantity comes first compared to quality, there are 100 of TV shows every year & movies are ruined by sequels, prequels, remakes & reboots.

So reading books have given me a joy, something to look forward when i reach home apart from watching Football.

After following these subreddits: r/books, r/booksuggestions, r/printSF \- I've added lot of books to my read-list & spent a lot on books, have many in my cupboard, now i need to spend on a bookshelf.

If you have any recommendation, please tell me.
Sorry if my English is bad.
Thank you.

**Edit: Thank you for your kind replies, I'll try to reply to everyone.**

And I've heard lot of good things about Brandon Sanderson, most of you recommended it. I'll start Cosmere Universe (I've been collecting them already) but first I've to read Foundation Series, later I'll start Cosmere Universe.

**Edit: I can't believe so many of you replied & suggested lot of great books, thank you very much.**

Finally I've 561 books in to-read-list, and I own 52 book now, so my next goal for 2021 will be 40 Books.

Again, Thank you!"

The whale scene really sealed the deal for me...excellent novel!"
750i5b,books,"I finally read ""The Lord of the rings"" books, and they were better than I've ever expected.","Warning: spoilers 

Four year ago when I was in high school I bought and read ""the hobbit"". It was a well written book that got me really into the story and excited to read LOTR. So I read the hobbit again, but unfortunately I couldn't get myself to start with LOTR, partly because I bough all three books in one and it looked intimidating to finish, and partly because I started with university and I didn't have much time on my hands till beginning of this summer. 

I start with the fellowship beginning of July and it just hits me hard with nostalgia of the hobbit. Tolkien's style of writing didn't feel tedious like many other stories I've read. He paints a picture and explains in a way that I would've never thought I'm capable of imagining. 

Today I just finished ""The return of the king"" and it's bitter sweet end to me. I feel attached to the books after 3 months of reading and sad that I know I won't wake up to a chapter of the book with my morning coffee. But at the same time I'm happy that I got to read all of it finally and it was such a journey that I've never expected and I recommend the books to anyone and everyone.

But I have one thing that is confusing me, that is the time of the journey (to mount doom and back). At the beginning of the book Bilbo is celebrating his 111th birthday, and a year after that Frodo leaves the shire, when Bilbo is 112. Now after they come back from mount doom, gandalf sits with Frodo and tells him that although it might feel long ago that he started out of the shire, it's only less than a year since then. And that timeline was mentioned I think a few times after. But when they are on their way back to rivendell and celebrate Bilbo's birthday, he is turning 129. That means he grew 17 years older in this one year. Am I missing something here ? What's going on ? 

I would love to hear from other people who've read the books :)"

I'll get this odd void/melancholy mood for a day or two afterward too, but I know it's a good book when it happens though, because it really feels like I've been through something with the characters even though that's strange and illogical since well... y'know, they're just words on a page. 
Anyone relate or am I just nuts? :p

The standard version of The Epic of Gilgamesh is estimated to have been sketched onto Babylonian tablets around 4 millennia ago; yet the themes of this tale of life, death, and friendship are still deeply relevant and effective to the modern reader.

The Epic does suffer from repeative dialogue (which I imagine flowed better in the original poetic verse: and was designed so the epic could be more easily told and remembered), and very occasionally reads like a cheesy, yet weirdly violent, Saturday Morning Cartoon (notably, the battle with the Bull of Heaven); yet at others times, is exceptional, which its core pathos of living without fear of death being beautifully told."

As I read I was fully immersed within the galaxy Asimov crafts, and was delighted to find similarities to current sci-fi universes such as 40k. I came away thinking it was a wonderful book, and while searching for more information on other books in the series I was amazed to discover that it's original year of publication was 1942. I cannot imagine what it must have been like to read Foundation in the middle of the second world war. If you haven't taken the time to read Foundation, I fully recommend it, the scale, the politics, the intrigue, is all breathtaking."

gkw6y2,books,Just read The Giving Tree by Shel Silverstein to my 5yo son and I'm crying harder than I have since my divorce.,"It's amazing how much emotion you can fit into such a simple narrative. Silverstein does this by alluding to the constant and sometimes fruitless search for happiness throughout life. But, is this also a story about unhealthy relationships? Is he trying to warn us about giving too much to someone who never reciprocates? What other life lessons can you see in it?

Edit: Thanks for all of the deep insights! It seems like everyone is torn between discussing the deep respect they had for the person in their life who gave even when it was hard, and discussing how much they dislike the boy for taking with no gratitude! While both lessons can and should be gleaned from the story, I think Silverstein would like us to focus on the former, as he named it ""the giving tree"" and not ""the selfish boy"" :)

Edit 2: I think the tree, in the end, was truly happy. When the boy came back the last time, the tree said ""I don't have anything to give you,"" and the boy essentially said ""you are enough,"" as he sat down on the stump to rest. Which, in the end, would make all of those sacrifices worth it."
4mmju3,books,I just finished It by Stephen King for the first time so headed on down to my local drains to paint this.,"So i've read Stephen King since I was young, loving his words and ideas and everything in between, but for reasons beyond me, never picked up It. Perhaps I thought it was too scary, perhaps I was intimidated by the length. Who really knows. That was until a few months back, and am glad for it.

I began planning this artwork after just reading the first chapter, it was that vivid, but ended up losing my sketch and just freestyling it on the wall. It wasn't until afterwards that I remembered my grand plans of a giant spider shadow behind Pennywise and the little parrafin coated boat in his other hand.

**Edit: I want to share some of my favorite thoughts from this novel, after having a couple days to reflect on it and discuss it with some of you lovely people. Also, I'm going to list some of the book recommendations I've gotten in this thread! While there are probably 30-40 recommendations, I'll list the ones that 2+ users have recommended, that way no one has to scroll for recommendations!**


**A few thoughts a few days after finishing the book:** 

* Timshel: Never had heard this word before reading EOE. This idea that we can ultimately choose who we want to be. We all have bad and good in us, but we have ultimate say in which is showcased through our words and actions. **Second Edit:** [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8D7MLsNAb8) *Timshel*, by Mumford and Sons. Thanks for several of you who pointed it out to me! Mumford and Sons wrote it about the book. 

* Favorite character: Tie between Sam Hamilton and Cathy. Sam because I felt like I *knew* him, and he didn't even have that much dialogue. He was such an incredible man full of spirit and integrity, although flawed of course. Cathy because I could see some of myself in her. She represents the evil that all of us have somewhere in us. While the other characters (Charles or Cal for example) are able to overcome this evil and choose to be good, Cathy cannot. This is why she cannot understand other characters and other characters cannot understand her. She completely lacks empathy and at times comes off as inhumane. Every scene with her completely captivated me. 

* Sibling rivalry: This one hit home with me because I have siblings close in age to me. A lot of the conversations, fights, jealousy, and love reminded my of both good and bad times growing up. 

* I love thinking about the concept of wealth when thinking of this book, and Steinbeck isn't shy about bringing it up. Who's really happier? The poor hardworking family or the richer characters? I've thought about money/wealth personally a lot before and this just confirms what I already believe: money doesn't buy happiness. 

* If you're gonna write a book spanning multiple generations, you're gonna have to write about death. Steinbeck does this so well. Yes, some of the deaths are dramatic (poisoned or suicide) but most of the deaths are from disease! Diseases that now, wouldn't pose much of a problem in America ravaged families because medicine was nothing compared to today. Characters died of stroke, appendicitis....etc. 

* If you like character development and trying to critically analyze the motivations/actions of characters, you will love this book. I found myself constantly trying to guess what characters were up to and why they might be this way. I'm someone who tries to do this in real life with people, it's just fascinating to me and Steinbeck gives you many opportunities to do this in EOE. 

* People keep commenting asking what this book is about. I don't really have a clear answer. It's not really about *anything*. It's just a few generations of farmers living in California struggling to make meaning out of their lives, battle their demons, and find love and happiness.

How this even classifies as a children’s novel I don’t know.  The themes of religion, love, sex, power, and death are discussed in thematic and blunt detail. Phillip Pullman really has created a masterpiece I think it’s a series every child should read. It’s eye opening and makes you think. Can you think of other examples of children’s books that tackle such adult themes? "
cyocxt,books,"Currently reading Dune, my first truly fictional novel... that requires my complete imagination. Its like I'm hacking into an unexplored part of my brain","I am 27 years old and have read 28 books in my entire life (8 in the last 5 months). Dune is the 9th, although this book is the trilogy, but I'm counting it as one as its just in a single edition.

The type of books I usually read are non-fiction and memoirs, that read like a novel. Shantaram, The Snow Leopard and Dreams From My Father absolutely stood out to me and changed my perspective in life. As I have started to enjoy reading this year and it has become a bit of a habit (thanks to this sub), I thought I would delve into fiction. 

From the few books I have read, some were fiction, but these I have picked up after watching films made from them. Such as John Grisham novels and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. So I had a complete world already built in my head and faces for characters before I even read the first page.

Dune, on the other hand, is such a tough read for me as I have no clue how the world is or even a vague idea of the story. I haven't seen the old film, and didn't really plan to. Decided I would give this a read as I'm a huge Denis Villanueve fan and heard he's making a movie based on part of the book. I'm a slow reader usually, take about 2 minutes per page for the books I've read so far. But I find myself taking 4 minutes to read one page as Im not used to reading a book with new jargon and simultaneously building a world in my head. Basically, if I read for 2 hours a day I would only complete 30 pages. 

I can understand now when people say reading a book improves your imagination, especially if it's a book with a story and a world built so strongly like Dune (Harry Potter would be too I guess, but I have already seen the movies, so wouldn't require much imagination on my part). This might seem like an obvious post, but I am just fascinated by this. I'm starting to think books require much more of a proactive approach for your brain and movies are reactive. Basically, movies based on books are just for people too lazy, who tend to give the excuse they are too busy. Yeah, Netflix can wait, I have booked a trip to Arrakis."
7c1575,books,"Asimov's ""The Last Question""","I really love this story. I was thinking about how interested I would be in discussing it, with people who have also read it. It's very short! Just nine pages. With a great ending.

7yknrf,books,The Art of War by Sun Tsu is more about life than it is about War.,"I have read the book twice, and studied a bit in depth of what each of the tatics he used in battle. After reading about the nine types of grounds, i have come to the realization that his book was never really about war against the enemy, but war against ourselves. Every war we fight, is a war inflicted against us. Everyday is a new battle, and how we aproach the battle determines our ability to handle the problems we face everyday. 


The nine types of grounds is in essence, how we analyze a problem. Some problems have irreversible effects (constricted ground), like divorce. Some problems can benefit both sides, (contentious ground) like a deal. Some issues tread deep into enemy territory, like hatred between 2 rivals, and some problems can even be within you (dispersing ground) like depression.


The book teaches that we can utilize a multistage strike to solve a complex problem, kind of like a snake. If you attack the head, the snake strikes with its tail, and if you attack its tail, it strikes with its head. If you attack the body, it strikes with both the head and the tail. This essentially means that a person must set up boundaries, and if theyre breached to the core, you must strike with both the head and the tail. You must avoid deals that are too good to be true. You mustnt fall to the extreme advice of others, as this is a weakness of your ability to control your life.


The book also shows how to attack with fire. This is the same as explaining how a person should aproach new technologies in life, or new methods of solving an issue. Every new technology like iphones or the introduction of a new method to solve math problems (common core method) comes with its benifits and doubts. Of course, a lot of people will complain how useless math is in common core or how dumb the new iphonex must be, but thats because they failed to utlize its strengths and only look to its fault. So is fire. It burns and leaves irreversible wounds. But it is also warming in a cold night and can set an army fleeing from their now burned camps. The matter is utilization.


The book talks about endurance. How an army must march, and how you must deal with logistics. You are not allowed to overlook any one variable of your life, or it spells disasters. This means dont sacrifice sleep, or procastinate. It also means you cannot participate in activities that only temporarily solve your issues (superstious omen takings). Often the best way to face your issue is to put yourself in a position where you cannot escape, for this will only bring out the best of you, as this version of you is a reflection of your true character. 


So there you have it. Its not much, and most likely you guys already know this. But the Art of War is a book about life, and how to handle issues in it using both the convential and unconvential to solve problems and adapt to the circumstances of life."

jfm2eu,books,I Completed my 2020 Goal of Reading 100 Books in a Year!,"I did it, guys!  Ah, I'm so happy.  This was something I've been building up towards for a while.

I was a voracious reader when I was little, to the point where my parents had to physically remove all of my books out of my room once because I wouldn't stop reading after bedtime.  Through high school and college, I dropped off of reading hard-core, and actually only picked it back up a few years ago.

I'm 26 now. Last year I gave myself a goal of 50 books in a year (not believing I would make it that far tbh, but I wanted enough room that I wouldn't reach that goal super quickly) (Don't worry, that reason didn't make sense to current-me either).  Unfortunately I truly can't remember if I completed that goal.  So this year, I wanted to push myself and learn to fall in love with books again.

[**Link to my Book List**](https://imgur.com/a/qMKlRHD)  
(Sorry it's hand-written, I never kept track on my laptop because...yeah, I have no good answer.)

The first few books were ROUGH.  It took me forever to get through *Waiting, Empire of Blue Water,* and *Leonardo Da Vinci* because I felt like I was exercising a muscle I hadn't used in ages. I read mostly at work when I was on break, and then would go home and read a few pages more before dumping it and playing through my 40th Skyrim run for 3 hours.  Reading felt like a chore, like I could be doing something way better and cooler than this.  But once I started getting into the habit of reading and making myself set aside time for it, I started reading faster and for longer stints of time.  

Reading 100 books became way easier than expected thanks to a tiny little thing called the rona, along with me being out of work for about 5 months.  So a lot of my summer days were spent out on my front porch devouring book after book and forgetting sunscreen constantly.  I read at night and earned my fair share of mosquito bites for my troubles.  I read on the floor and the couch and the bed and learned what back problems were.  I read in the bath (only dropped one book in the tub, whoof.) Reading became my favorite way to decompress after doomscrolling through Twitter and Reddit or after a day of hoping I still had a job after all of this.  

And even after I went back to work in July (finally) (from home of course) (thanks, rona) I kept up reading.  I read faster than I had in the beginning, but I also felt that I took in more information and let it simmer in my brain as well.  Reading wasn't a chore at this point, it was something I truly loved and looked forward to every day.  Bookstores became my best friend again.  I was ordering books upon books online and there was a point where I was getting a package every day with 2-5 new books tucked inside. I built my mini-library up to the point I needed a whole new bookshelf. I felt like an addict.  It's amazing.

I finished my 100th book today on my lunch break, one called *House of Leaves.* (It's Spoopy Season, I had to read something super spoopy.)  While I'm absolutely gonna dive back into it for all of its little secrets, I can't help but feel a huge sense of pride and accomplishment right now.

**What did I learn?**

\-I learned that my favorite genres to read are absolutely fantasy and Star Trek (Yes, Star Trek counts as a genre, do not fight me and my million 1980s Pocket Books on this).    
\-I like the feel of a real book in my hands rather than an ebook.    
\-You should only take books you don't really care about into the bath with you.   
\-If you're gonna read 100 books, keep switching them up.  Read mind-bending classics and giant door-stoppers, sure! But intersperse them with light-hearted easy stuff too.   Keeps your brain and your soul fresh and bouncy.  
\-Read what you love, and love what you read. I love D&D comic books.  I love old children's Royal Diaries books. I love crappy Star Trek novels. 

\-Reading is like anything, take breaks from it.  I still got in a good 300 more hours of Skyrim over this summer.  

\-It's not about reading fast, it's about making sure you're taking in what you're reading.  Some books I read in a day, some books took me upwards of 2 weeks.  

\-Don't buy waaaay too many bookmarks because all of a sudden you'll look at your life and choices and realize you're reading 8 books at once.  Bookmarks allow this to happen. They're the true secret menace.

\-*Star Trek: The Motion Picture: Pop-Up Book* is a real book and I will have no arguments.

For the last 3 years have read books mainly in english, because my language lacks in translations to a lot of books i wanted to read. But never before have i read so many pages in english and in such a short period of time! Im actually quite amazed at how much i read lol

Its obvious to me that the amount of pages you can read in a day is also set by how flowing the writing of the book is, which is probably what mainly contributed to the amount of pages i read. But even so, im proud of it.

What was a time in which you read so many pages that you ended the day with ""Phew, that was intense?"" And how many people read in a language which isnt their native one?"

But because of that it happens sometimes to me that I buy a book where I sooner or later lose track of all the characters, the crazy vocabulary or the story in general and, at some point, decide to better read another book instead (when it just doesn't seem to make any sense anymore).

When I was about 15 years old for example I tried to read *The Satanic Verses* by **Salman Rushdie**, but since I had almost no knowledge of the necessary context back then I just couldn't follow the story at all, at which point I then decided to try it again another time when I'm older.
Another two examples are *Mason & Dixon* by **Thomas Pynchon** and *Ada or Ardor* by **Vladimir Nabokov** who are both written in such an extraordinary sophisticated writing style that I simply lost track at some point and decided to give up and maybe try again when I'm older (I'm now 22 by the way and didn't try it again yet), although I really enjoyed what I understood so far.

I'm an English teacher and always looking for books that I can use in class. This means that I frequently read children's books and YA novels. These books are some of the most well written books one can find. As an adult I have thoroughly enjoyed them.

It doesn't matter if a book isn't targeted at you. You should never feel ashamed for what you enjoy reading, whether it's classic literature, kid's books, fanfiction or graphic novels. Every form of reading is valid. And frankly as a teacher I'm happy people are reading anyway.

Don't be scared to pick up a book that looks nice because of what people might say. Read it and enjoy it, that's what reading is all about. Enjoyment. Don't ever let anyone take that from you.

Well, with the help of a few Redditors, I’ve typed up the list so anyone can see and use it.

&nbsp;

Along with the title and author, the list includes the number of pages, country of origin, and genre. The list is not going to be perfect, so if you notice any errors please comment or DM me.

At the moment, the list lives in a Google Spreadsheet, but let me know if anyone has any good ideas on where to host it in a more permanent place.

My name's Sam Garland - but you may know me better as /u/Poem_for_your_sprog, author of over 650 spontaneous rhymes on reddit (and another 150 or so via personal message).

Over the last three years, I've had the wonderful luck to write for all sorts of people, and for many, many different occasions. It's been a massive amount of fun, and the support and encouragement I've received has been absolutely overwhelming.

Recently, I had the very exciting pleasure of announcing my first published mini-collection - a selection of 10 fully-illustrated, child-friendly, never-before-seen-in-reddit-comments rhymes, spanning 30 pages! It's available as a printed book and kindle-edition on Amazon - all of the rhymes have been illustrated by the very talented Dan Long of eqcomics.

Okay reddit - *AMA!*

Edit: 5 hours later... thank you all for the fantastic responses and questions. I've had so much fun doing this, and it was long overdue! Thank you also to everyone who's looked into the new collection - I hope you enjoy it!

Lastly - a *huge* thank you to the mods of /r/books, who are the most supportive and friendly team of people you might ever hope to meet. I'm genuinely grateful for all their help and generosity.

For more original rhymes and collaborations, you can also follow me on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Poem_for_your_sprog/419655941507118) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Poem4your_sprog).

a3d6hh,books,"I just finished The Lord of the Rings, I loved it. Now I feel hollow.","It was my bucket list goal to finally read the Lord of the Rings before turning 30 and I finished with a few weeks to spare. I originally tried to read it back when the Fellowship movie came out but couldn't get into it (I think I was 11 at the time).

&#x200B;

I'm not going to gush over how good it was, because it was sincerely amazing and unlike anything else I've ever read. 

&#x200B;

I will say that the ending really, really resonates with me right now. I'm at a point in my life where friendships drift apart naturally, people just need to go their separate ways and have their own lives to deal with. I have a few friends I've drifted from that I still consider very close friends, when we get together it's like no time has passed at all. But I felt what Sam felt as he rode away from Frodo with Merry and Pippin, that bittersweet glad it happened but sad it's over feeling. Much like Sam I have my own life to watch over that I'm responsible for, but the love for old friends will never leave me and I look forward to the day I get to see them again."

Her philosophy on writing, especially characters and social constructs. How her ideas about race and gender also played a huge role in her books.

Edit. My goodness I love all the responses. I found this book truly special and I've just ordered the uncut version of Neverwhere, I'm very excited to jump back into his work. 

Edit 2. I also just wanted to state that this book has really motivated me to get back into writing. I have many story ideas I've put on paper and have wanted to check out Neil Gaiman's masterclass, so I believe this was the push I needed.

You can easily tell I slacked off because it's September but I'm going to try and read some more this year. Next year, I'll make it 10 books.

I read The Magicians Nephew, Less Than Zero, The Time Travelers Wife, Go Ask Alice, and The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night time. The Time Travelers Wife was my favorite. It's entered my top 3 favorite's. I will defend that book until the day I die. It makes me mad that I didn't come up with the idea first. Also, I will never watch the movie. I find the book to be unfilmmable.

Go Ask Alice was my least favorite. It has good ideas but once you find out that the story was made up, it loses it's impact and emotional grasp.

I'm going to read more books until the year ends. It makes me happy that I'm reading more. I hated reading growing up but then i just started reading books that I was interested in. Now I can't get enough. It's about time I read the books on my bookshelf.

Every 5 seconds, I'd get a new comment. I'm extremely grateful for your comments and nice words. This is the most up votes and awards I've gotten on Reddit. Thank you so much. To answer you're questions, the book I plan on reading is The DaVinci Code. I've heard great things about it. I also plan on reading Behind Closed Doors and The Maze Runner. As the years go on, I'm going to slowly increase the books I read. I've realized that it's ok to not finish a book you're not into. I guarantee that the best selling authors have started reading more books than finished. Like everyone here when they were in school, we we're forced to read. We had to read a certain amount of pages and write about those pages. It took the fun out of reading.  Now, you get to read on your own time and stuff you are interested in. There were kids who refused to read. It's ridiculous.

Thank you all again for the nice words. They've really made me happy."

It's a biography, and some of this stuff I knew from his stand-up - like how his dad couldn't be seen with him because having an interracial child was illegal, and how his mum *could* walk with him, but had to drop him like a bag of weed if a cop showed up - but it's told here with a lot more depth and seriousness.  It's harrowing in parts.  I've briefly studied British colonialism and the ""Africa Problem"" (the fact that people were already living on the bits of land that the British wanted), but I hadn't tracked how that extended to the lives of people living in Africa today and under Apartheid.  He talks about how his birth certificate had to have completely false details on it, how he wasn't allowed to play outside as a child because he would have been sent to a coloured (what mixed black-white people are known as in South Africa) orphanage, how he was arrested for being black while driving (literally the reason given by the officer), his years running a small crime ring in the hood, and builds up to the story of his mother being shot.

I couldn't tell you how many books I've read where the central conflict, or even a minor conflict/situation that ends up being central to the plot could have been resolved in less than 2 minutes if the people who were involved (who are often friends or at least associates) just sat down and talked to each other.

&#x200B;

The most recent and probably most egregious example of this that I've come across recently are Robin Hobb's FitzChivalry books. How much damage could have been avoided if Fitz had just sat down and had an actual discussion, like normal people do, with Chade or Verity or Molly or Dutiful or Shrewd or Burritch etc, etc? It's a trope I find incredibly annoying and seems to be used a lot in Fantasy (The Dresden Files is another example although not nearly as bad IMO), or it could well be that it seems that way because I read more fantasy than any other genre.

One longish one of 518 pages broke the trend and I finished it in three days, but it was such a letdown I’m slogging through my current novel even though I’m reasonably interested and it’s half the size.

It’s at the point where I have trust issues and almost don’t want to read anything because I’m sure I won’t like it.

I find myself repeatedly checking what page I’m on and wondering how long it will take to finish. 

And I get so excited at the thought of reading in general, I add books to my TBR faster than I can read them, partly because I can’t pick one, I’m 9/10 a slow reader and half the time it’s unavailable when I want it. But when it comes to to doing it, it often feels like a chore though I love it so much.

I have no idea how to escape this continual slump.

I carried this passion with me throughout the years, but when I slowly succumbed to the symptoms of depression, I completely lost sight of the things that were important to me.

Recently, I talked to several therapists, who encouraged me to speak about my childhood experiences. Reading was not encouraged in my household. Who had time to read when there was so much to do around the house? I recounted probably my worst childhood memory: when my mom took all of my books to the dumpster. One of the books was, at the time, my most prized possession. It was an extremely rare book that my favorite English teacher had given me the day that she told us she was moving to another school.

I was encouraged to let go of my remorse and the guilt I associated with reading and I was determined to rekindle my love for my favorite pass time. Out of the blue on the first day of classes, I picked up one of the ""dollar"" books from my university library. It was *Contagion* (fitting, I know). And today, 480 pages later, I finally finished it! I am so proud of myself and I just wanted to share. I know that the war against the chemicals in my brain isn't over yet, but I am calling this a small victory.

My wife decided to decorate our stairs with all our favourite books, inspired by a post she saw on Pinterest (personally I think my wife's are way better than the inspiration).

It took her quite a while and was a project initiated out of a money saving venture to avoid having to splash out on carpet money/fitting money (didn't trust me to lay carpet on stairs). I think this looks 100x better than any carpet.

The part of the stairs you walk on was painted in black matt gloss with fine grain sand mixed in, it is holding up really well to wear and tear!

I hope you guys agree on the talent required to pull off this feat :). Also approve of our choice of literature!

So when I was gifted the first these Legend of Drizzt books for Christmas last year I left them sitting on a shelf. Intent on getting around to reading them, some time. In mid-July I started reading Homeland, a chapter each night. Soon enough, my interest started to peak and I was through it by early august.


I started Exile then, more than doubling the pace of my reading. I finished Exile on the 21st, then proceeded to tear through Sojourn in less than a week.


I had never really been much of a reader, but I think something clicked when I went through these books. It's awesome to lose time when pouring through page after page. I even started to askew whatever happenstances that might have otherwise distracted me, in favor of reading instead.

Now I'm left with the wait to order the Icewind Dale Trilogy, and I think, a new hobby.


I would try to discuss more in depth all that I have read, but I'm still trying to digest it now. I just needed to share this excitement with someone.

5qwtxl,books,'A Peoples History of the United States' by Howard Zinn should be Mandatory Reading in Public Education,"One of the most eye opening experiences I've ever had, came about while reading the first chapter of 'A People's History of the United States.' In nauseating detail, Howard Zinn describes what actually happened after Christopher Columbus's first arrival in the Caribbean. In less then two years of brutal enslavement, rape, torture, and pillaging, Columbus and his followers massacred the native Haitian population, setting the seeds for the America we know today.
 
One particularly jarring passage, is Zinn quoting what Columbus wrote in his diary after first landing;

'The Indians are so naive, and free with their possessions, that anyone who has not witnessed so would fail to believe it. They were well-built, with good bodies and handsome features.... They do not bear arms, and do not know them, for when I showed them a sword, they took it by the edge and cut themselves out of ignorance. They have no iron. Their spears are made of cane... They would make fine slaves... With fifty men we could subjugate them all and make them do whatever we wish.' 

When I first read this a year ago, in my freshman year at college, I was struck most notably with a vivid sense of indignation. For all my life, I had been blatantly lied to. Christopher Columbus was not a hero. He did not welcome the Americas into the 'European enlightenment'. He was the architect of a genocide, just like Hitler, Stalin, and every other historically 'evil' figure. Throughout all of high school, not once was it mentioned that the worst genocide in known History was committed by the same guy we have a Holiday named after. 

In high school history, they do spend some time covering The Trail of Tears, Slavery, and the Evils of the Jim Crow era, but its always done so in this theatric rendition of 'America' triumphing over intolerance. 

Lincoln was a hero-even though he sent six hundred, thousand Americans to their deaths in a war which was primarily fought for economic purposes. J.P. Morgan, and Rockefeller, were savvy, revolutionary business men-even though they reduced half of the population to slave-like conditions in order to achieve their 'maximum profits'.

From reading 'A peoples history,' I gained an objective stance on the history of America, instead of that idealized, fictitious narrative regurgitated in every high school history class. 

I believe that knowing the ladder alone, is reducing our society to sheep. The majority of us only understand this idealized America because it's all we're aware of. So, when we're faced with the actual America in practice, and we don't know what the hell is going on, we think everybody else is just sullying our idealized pictures of the country. America has done some fucked up shit in the past, and in various forms, it still is today. It's important to be aware of this.


I'm not trying to make some overtly liberal point here. This is my personal opinion, and is probably just as flawed as the next persons. But what I am saying, is that the objective history which led me to this opinion is currently being quarantined off from public knowledge. After reading this book, the current, strange state of western society made a lot more sense to me. The tragedy however, is that I only ever read it because I went to college.

The male whale recognized it as the same ship that had harpooned his father many years earlier. He said to the female whale, ""Lets both swim under the ship and blow out of our air holes at the same time and it should cause the ship to turn over and sink."" They tried it and sure enough, the ship turned over and quickly sank. 

Soon however, the whales realized the sailors had jumped overboard and were swimming to the safety of shore. The male was enraged that they were going to get away and told the female, ""Let's swim after them and gobble them up before they reach the shore."" At this point, he realized the female was becoming reluctant to follow him. ""Look,"" she said, ""I went along with the blow job, but I absolutely refuse to swallow the seamen.""

Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ""OK, Dave, how about Tom Cruise?""

""No dramas boss, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it.""
So Dave and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door, and Tom Cruise shouts,

 ""Dave! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!""

Although impressed, Dave's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky.

""No, no, just name anyone else,"" Dave says.

""President Obama,"" his boss quickly retorts.

""Yup,"" Dave says, ""Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington,"" and off they go. 

At the White House, Obama spots Dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up.""

Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced.
After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.

""Pope Francis,"" his boss replies.

""Sure!"" says Dave. ""I've known the Pope for years."" So off they fly to Rome.

Dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when Dave says, ""This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope.""
He disappears into the crowd headed towards the Vatican.

Sure enough, half an hour later Dave emerges with the Pope on the balcony, but by the time Dave returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.

Making his way to his boss' side, Dave asks him, ""What happened?""

His boss looks up and says, ""It was the final straw... you and the Pope came out on to the balcony and the man next to me said, 'Who the fuck is that on the balcony with Dave?'"

6nb0uo,Jokes,"Once upon a time, in the magical fantasy kingdom, there lived a young monk named Sam.","His order was renowned for their beautiful choral singing. They trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art.  Their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below.

Sam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully intricate note of pure magic.  Everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone.  And all the realm realized, instantly, that it was Sam, and Sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored Magical Notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before Sam had ever reached one.

And on Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again.  This time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after.  As the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam had found the Second Note... 

And the next year on Sam's birthday, the town had realized there was a pattern involved.  This time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hit the glorious Third Note.  People cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo.  Words cannot do justice to the experience.  The town flourished, as Sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings.

And on it went for the next few years, the Magical Notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, Sam's 25th birthday.  All at first seemed as normal... until Sam hit the Magical Note.  From the start, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant.  Sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage.  He doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the Magical Note that he knew must be there.

Suddenly, to the horror of all, Sam spontaneously combusted!  The two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains.  Soon the entire monastery was aflame.  By a miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor Sam.

The townsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief.

The mayor approached the lead monk of the order.  ""What happened?"" he asked, exasperated.

The old monk shook his head sadly. ""Isn't it obvious?"" he said. ""Sam sung Note 7.""

8queov,Jokes,[Serious] Just a reminder to be careful when telling jokes that may be offensive.,"A few days ago I was talking to some friends, and friends of those friends, at a bar.

I decided to break the ice with the new friends with a few jokes, most of which went down very well...until I decided to tell a few more offensive ones...and picked the worst possible one to start with.

Here's the joke I told:

""What do you do if you see an epileptic having a fit in the bath?

Throw your washing (laundry if you're American) in.""

One of the new friends instantly became enraged and swung for me. When I asked him what the hell his problem was he replied that his younger brother was epileptic and died in the bath many years ago.

Obviously I felt mortified as I didn't know about it, and said ""I'm so sorry to hear that. Did he drown?""

""No,"" replied the guy. ""He choked on a sock."""

Amazed, he takes the money, puts a bag of chops in the dog's mouth,and quickly closes the shop.
He follows the dog and watches him wait for a green light, look both ways, and
trot across the road to a bus-stop.
The dog checks the timetable and sits on the bench.
When a bus arrives, he walks around to the front and looks at the number, then boards the bus.
The butcher follows, dumbstruck.
As the bus travels out into the suburbs, the dog takes in the scenery.
After awhile he stands on his back paws to push the ""stop"" bell,
then the butcher follows him off.
The dog runs up to a house and drops his bag on the step.
He goes back down the path, takes a big run, and throws himself -Whap!- against the door.
He does this again and again. No answer.
So he jumps on a wall, walks around the garden, beats his head against a window,
jumps off, and waits at the front door.
A big guy opens it and starts cursing and shouting at the dog.
The butcher runs up and screams at the guy: ""What the hell are you doing?
This dog's a genius!""
The owner responds, ""Genius, my ass.........
It's the second time this week he's forgotten his keys!"""
abxd7g,Jokes,A mailman notices a mailbox with the flag up,"So, he opens the box and picks up the letter.  He glances at it briefly to make sure it is stamped, and then puts it in his bag with his other letters.  When he gets back to his office, the letter goes in a big bin with all of the other out-going mail.  He thinks nothing of it, and finishes his day.

A few days later, he delivers the exact same letter to the same house that he picked it up from.  He glances at the mailing address and observes that it is indeed the same as the return address.  Anyone can make a mistake, so the mailman puts the letter in the mailbox so that the customer can readdress it for its proper recipient.  He thinks nothing of it and finishes his day.

The next day, the mailman sees the same mailbox with the flag up.  He opens the box and again sees the same letter, nothing changed, but with a new stamp on it.  The mailman is perplexed, and thinking to save the customer both time and money, decides to ring the doorbell and inquire about the letter.

*Ding-dong, ding-dong.  Ding-dong, ding-dong.  Ding-dong, Ding-dong.*

The door opens and standing there is a stout Buddhist monk, dressed in traditional garb.

“Pardon me, sir,” the mailman says, “but you seem to be trying to mail this letter again, and without any changes to the address, it’s only going to end up back at your home in a few days.”

“Ah, my letter.  Thank you so much for mailing it the other day, it was greatly appreciated.  Please do so again” replies the Buddhist monk.

“But sir,” says mailman, “you will only waste a stamp, and this letter will be re-delivered to your home a few days from now.”

“But that is my intention, dear man,” replies the Buddhist monk.  “You see, reposting is the best way to get karma.”

The C.E.O says ""I'll be a waiter. All you do is carry food back and forth. This'll be a breeze"" so he is teleported to a restaurant. After about an hour, all the annoying customers drive him insane, so he smashes his plates on the ground and gives up.

The elderly couple walks haltingly along, leaning on each other for support aided by walking sticks. Finally, they get to the back of the tavern and make their way to the fence The old lady lifts her skirt and the old man drops his trousers. As she leans against the fence, the old man moves in.. 

Then suddenly they erupt into the most furious sex that the policeman has ever seen. This goes on for about ten minutes while both are making loud noises and moaning and screaming. Finally, they both collapse, panting on the ground.

The policeman is amazed. He thinks he has learned something about life and old age that he didn't know.

htgrvp,Jokes,The Queen's breasts,"Once upon a time there lived a beautiful Queen with large breasts.


Sid, the Dragon Slayer, obsessed over the Queen for this reason. He knew that the penalty for his desire would be death, should he try to touch them, but he had to try.


One day Sid revealed his secret desire to his colleague, Nathan


the Erudite lawyer, the King's chief adviser. Nathan thought about this and said that he could arrange for Sid to more than satisfy his desire, but it would cost him 1000 gold coins to arrange it. Without pause, Sid readily agreed to the scheme.


The next day, Nathan got a batch of itching powder and poured a little bit into the Queen's bra while she bathed. Soon after she dressed, the itching commenced and grew intense.


Upon being summoned to the Royal Chambers to address this incident, Nathan informed the King and Queen that only a special saliva, if applied for four hours, would cure this type of itch, and Nathan advised that only the saliva of Sid would work as the antidote to cure the itch.


The King, eager to help his Queen, quickly summoned Sid to their chambers. Nathan then slipped Sid the antidote for the itching powder, which he put into his mouth, and for the next four hours, Sid worked passionately on the Queen's large and magnificent breasts. The Queen's itching was eventually relieved, and Sid left satisfied and hailed as a hero.


Upon returning to his chamber, Sid found Nathan demanding his payment of 1000 gold coins. With his obsession now satisfied, Sid couldn't have cared less knowing that Nathan could never report this matter to the King and with a laugh told him to get lost.


The next day, Nathan slipped a massive dose of the same itching powder into the King's underwear. The King immediately summoned Sid."

Johnny walked up and sat on Santa’s lap and said “Santa, for Christmas I want a god damn new baseball bat and I want it to be put under my god damn bed.  I want a god damn new baseball glove, and I want it put under the god damn Christmas tree.  And Santa, I want a god damn new bike and I want it put under a god damn tarp in the god damn shed.”

Santa, in complete shock, pulled Little Johnny’s parents aside and said “In all my years, I have never seen a little boy with such a foul mouth.”

His parents replied “We know, but we have no idea what to do about his behavior.  We’ve tried everything.”

Santa thought about it and said “Here’s what we’ll do to teach him a lesson, every place that Johnny asked for a present, we’ll put a pile of dog poop.”  The parents agreed to try Santa’s plan.

On Christmas morning, Little Johnny woke up and immediately looked under his bed.  Seeing the pile of poop, he ran downstairs to the Christmas tree and checked underneath.

Finding another pile of poop under the tree, he ran out the door and threw open the shed door.  

Finding a tarp in the shed, he quickly pulled back the tarp and found yet another pile of poop.

Johnny walked out of the shed and started looking all around the yard.  After a while his parents asked him sarcastically “So Little Johnny, what did you get for Christmas?”

Without missing a beat, Johnny looked at his parents and said “I think I got a god damned dog, but I can’t find the motherfucker!”

Each of you must gather 10 fruits of the same kind and bring them to me.”

aqzgfm,Jokes,"Several centuries ago, the Pope decreed that all the Jews had to convert to Catholicism or leave Italy. There was a huge outcry from the Jewish community, so the Pope offered a deal. He'd have a religious debate with the leader of the Jewish community...","If the Jews won, they could stay in Italy; if the Pope won, they'd have to convert or leave.

The Jewish people met and picked an aged and wise Rabbi to represent them in the debate.

However, as the Rabbi spoke no Italian, and the Pope spoke no Hebrew, they agreed that it would be a 'silent' debate.

On the chosen day, the Pope and the Rabbi sat opposite each other

The Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers.

The Rabbi looked back and raised one finger.

Next, the Pope waved his finger around his head. The Rabbi pointed to the ground where he sat.

The Pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine.

The Rabbi pulled out an apple.

With that, the Pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the Rabbi was too clever. The Jews could stay in Italy!

Later the cardinals met with the Pope and asked him what had happened. The Pope said, 'First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one God common to both our beliefs.' 'Then, I waved my finger around my head to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us.' 'Finally, I pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us of all our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin.' 'He bested me at every move and I could not continue!'

Meanwhile, the Jewish community gathered to ask the Rabbi how he had won. 'I don't have a clue!!!' the Rabbi said. 'First, he told me that we had three days to get out of Italy, so I gave him the finger.' Then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of Jews, so I told him that we were staying right here. 'And then what?' asked a woman. 'Who knows...' said the Rabbi. 'He took out his lunch, so I took out mine!'"

dxsoki,Jokes,Two boys in Egypt free a crocodile...,"In a small village in Egypt lived two orphan boys, Set and Amenhotep. They always watched out for each other, well past their years of childhood and into their time as young adults.

One day, the two were walking outside the village when they saw a crocodile trapped in a poacher’s snare. The two young men, sympathetic to a creature in need, approached the crocodile and released it from the trap.

Once freed, the crocodile transformed into a wispy, glowing fairy! “Thank you, young men” said the fairy, “Your hearts are truly selfless, and I will grant each of you one wish. What are your names?”

“This is my friend Set, and you can call me ‘Ep’”, said Amenhotep.

“Very well, Ep” said the fairy “What is the desire of your heart?”

“I wish I was the strongest man in the world!” Amenhotep wished. 

“Very well”, said the fairy, “but you must always use your strength to help others.” Smoke gathered around Amenhotep, and when the smoke cleared Ep was 7 foot six and rippling with muscles. 

The fairy turned to Set “And what is your wish, Set?”
Set responded “I never want to be poor again! I wish for money!”

“Very well,” said the fairy. Smoke gathered in front of the two of them, and when the smoke cleared a small elf remained, bowing to the two boys. “Greetings, sirs! My name is Elmon, and I am here to serve!”

“Elmon is an expert in all things money,” said the fairy, “He will help you make wise decisions and turn any business profitable, but will only help you so long as he is only asked to do good for your fellow man.”

Amenhotep and Set were inseparable. True to his word, Amenhotep used his great strength to build many houses for people in need. Set helped, as well, but his comparatively small size next to the now massive Amenhotep earned him the nickname “Imp”. With Elmon’s financial savvy, the two started a non-profit dedicated to building houses for the less fortunate, and Elmon kept all their paperwork in perfect order.  

Years passed, and the two lived very fulfilling lives helping the homeless. Amenhotep met a girl while building houses and the two got married and had a beautiful baby boy, Josep. 

Ep and Set’s business expanded globally. 15 years passed and Amenhotep grew kinder and more generous, giving to people in need at any of the places he went to build houses. Set built a campus in Cairo for the headquarters of their business, and directed global efforts. Over the years, Set lost touch with the people he was helping, and became more focused on business expansion and money of the business. 

As all fathers do, Amenhotep wanted his son to eventually take over the business and help the next generation of needful people find purpose in their lives. He sent Josep to the the HQ in Cairo to learn business from Set. Once there, Josep was surprised to find that much of the financial success was due in large part to the financial savvy of Elmon, the elf.

Josep spent months at HQ learning how to run the business. While there, Set decided that it was time to expand the company into a more profitable venture. Instead of building houses for the needy, he drafted up a plan to buy up land around urban areas and construct rental properties at expensive prices while preventing construction of new, affordable housing. He sent Josep with the proposal to Elmon to determine the financial logistics.

Upon reading the proposal and its ill-nature’s effect on Set’s fellow man, Elmon keeled over and died, instantly.

Josep was shocked, and ran to alert Set right away, who wailed in dismay at the loss of his financial mastermind. In a rage, he accused Josep of killing Elmon, and sent the teenager to jail.

Amenhotep, hearing of the distress, caught the first flight back to Cairo to find himself neck-deep in a legal battle between him and his old friend.

Without the financial and legal savvy of Elmon, Set’s case was a mess. Amenhotep, distraught, tried to reason with his childhood friend. “Come, Imp, release my boy and call off the lawsuit. Let’s use our energy to help those in need and not further what we both know is a fruitless path.”

Set refused, furiously gathering circumstantial evidence to bring to the court to frame Josep for Elmon’s murder.

The case was brought before the court, but Set’s claims were weak and unsupported. The judge, thoroughly disgusted with the lack of evidence from the prosecution, dismissed the case outright.

Obviously, Ep’s teen didn’t kill Imp’s elf."

7dylhe,Jokes,There was this tramp.,"One cold winter's morning he was walking along a country road, when he heard a cry for help from a nearby lake.

Without a moment's hesitation he ran out onto the ice and slipped and slided over to a little girl. He managed to pull her out without breaking the ice further and carried her back to the road. He took off his coat and wrapped her in it then began looking for a car to flag down.

Coincidentally the father drives up. ""How can I ever thank you sir?"" he says after putting his daughter into the warmth of the limo. ""Just name your price - I'm a wealthy man.""

""Ah, well..."" stammers the tramp, ""... uh, I'm a little short of cash, perhaps you could help me out.""

""Oh dear,"" says the father, ""I don't carry much cash with me, I only have ten pounds - but come home with me and I'll get more from the safe.""

""No! No!"" says the tramp, ""Why ten pounds is more money than I've seen in my whole life - that'll be plenty.""

""Ten pounds,"" thinks the tramp, ""I'm rich! I'm rich!"" and off he goes to the town to buy himself a holiday.

He finds a travel agent, walks in - much to the disgust of the staff - and goes up to the desk. ""I'll have one holiday please!""

""Ahem, which holiday would sir like?"" asked the girl at the desk, forcing a smile.

""Oh, any holiday I don't mind, anything up to ten pounds,"" replies the tramp.

""TEN POUNDS! You'll NEVER get a holiday for ten pounds,"" says the girl incredulously.

She goes into the back of the shop, and searches in the deepest, dustiest filing drawers she can find. There - to her amazement - she finds an old file.

""Well you'll never believe it,"" she says to the tramp, back in the shop. ""I've got you a holiday - its a super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class round the world cruise - and it costs ten pounds.""

""Yippee!"" exclaims the tramp, ""I'll take it!""

A few days later he arrives at the port, and there in the dock is the most beautiful, most elaborately decorated, most expensive looking ocean-going liner he has ever seen.

""Get off my ship ye dirty bum!"" shouts a voice, and an irate captain storms down the gangplank and kicks the tramp down onto the dockside.

""But I've got my ticket!"", responds the tramp, ""super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class, and I want on!""

""Well okay,"" says the captain, ""but you can't come on just now, I don't want my first-class passengers seeing you. Come back at midnight when it's dark and I'll let you on then.""

So the tramp finds himself a quiet spot among some cargo cases on the dockside, and he falls asleep.

""Psst,"" says a voice, waking him with a start. It was the captain.

""Hurry up, it's midnight, let's get you to your cabin.""

The tramp toddles after the captain, along the dockside, up the gangway, and onto the ship - and what a ship!

First they went down through the first class level: Oriental carpets - 6"" pile. A genuine Rembrandt on every wall. Leave your shoes outside for cleaning, and the steward brings a new pair. 24 ct gold trim everywhere.

Then the second class: As above, but perhaps the carpets were only 3"" deep, and so on...

3rd, 4th, 5th class, down past the casinos, and the ballrooms, down through the crew's quarters, down through the galleys, and the engine rooms, until finally, at the lowest point in the ship, against the very hull, the captain opens a watertight door into a tiny 7' x 4' cabin, with a hammock, a bedside table, and an alarm clock.

""Sheer luxury!"" exclaimed the tramp, ""A room of my very own.""

""I'm glad you like it,"" replies the captain, ""but there is one more thing... Your class of ticket only allows you to use the facilities of the ship, at night - when all the other passengers are asleep. So that's what the alarm clock is for. Enjoy your cruise.""

Well the cruise began, and the tramp had a whale of a time. Sleeping by day, and up on deck at night - he loved it. One-man-tennis, clay pigeon shooting, more food than he'd ever seen...

Then one morning, a week or so into the cruise, the tramp decided he'd have a go on the diving board of the pool. He had just enough time for one dive before he had to go below.

He climbed up the ladder, stepped onto the board tip, bounced, and dived...

... and what a dive...!

Perfectly poised in the air, he hit the water without so much as a ripple.

Now unknown to him, the captain - who'd grown rather fond of the poor old tramp - was standing watching this.

""That was amazing!"" exclaimed the captain, ""Where did you learn to dive like that?""

""Um, well I've never actually dived before,"" replied the tramp.

""Well that's incredible!"" says the captain, ""I've never seen..."" He broke off. ""Hey, I've got an idea"", he started again. ""How would you like to train a bit, and we'll put on a show for the other passengers. I'll pay you, and you can then afford to go first class!""

""It's a deal!"" says our man. For the next 3 weeks the tramp practices like he's never practiced before. Back-flips, front-flips, triple-back sideways axled dives, you name it he tried it.

Then one morning the captain comes to talk. ""Okay, I'd like you to stay in your cabin for the next 2 days. We're going to erect a high diving board for you.""

""Okay,"" agreed the tramp.

Two days passed, and the big day arrived. The ship was humming with excitement. Everyone wanted to see the mystery diver. The captain had provided the tramp with a new pair of swimming trunks and he wore these as he stepped out onto the sun-beaten deck. Gasps of astonishment from the crowd, and a hushed awe. Higher than the eye could see, towering up and up, rose a slender column of metal.

""Well, tramp,"" said the captain, shaking his hand, ""Let's see what you can do."" And with that the Captain handed him a walkie talkie. And the tramp began to climb...

The tramp streaked down towards the pool, did a last triple flip, and dove...

NOT A RIPPLE ON THE SURFACE!

DOWN THROUGH THE WATER!

SMASHED THROUGH THE POOL BOTTOM!

DOWN THROUGH THE FIRST DECK!

SMASHING THROUGH THE SECOND!

DOWN!

DOWN!

THROUGH THE CREW'S QUARTERS!

THROUGH THE ENGINE ROOMS!

SMASHING THROUGH HIS OWN LITTLE CABIN!

AND DOWN THROUGH THE DOUBLE-STRENGTH STEEL HULL OF THE SHIP!

STILL DOWN...!

DEEPER,

DEEPER INTO THE MURKY DEPTHS,

TILL.........

SMASH!

Into the sea bed, sinking a 37' shaft in the process.

Desperate for air he struggle out of the shaft, his lungs bursting he swam frantically for the surface.

Up and up, desperate, gasping...

Out of the water, up the ladder onto the deck of the ship, into a throng wild with acclaim.

""HERO!"" ""WONDERFUL!"" ""AMAZING!"" ""GOOD SHOW THAT!""

And handing him a heated towel the captain spoke, as a hush fell over the crowd.

""Well tramp, I have NEVER seen anything like that, EVER. That was the most *STUPENDOUS* piece of diving I have ever seen.""

The tramp blushed.

The captain went on, ""but tell me, most amazing of all is how you survived smashing through this boat after you dived - how did you do it.""

And the tramp looked at the captain, and the crowd and replied modestly: ""Well you see...

""For me to tell you, I'll need $49.95""

The captain outrageously asked why.

The tramp said

So, in amazement, he takes the twenty and walks to the cash register to make the change. While he's standing in front of the cash register he stops for a second and thinks to himself, ""Let me try something here and see if the gorilla notices anything."" 

So he walks back over to the gorilla and hands him a dollar change. The gorilla doesn't say anything, he just sits there sipping the martini. After a few minutes the bartender just can't take it anymore. 

""You know,"" he says to the gorilla, ""we don't get too many gorillas in here.""

Later during the reception, we were both starving and decided to head over to the buffet to get food. On the way we passed the drink table, where about six people were waiting to get a fruity drink from a bowl.

As we passed, they all said in unison, ""You may now kiss the bride!"" My wife got giddy and gave me a big kiss, which I of course returned.

As we walked away I asked, ""Why did *they* tell us to kiss and not the priest?""

Donald thought that sounded pretty good, so the devil opened the door to the first room.

In it was Barack Obama and a large pool of water. Barack kept diving in, and surfacing, empty handed. Over, and over he dived in and surfaced with nothing. Such was his fate in hell.

""No,"" Donald said. ""I don't think so. I'm not a good swimmer and it would ruin my hair.

Sure enough a few days later the monk shows up with a toolkit in hand, the man shows the monk that his fence has been ripped out of the ground and that he needs to replace it.

About an hour later the monk walks in and tells the man he is finished, and when the man goes outside he sees that the fence is perfect, thinking he can't just tell the monk to leave after doing such a great job for free he invites the monk inside for a cup of coffee.

The man then starts talking to the monk, ""It surprised me to see a monk offering services for fence repair, why do you do it?"" he asked

the monk replied ""Religious reasons.""

The man then says ""I don't know much about Buddhism, why do you need to repair fences?""

""Because"" the monk replied, ""You would be surprised at the amount of karma you get for reposting.""

Nobody gives a damn. Everyone is sleeping, reading, looking out the window, etc.  Flight attendants pretend to not hear them, as they also don't give a damn.

""They really wouldn't care then, would they?"" says Timothy.

So Jeremiah and Timothy have wild sex on the plane.

Later, when the plane arrives to the airport and the people are leaving, the stewardess sees an old man who threw up all over his shirt, even his pants are soaking in the filth.

The first guy answers, ""That's easy, we'll catch him fast because he only has one eye!""

The policeman says, ""Well...uh...that's because the picture I showed is his side profile.""

Slightly flustered by this ridiculous response, he flashes the picture for 5 seconds at the second guy and asks him, ""This is your suspect, how would you recognize him?""

The second guy smiles, flips his hair and says, ""Ha! He'd be too easy to catch because he only has one ear!""

The policeman angrily responds, ""What's the matter with you two?!!? Of course only one eye and one ear are showing because it's a picture of his side profile! Is that the best answer you can come up with?""

Extremely frustrated at this point, he shows the picture to the third guy and in a very testy voice asks, ""This is your suspect, how would you recognize him?

He quickly adds, ""Think hard before giving me a stupid answer.""

The third guy looks at the picture intently for a moment and says, ""The suspect wears contact lenses.""

The policeman is surprised and speechless because he really doesn't know himself if the suspect wears contacts or not.

""Well, that's an interesting answer. Wait here for a few minutes while I check his file and I'll get back to you on that.""

He leaves the room and goes to his office, checks the suspect's file on his computer and comes back with a beaming smile on his face.

""Wow! I can't believe it. It's TRUE! The suspect does, in fact, wear contact lenses. Good work! How were you able to make such an astute observation?""

""That's easy..."" the third guy replied. ""He can't wear regular glasses because he only has one eye and one ear."""

He figures the early tee-time will discourage her.

The woman says this may be a problem and asks if she can be up to 15 minutes late.

They roll their eyes, but say, ""Okay.""

She's there at 6:30 am. sharp and beats all of them with an eye-opening 2-under par round.

She's fun and pleasant and the guys are impressed.

They congratulate her and invite her back the next week.

She smiles, and says, ""I'll be there at 6:30, or 6:45.""

The next week she again shows up at 6:30 sharp.

Only this time, she plays left-handed.

The three guys are incredulous as she still beats them with an even par round, despite playing with her off-hand.

They're totally amazed.

They can't figure her out.

She's very pleasant and a gracious winner.

They invite her back again, but each man harbors a burning desire to beat her.

The third week, she's 15 minutes late, which irritates the guys.

This week she plays right-handed and narrowly beats all three of them.

The men grumble that her late arrival is petty gamesmanship on her part.

However, she's so charming and complimentary of their strong play, they can't hold a grudge.

This woman is a riddle no one can figure out.

They have a couple of beers in the Clubhouse and finally, one of the men asks her, ""How do you decide if you're going to golf right-handed or left-handed?""

The lady blushes, and grins. ""When my dad taught me to play golf, I learned that I was ambidextrous."" she replies. ""I like to switch back and forth.""

""When I got married after college, I discovered my husband always sleeps in the nude. From then on, I developed a silly habit. Right before I leave in the morning for golf practice, I pull the covers off him. If his willie points to the right, I golf right-handed; if it points to the left, I golf left-handed.""

The guys think this is hysterical.

Astonished at this bizarre information, one of the guys says, ""What if it's pointing straight up?""

She says, ""Then, I'm fifteen minutes late."""

No more was said about the statue, not even later that night when they went to sleep.
Around two in the morning the husband got out of bed, went to the kitchen and returned a while later with a sandwich and a glass of milk.

9mrfjy,Jokes,"4 years ago today, I shared the worst joke I ever created. Here it is again for those that missed it.","There are two identical twin brothers that live together. One happens to be a well-respected dentist, and the other can't seem to keep a job. Instead of actively looking for work, he likes to sit around at home. One Saturday, the dentist is hungry, and puts his brother on the spot. He tells him to get off his lazy behind and go get them some food. After some protest, the lazy brother takes the car and leaves for the store. In the meantime, the dentist takes a nap on his day off. He turns off his phone so he won't be interrupted.  
  
About 30 minutes later, the lazy brother gets into a head-on collision in the intersection by the grocery store. His vital signs are fading; he's unconscious and barely moving. An ambulance picks him up and rushes him to the hospital. He ends up in the Emergency Room under observation, but his condition is critical. They try calling his dentist brother, but he doesn't pick up because his phone is off.  
  
The dentist wakes to a knock on the door. Suspecting a solicitor, he ignores it, but the knocking continues. Eventually, he resolves to get up and yell at the person at the door. When he does, he reveals--- the grim reaper. He is just as he appears in movies; a full skeleton underneath a tattered cloak.  
  
The grim reaper swears. ""Oh no! This always happens with identical twins"".  
  
""What do you mean?"" asks the dentist.  
  
""Well... if you must know, your brother was in a critical car accident, and I've come to take him to the underworld. I'm afraid his time on Earth has ended. I'll take my leave now.""  
  
The dentist is noticeably upset. He says ""Wait! Isn't there some way I can challenge you for my brother's life? After all, YOU made the mistake. Certainly there must be a way I can bargain for his life.""  
  
The grim reaper asks ""What do you have in mind?""  
  
The dentist thinks. ""How about a challenge? If I beat you, you let my brother go free.""  
  
The grim reaper laughs. ""I will beat you in any challenge. What challenge do you propose?""  
  
The dentist smiles. ""I propose we see who has the cleanest teeth. 5 minutes of brushing each, then we decide.""  
  
""Very well"" says the grim reaper, who makes his way to the bathroom.  
  
Once there, he pulls back his tattered cloak to reveal his skull. It's glistening. He takes a toothbrush from the bathroom, loads it with toothpaste, and brushes. After 5 minutes, the shiniest teeth anyone has ever seen glisten and make the room bright. The grim reaper grins. ""You are foolish human. But, you are entitled to your chance.""  
  
The dentist takes another toothbrush, loads it with toothpaste, and starts brushing like a madman. When his 5 minutes are up, he spits out the paste. He smiles.  
  
It's unbelievable.  
  
The shine from the dentist's teeth is so beautiful that he can see the grim reaper's reflection in his perfectly clean teeth.  
  
The winner is obvious. The grim reaper hangs his head in shame. ""You win, human. This time. Your brother will live."" He disappears in a puff of smoke. At the same instant, the bed-ridden brother wakes up in the hospital. Not only is he uninjured, he seems perfectly healthy. Suddenly, the phone by his bed rings. It's his brother, the dentist. He picks up. ""Hey bro. You'll never believe what happened. Apparently, I went out to the market and got hit by a car. They say I almost died.""  
  
The dentist smiles on the phone and says. ""That's interesting, bro. Today you might say that I also had a brush with death."""

Without pause Nick readily agreed to the scheme. 

The next day, Horatio made a batch of itching powder and poured a little bit into the Queen's bra while she bathed. Soon after she dressed, the itching commenced and grew intense. 

Upon being summoned to the Royal Chambers to address this incident, Horatio informed the King and Queen that only a special saliva, if applied for four hours, would cure this type of itch, and that tests had shown that only the saliva of Nick would work as the antidote to cure the itch.

The King, eager to help his Queen, quickly summoned Nick to their chambers. 

Horatio then slipped Nick the antidote for the itching powder, which he put into his mouth, and for the next four hours, Nick worked passionately on the Queen's large and magnificent breasts. The Queen's itching was eventually relieved, and Nick left satisfied and hailed as a hero.

Upon returning to his chamber, Nick found Horatio demanding his payment of 1000 gold coins. With his obsession now satisfied, Nick couldn't have cared less knowing that Horatio could never report this matter to the King and with a laugh told him to get lost.

The next day, Horatio slipped a massive dose of the same itching powder into the King's underwear. The King immediately summoned Nick.

The moral of the story - Pay your bills !!"

When he looked at the sky, he couldn't tell what the weather was going to be. Nevertheless, to be on the safe side, he replied to his tribe that the winter was indeed going to be cold and that the members of the village should collect firewood to be prepared.

Also, being a practical leader, after several days he got an idea. He went to the phone booth, called the National Weather Service and asked, ""Is the coming winter going to be cold?""

""It looks like this winter is going to be quite cold indeed,"" the meteorologist at the weather service responded. So the Chief went back to his people and told them to collect even more wood in order to be prepared.

A week later, he called the National Weather Service again. ""Is it going to be a very cold winter?""

""Yes,"" the man at National Weather Service again replied,""it's definitely going to be a very cold winter."" The Chief again went back to his people and ordered them to collect every scrap of wood they could find.

Two weeks later, he called the National Weather Service again. ""Are you absolutely sure that the winter is going to be very cold?""

""Absolutely,"" the man replied. ""It's going to be one of the coldest winters ever.""

""How can you be so sure?"" the Chief asked.

The policeman is amazed. He thinks he has learned something about life and old age that he didn't know.

After about half an hour of lying on the ground recovering, the old couple struggle to their feet and put their clothes back on. The policeman, is still watching and thinks to himself, this is truly amazing, I've got to ask them what their secret is.

So, as the couple passes, he says to them, ""Excuse me, but that was something else. You must've had a fantastic sex life together. Is there some sort of secret to this?""

Shaking, the old man is barely able to reply,

""Fifty years ago that wasn't an electric fence."""
703i6r,Jokes,A woman brought a very limp duck into a veterinary surgeon....,"A woman brought a very limp duck into a veterinary surgeon. As she laid her pet on the table, the vet pulled out his stethoscope and listened to the bird's chest. 

After a moment or two, the vet 
shook his head and sadly said, ""I'm sorry, your duck, Cuddles, has passed away."" 

The distressed woman wailed, 
""Are you sure?""
""Yes, I am sure. Your duck is dead,"" replied 
the vet.. 

""How can you be so sure?"" she protested. ""I mean you haven't done any testing on him or anything. He might just be in a coma or 
something."" 

The vet rolled his eyes, turned around and left the room. He returned a few minutes later 
with a black Labrador Retriever. As the duck's owner looked on in amazement, the dog stood on his hind legs, put his front paws on the examination table and sniffed the duck from top to bottom. He then looked up at the vet with sad eyes and shook his head. 

The vet patted the dog on the head and took it out of the room. A few minutes later he returned with a cat. The cat jumped on the table and also delicately sniffed the bird from head to foot. The cat sat
back on its haunches, shook its head, meowed softly and strolled out of the room. 

The vet looked at the woman and said, ""I'm sorry, but as I said, this is most definitely, 100% certifiably, a dead duck."" 

The vet turned to his computer terminal, hit a few keys and 
produced a bill, which he handed to the woman..

The duck's owner, still in shock, took the bill. ""$150!"" she cried, ""$150 just to tell me my duck is dead!""

The vet shrugged, ""I'm sorry. If you had just taken my word for it, 
the bill would have been $20, but with the Lab Report and the Cat Scan, it's now $150.""

ao79t3,Jokes,Two rednecks flew to Canada on a hunting trip.,"  

 They chartered a small plane to take them into the Rockies for a week hunting moose.   
 

They managed to bag 6. As they were loading the plane to return, the Pilot said the plane could take only 4 moose.   
 

The two guys objected strongly. ""Last year we shot six. The pilot let us take them all and he had the same plane as yours.""   
 

Reluctantly, the pilot gave in and all six were loaded. The plane took  off. However, while attempting to cross some mountains, even on full power, the little plane couldn't handle the load and went down.   
 

Somehow, surrounded by the moose bodies, only the two rednecks survived the   
 crash.   
 

After climbing out of the wreckage, Billy Ray asked Billy Bob, ""Any idea where we   
 are?""   
 

Billy Bob replied, ""I think we're pretty close to where we crashed last year."""

id8zqd,Jokes,The first female president,"
The year is 2028 and the United States has elected the first woman as well as the first Jewish president, Sarah Goldstein.

She calls up her mother a few weeks after Election Day and says, ""So, Mom, I assume you'll be coming to my inauguration?""

""I don't think so. It's a ten-hour drive, your father isn't as young as he used to be, and my arthritis is acting up again.""

""Don't worry about it, Mom, I'll send Air Force One to pick you up and take you home. And a limousine will pick you up at your door.""

""I don't know. Everybody will be so fancy-schmantzy; what on earth would I wear?

Sarah replies, ""I'll make sure you have a wonderful gown, custom-made by the best designer in New York.""

""Honey,"" Mom complains, ""you know I can't eat those rich foods you and your friends like to eat.""

The President-to-be responds, ""Don't worry Mom. The entire affair is going to be handled by the best caterer in New York; kosher all the way Mom, I really want you to come.""

So Mom reluctantly agrees and on January 20, 2029, Sarah Goldstein is being sworn in as President of the United States. In the front row sits the new President's mother, who leans over to a senator sitting next to her and says, ""You see that woman over there with her hand on the Torah, becoming President of the United States?""

The senator whispers back, ""Yes, I do.""

Mom says proudly, ""Her brother is a doctor.""

hm635l,Jokes,My late Grandfathers favorite joke,"There was an American wrestler from Texas named John, who throughout his high school career had never lost a match. As he went on into college he continued undefeated. He became a national icon and symbol of American strength.

News began to circulate of a Russian wrestler who was fierce and unstoppable. As each wrestlers legends grew, a match was set up between the two, America versus Russia. The match would be held in Texas.

John began training immediately. Every day his coach would tell him, “This Russian has a move called the Mongolian Death Grip. No one has ever escaped the Mongolian Death Grip. DO NOT let him get you in the Mongolian Death Grip”

The day of the match finally came. Just before each wrestler stepped onto the mat in front of the capacity crowd, the coach once again said, “Whatever you do, do not let him get you in the Mongolian death grip. No one has ever escaped the Mongolian death grip”. 

Four seconds into the match, the Russian had the American in the Mongolian death grip. The coach buried his face into his hands and cursed John for not listening to his advice. All of the sudden he heard the crowd irrupt in a chant of USA USA USA. He looked up and saw the Russian pinned by John. The coach ran out to meet John and embarrassingly told him, “I didn’t see... Once he had you in the Mongolian Death Grip I looked away. How in the world did you get out of the Mongolian death grip?”

With heavy breath, John told him “Well coach, that Russian grabbed me and twisted my body in ways I never imagined possible. I was wincing in pain when I open my eyes and right in front of me were two testicles. So I bit them.”

“What???” Said the coach... “John I don’t think that is legal. You could be disqualified”

“I don’t know about that coach. But I can tell you one thing. You ain’t got no idea how strong you are until you bite your own balls”

But his snake lost its appetite, and soon stopped eating altogether; perhaps due to the stress of frequent travel and an irregular diet.


Wishing to save his prized pet, Attila sought help from the local chirurgeons and witch doctors. None of them could do anything for him, until a wizened sage suggested feeding the serpent only young female virgins.


Attila was pleased with this idea, and was delighted to find that a city he had raided just happened to have a Christian convent with a convenient supply of the recommended food for his pet.


But the snake refused to eat, or even touch any of the consecrated virgins from the convent. Enraged, Attila sent for the soothsayer who advised him to have him executed.


Standing before Attila, the old man calmly said, ""Before thou killest me, may thee first bring the snake and one of the women to me.""


Curious, Attila did as he asked.


Then the old man took some bread and gave it to Attila.


""Now hold these in both hands,"" he instructed.


Attila did so, and as soon as he did, the snake let out a terrifying hiss, and swallowed the virgin whole.


To an amazed Attila, the old man simply said,


""Thy anaconda don't want nun unless you've got buns, Hun."""

One day we were taking lots of eggs to the market in a basket on the front seat of the truck when we hit a big bump in the road. The basket fell off the seat and all the eggs broke.” The moral of the story is not to put all your eggs in one basket. “Very good,” said the teacher. Next, Mary said, “We are farmers too. We had twenty eggs waiting to hatch, but when they did we only got ten chicks.” The moral of this story is not to count your chickens before they’re hatched . “Very good,” said the teacher again, very pleased with the response so far.

Next it was Barney’s turn to tell his story: “My dad told me this story about my Aunt Karen. Aunt Karen was a flight engineer in the war and her plane got hit. She had to bail out over enemy territory and all she had was a bottle of whiskey, a machine gun and a machete.” “Go on,” said the teacher, intrigued.

“Aunt Karen drank the whiskey on the way down to prepare herself. Then she landed right in the middle of a hundred enemy soldiers. She killed seventy of them with the machine gun until she ran out of bullets. Then she killed twenty more with the machete till the blade broke. And then she killed the last ten with her bare hands.” “Good heavens,” said the horrified teacher, “What did your father say was the moral of that frightening Story?”

The child said: “Stay away from Aunt Karen when she’s been drinking.”"

Completely shocked he talks to the devil and says: ""Welp, I've been wrong all my life and I guess I'm now to pay the price for my lack of faith""

Satan laughs and replies: ""Awh it's not so bad down here, let me give you the tour so you can see for yourself""

He then proceeds to escort Jack through a beautiful lush green plain with flowers, scattered here and there there's a bunch of houses where other ""damned"" live.

As they pass through each house the inhabitants recognize Satan and invite them inside for a drink and a chat, request that's always granted by the two.

Every time they stop to a house Satan never fails to display how much of a lovely guy he really is by telling amazing stories, singing, cracking jokes and just generally being a great person.

At sunset the devil sees that Jack was very tired and decides to show him the house he'll be spending the rest of eternity into.

As they walk to Jack's new house the two pass close to a huge wall and Jack asks: ""What's behind there?""

Satan: ""Oh, nothing that should concern you, pay it no mind""

Despite his curiosity Jack thought better not to bother Satan with further questions and just followed him to his new house where Satan promised he'd be back the following morning to show him the recreational center before finally bidding him a goodnight after a long day.

That night however Jack kept thinking back at the whole situation he's in and how surreal everything was until his thoughts eventually jumped to the wall he saw earlier in the day.

After a few minutes trying to guess what could there be behind that wall that Satan couldn't even tell him he decided he should investigate, as such he took a deep breath and dived into the night walking back to the place where the wall was.

Once there he searched for some clues until he saw some faint light coming from a spot in the wall; upon closer inspection he saw that there was a hole and the light was coming from behind the wall.

Jack took a deep breath and scrounged up the courage to look into the crack on the wall and what he saw was a spectacle much alike what he always thought hell would be.

On the other side of the wall huge flames were scattered all over a burnt and scalding hot ground and much to his horror he saw other souls inside that nightmare being eternally burned and never consuming, screaming and pleading for help.

Jack rushed back into his place where he just quietly sobbed and cried all night for he was sure now that the Devil was just toying with him to give him a bit of hope right before tossing him into eternal despair.

The following morning Satan showed up once again and told Jack to come with him.

Jack pleaded: ""PLEASE! PLEASE! Don't take me to hell, I'll do anything just let me stay here, I don't wanna burn for all eternity!""

Satan: ""What are you talking about??? I'm just gonna show you the recreational center like I told you yesterday""

Jack: ""Don't lie to me, I saw what was going on behind the giant wall!""

Satan: ""Ooooh you saw that! Don't worry  that's not for you, that's the Christian hell""

Jack: ""The christian hell? Why would the christian hell be like that?""

Satan: ""I don't know either man, they just want it that way""

82j2du,Jokes,Man wakes up in a slum with no memory of how he got there.,"He wanders around aimlessly before he finds even one person who will talk to him. Some ratty beggar on the street turns out to be nice enough to explain where he is.

""You're in the afterlife!"" he tells the man, ""But you must have been a real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here.""

All of a sudden, a siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. The man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to a big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. When the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to a line of folding tables against the wall. Each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. Only then does the man realize how hungry he is. A guard in heavy body armor blows a whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines.

The beggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. ""That one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. All the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. I've heard the food is better there.""

So the man gets his food. It's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. Unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. Even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. The guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. It's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's a bit below average for a real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. All the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. And to his surprise, he runs right into a familiar former beggar as he crosses the street.

""What are the odds?"" they both ask and they get to conversing. The beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself a few months back. Their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like a school bell. When the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like a giant gymnasium. Here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. On a line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. A cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. The beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. ""That's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line."" The man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch.

While he's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, ""The best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. You can never get tired of it!""

Sadly, this proved not to be true. After only a few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. But he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. This time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. Well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. After ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. He went through the gate and found himself in a glittering, clean city full of glass and steel.

And wouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing a well-fitted suit. The man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. Once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. ""Come,"" the beggar told him, ""I'll take you to the evening meal."" So the man followed and they entered a glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. Even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. And sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. One of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. Three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. ""That's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line,"" and then he added, ""and apparently here, they change the meals FOUR times a year!""

The man rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. Four changes a year was enough for him. But one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for a million dollars to pass. Well the man was a bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. ""What is it,"" he thought, ""that could possibly be more wonderful than what I have here?"" That question haunted him for weeks until he came to a conclusion. He was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring.

Fifty years later, he returned to the guards with a million dollars. When he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. The architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. To his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in a golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same.

The beggar laughed jovially. ""I got here only three years ago myself, but somehow I knew you would be right here behind me. I've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in!"" Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to a gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. The room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. Sure enough, there was a line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, a pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. An angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own.

Smiling at the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. ""That's the line for the dragon meat,"" he said before turning to the next line, ""and that's the line for angeldust stew,"" then he paused, confused.

""What is it?"" the man asked his old friend.

The beggar replied, ""There appears to be no punchline.""

Without pause Nick readily agreed to the scheme. 

The next day, Horatio made a batch of itching powder and poured a little bit into the Queen's bra while she bathed. Soon after she dressed, the itching commenced and grew intense. 

Upon being summoned to the Royal Chambers to address this incident, Horatio informed the King and Queen that only a special saliva, if applied for four hours, would cure this type of itch, and that tests had shown that only the saliva of Nick would work as the antidote to cure the itch.

The King, eager to help his Queen, quickly summoned Nick to their chambers. 

Horatio then slipped Nick the antidote for the itching powder, which he put into his mouth, and for the next four hours, Nick worked passionately on the Queen's large and magnificent breasts. The Queen's itching was eventually relieved, and Nick left satisfied and hailed as a hero.

Upon returning to his chamber, Nick found Horatio demanding his payment of 1000 gold coins. With his obsession now satisfied, Nick couldn't have cared less knowing that Horatio could never report this matter to the King and with a laugh told him to get lost.

The next day, Horatio slipped a massive dose of the same itching powder into the King's underwear. The King immediately summoned Nick.

bwvyzi,Jokes,Why was 6 afraid of 7?,"6 never did trust 7. Sure, they worked closely together, but 7 always seemed at odds with him. 6 always preferred the company of 4, a perfect 10 of a duo, even though 2 kept them apart.
But when it came to 7? 6 always summed it up to bad luck. Then, 6 found the truth.
6 respected 9, even though lewd jokes always seemed to be made about the two. 6 found that 3 and himself could come together and be seen as equal to 9. When 9 was removed, 6 had a very negative feeling.
Some were considered prime suspects in 9’s death. 2, 3, 5, and 7. 6 knew it had to be 7. His involvement with 9 added up two well. 
6 snuck into 7’s house. He looked up from the floorboards, and found himself under 7. An admittedly improper position for him, but 6 saw the proof he wanted: 9’s body, half devoured. 7 was a cannibal... 7 8 9.
6 has spent the remainder of his days terrified of 7, worried that someday 7 will learn what 6 knows... And promptly solve his problem."

hd23m7,Jokes,This joke got me fired when I worked as a cook. Credit goes to Jackie “The Joke Man” Martling,"A husband goes to his wife and says “You’re either going hunting with me, sucking my cock or I’m fucking you in the ass. I’m gonna go get the dogs ready and I’ll be back for your answer.” 

After a bit of time, he returns to his wife who defiantly says to him “I’m not going hunting and there’s no way you’re fucking me in the ass!”

“Alright then, guess you’re sucking my cock.”

So she starts to suck him off and quickly spits it out and looks up at him. 

“Your dick tastes like shit!”

“Yeah well, the dogs didn’t want to go hunting either.”

Author’s Notes: WOW! Never thought this would get this much feedback. A few clarifications for anyone asking: 
1. I was in the back end of the kitchen with a fellow cook during a quieter lunch hour when this happened. The place I was working at had been opened less than a month. We had been swapping jokes for a bit before I let this one loose and instead of it being muffled by the sounds of the deep fryer, grill, etc., it was projected out into the main seating area through the ticket window like a speaker. 

2. A customer was the one who ultimately complained to the manager and I was gracefully fired the following day when I walked in to start my shift. I had come from working at a bar previously, so the fact that more sensitive people/families were the ones showing up completely slipped my mind as I was in the back cracking joke with the other chef (a  10+ year veteran of the industry.)The owner was pretty cool with everything all things considered, but explained that they just couldn’t take the risk of something else happening. I even got to say goodbye to everyone before I left, including the head chef who originally hired me, and everyone was really supportive and understanding. 

3. I got a new job shortly after in a warehouse and have been much better off since. I make more money, work less hours, have actual benefits and my bosses are WAY less uptight due to the nature of the job. It was the strangest blessing in disguise I’ve ever received as I don’t know how much longer I wouldn’t lasted in the food industry either way. So in the end, everything worked out."

The first kingdom is rich and powerful, filled with wealthy, prosperous people, the second is more humble, but has its fair share of wealth and power. The third kingdom is struggling and poor, and barely has an army.


The kingdoms eventually go to war over control of the lake, as it's a valuable resource to have. The first kingdom sends 100 of its finest knights, clad in the best armour and each with their own personal squire. The second kingdom sends 50 knights, with fine leather armour and a few dozen squires of their own. The third kingdom sends their one and only knight, an elderly warrior who has long since passed his prime, with his own personal squire. 


The night before the big battle, the knights in the first kingdom drink and party into the late hours of the night. The knights in the second kingdom aren't as well off, but have their own supply of grog and drink well into the night. 


In the third camp, the faithful squire gets a rope and swings it over the branch of a tall tree, making a noose, and hangs a pot from it. He fills the pot with stew and has a humble dinner with the old knight. 


The next morning, the knights in the first two kingdoms are hungover and unable to fight, while the knight in the third kingdom is old weary, unable to get up. In place of the knights, the squires from all three kingdoms go and fight. The battle lasts long into the night but by the time the dust settled, only one squire was left standing - the squire from the third kingdom. 


And it just goes to show you that the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.

In the meantime, we'll pray that science will find a cure for AIDS so that Stacy can get better.

She sure deserves it!

Someday, I'm sure we'll be back to visit so you can get to know your many grandchildren.

John decided to go skiing with his buddy, Keith. So they loaded up John's minivan and headed north. 

After driving for a few hours, they got caught in a terrible blizzard. So they pulled into a nearby farm
and asked the attractive lady who answered the 
door if they could spend the night. 

'I realize it's terrible weather out there and I have
this huge house all to myself, but I'm recently widowed,' she explained. 'I'm afraid the neighbors 
will talk if I let you stay in my house.' 

'Don't worry,' John said. 'We'll be happy to sleep in 
the barn. And if the weather breaks, we'll be gone at first light.' The lady agreed, and the two men found their way to the barn and settled in for the night. 

Come morning, the weather had cleared, and they 
got on their way. 
They enjoyed a great weekend of skiing.

But about nine months later, John got an 
unexpected letter from an attorney. It took him a few minutes to figure it out, but he finally determined 
that it was from the attorney of that attractive widow he had met on the ski weekend. 

He dropped in on his friend Keith and asked, 'Keith, 
do you remember that good-looking widow from the farm we stayed at on our ski holiday up north about
9 months ago?' 

'Yes, I do.' Said Keith.

'Did you, er, happen to get up in the middle of the night, go up to the house and pay her a visit?' 

'Well, um, yes!,' Keith said, a little embarrassed 
about being found out,'I have to admit that I did.' 

'And did you happen to give her my name instead of telling her your name?'

Keith's face turned beet red and he said,
'Yeah, look, I'm sorry, buddy. I'm afraid I did.' 'Why 
do you ask?' 


She just died and left me everything.'

As the bus rolled up and it became her turn to get on, she became aware that her skirt was too tight to allow her leg to come up to the height of the first step on the bus.

 Slightly embarrassed and with a quick smile to the bus driver, she reached behind and unzipped her skirt a little, thinking that this would give her enough slack to raise her leg. 

Again, she tried to make the step onto the bus, only to discover she still couldn't!

Then, I waved my finger around my head to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us. Finally, I pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us of all our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin. He bested me at every move and I could not continue!""

Meanwhile, the Jewish community gathered to ask the Rabbi how he had won. 

""I don't have a clue!!!"" the Rabbi said.
